    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. From the examples provided, age seems to play a role. Younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates, so I'd consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested 7 times and convicted. A high number of prior arrests is a strong indicator. This suggests he's not deterred by previous consequences, which is a significant concern. So, this factor should be weighted as high.\n\nHis current weight is between 150-174 lbs. While weight isn't directly tied to recidivism, being in that range might contribute to health issues or physical strain, but it's unclear how that ties to arrest behavior. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be both a risk and protective factor. Without the structure of a family or marriage, he might have fewer supports, increasing the likelihood of continued criminal behavior. This is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a key indicator; lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. This should be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to frustration and higher crime rates, especially if there are few opportunities. No jobs are definitely a risk, likely medium to high.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of future behavior, but it's often associated with criminal activity. Considering this, it's a medium risk factor.\n\nSome days he feels so down that nothing cheers him up. Depression or emotional instability can lead to impulsive behaviors, which might result in further arrests. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban environment and with a single parent might have contributed to his current situation. This could be a medium risk factor since it's linked to environmental factors that can influence behavior.\n\nHe considers God having nothing to do with his life, which means he lacks spiritual support or guidance. Without such supports, individuals may struggle more to find meaning or change their behavior, increasing recidivism risk. Maybe a medium risk here.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor's weight should reflect how strongly it contributes to recidivism. High factors like prior arrests and living alone have the most significant impact, so they'll be high. Factors like education, employment, and drug use are also important but maybe medium. Age is somewhat lower, as younger adults might still have a chance for change, but considering his history, it's more of a medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates, and at 22, he may still be in a period where behavior is less settled.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: A high number of prior arrests and convictions strongly indicates a pattern of behavior that is likely to repeat.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: While not directly linked, being in this weight range may contribute to physical or mental health factors that could affect behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone without a family structure can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education and employment often correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Unemployment can lead to frustration and higher crime rates, especially without job opportunities\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Drug use is a common factor associated with criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of further arrests\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Feeling down or having emotional issues can lead to impulsive behaviors that may result in rearrest\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in an urban area with a single parent is linked to environmental factors that can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"spiritual_support\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Without spiritual or social supports, individuals might struggle more to change their behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
