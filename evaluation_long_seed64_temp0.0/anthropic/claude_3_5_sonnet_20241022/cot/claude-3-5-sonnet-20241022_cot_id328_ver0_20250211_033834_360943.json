She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
