Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 8.
