She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
