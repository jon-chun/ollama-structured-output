Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
