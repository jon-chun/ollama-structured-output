Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area.
