Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
