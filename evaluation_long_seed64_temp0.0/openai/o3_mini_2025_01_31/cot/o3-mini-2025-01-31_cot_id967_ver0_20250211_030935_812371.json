Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
