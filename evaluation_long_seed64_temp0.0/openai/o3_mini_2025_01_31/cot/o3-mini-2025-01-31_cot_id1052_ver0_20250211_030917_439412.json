Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
