Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area.
