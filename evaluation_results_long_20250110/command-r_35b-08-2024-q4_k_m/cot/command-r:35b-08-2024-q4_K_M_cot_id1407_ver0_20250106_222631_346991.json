She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 105 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 1 job during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 10, in an urban area.
