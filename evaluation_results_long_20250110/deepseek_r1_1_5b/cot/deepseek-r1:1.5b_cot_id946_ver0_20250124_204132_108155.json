    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this young woman's recidivism risk over the next three years. Let me start by breaking down each factor provided.\n\nShe's a 22-year-old female from a White background with a GED, not in college, no recent job history, and has lived alone for most of her life. The family is small, nine members. She lived with adults other than biological parents, foster or adoptive, in this household. That's significant because it affects how she feels about the situation.\n\nShe's separated and living alone now. She used to be arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She has a 5'5\" height and weighs 214 lbs. She's had some emotional downfalls\u2014down in the dumps sometimes, and that time she felt so down. That could affect her motivation.\n\nShe's not involved with anyone else and isn't using drugs. But the past month was especially tough. I should consider how these factors might influence recidivism.\n\nLooking at each factor:\n\n1. **Family background**: A small family without a biological parent can make it harder for someone to feel secure, which might affect them feeling motivated or capable again. That could be a low risk factor because she's isolated and might not have the support they need to stay away from their old situation.\n\n2. **Marital status/being separated**: Separation can lead to feelings of isolation and loss, making it harder to return to life. That's another low risk factor.\n\n3. **Living alone**: This is similar to being separated; living without any family or friends adds stress and difficulty in adjusting. Low risk again.\n\n4. **No recent jobs**: This means she was working before getting arrested, which might give her some hope of finding new work opportunities. However, the fact that she hasn't been convicted yet complicates things because it's uncertain if she'll ever get a chance to break free from her previous situation.\n\n5. **No previous job history or substance use**: While she's not in a job now, she might have had some success before getting arrested. But since she hasn't been convicted and is living alone, that adds uncertainty about whether she can get the support needed for recidivism.\n\n6. **Emotional state**: Feeling down, especially in the dumps, could reduce motivation to stay in her old situation or return. This might make her less likely to attempt recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: She's isolated, living alone, and without a clear path back to her former life due to lack of support and job history. The uncertainty about getting caught again adds to the risk. Given these factors, I'd estimate her risk to be very low. So yes, she is unlikely to rearrest in three years.\n</think>\n\nThe individual's circumstances present significant challenges for recidivism, including isolation, living alone, lack of support from a family without biological parentage, and uncertainty about re-entering the situation after being convicted. The combined factors suggest a very low risk for rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Isolated family with no biological parent\", \"low\", \"She is separated and living alone, which can make it harder to feel secure and motivated again.
