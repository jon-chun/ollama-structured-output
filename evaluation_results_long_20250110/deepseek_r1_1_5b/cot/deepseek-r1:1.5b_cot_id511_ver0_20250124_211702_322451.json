He has a high school diploma in college prep and uses marijuana occasionally but struggles with depression feelings.\n\nI need to assess each factor for recidivism risk. The first point about his age (19) being younger than most adults suggests higher risk because of increased criminal behavior. His living situation alone might also increase risk, especially if he's isolated or in a household of three.\n\nHis background as a Black man with no college degree and an enrolled diploma indicates potential for recidivism due to social factors, but his arrest history shows intent, not just hoping.\n\nThe drug use is concerning because substance abuse can lead to mental health issues like depression. His struggle with feelings of despair adds another layer that could worsen recidivist behaviors.\n\nPutting this together, the age and living situation are strong indicators of higher risk. The arrest history, substance use, and feeling of despair all contribute to a significant likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"19 years old\", \"medium\", \"young people often exhibit higher levels of criminal behavior compared to adults who have completed high school or are employed.

However, the arrest history suggests a higher intent to reoffend than typical cases with lower education levels.\"), \n    (\"used marijuana and struggles with depression\", \"high\", \"substance abuse can lead to mental health issues such as depression.

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3.
