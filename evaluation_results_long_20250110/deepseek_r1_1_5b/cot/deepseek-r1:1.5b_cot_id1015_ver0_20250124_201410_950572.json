    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has given a detailed scenario about a 19-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. He's an adult, single, never married, doesn't have any education or college enrollment. He has three jobs and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. He used marijuana but feels no depression. His upbringing was with his biological mother, and he now lives alone in an urban area. \n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: At 19, that doesn't seem too bad, especially if he's living alone. Single people are generally less likely to commit crimes compared to married individuals. But since it's a young adult and his family is small, maybe not the highest risk.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: He's single, which reduces criminal behavior compared to someone who has kids or a family. However, he did get arrested twice, so this could still be a moderate risk factor.\n\n3. **Education/GED**: No diploma or GED. That seems like a high risk because lacking formal education can lead to poor job prospects and higher chances of involvement in criminal activities.\n\n4. **Job History**: He has three jobs, which shows he's active and capable. This isn't a significant risk factor but adds some stability.\n\n5. **Drug Use History (2018-2021)**: He used marijuana for 2019 and 2020. marijuana is a known drug that can be dangerous and sometimes leads to recidivism, especially if someone has low self-control or experiences mental health issues. But since he's young, maybe this isn't as pronounced.\n\n6. **Depression/Affecting Well-Being (Last Month)**: He hasn't felt depressed for the past month. This could reduce his risk of criminal behavior and recidivism compared to those who have depression or other mental health issues.\n\n7. **Residence**: Lives alone in an urban area, which can make someone less likely to commit crimes if they're isolated because there's no support network to rely on. But this is a low risk factor since he has three jobs.\n\n8. **Family Background (Biological Mother)**: He was raised by his biological mother, who might have influenced his criminal behavior negatively, but given he's single and living alone now, the family's impact is minimized.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors, the lack of education or GED is a major risk factor. Without formal education, he can't obtain the knowledge needed to commit crimes. The fact that he uses marijuana adds some concern, especially if he hasn't dealt with mental health issues in the past month. His family background being small also plays a role.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, even though he's single and living alone, his lack of education or GED might still pose a significant risk. Therefore, I would predict that this person has a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"no diploma or GED certificate\", \"low\", \"lacks formal education and job prospects, reducing his criminal behavior potential\"),\n    (\"2019-2020 marijuana use (moderate)\", \"medium\", \"marijuana can be dangerous and sometimes lead to recidivism if someone lacks mental health coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"no depression in past month\", \"low\", \"mild or no impact on his criminal behavior since he's young\"),\n    (\"single living alone in urban area (low)\", \"low\", \"isolated and without family support minimizes risks\"),\n    (\"3 jobs in 2019-2021\", \"medium\", \"activity and capability but not a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"no depression/mental health issues in last month\", \"low\", \"moderate mental health impact but low recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
