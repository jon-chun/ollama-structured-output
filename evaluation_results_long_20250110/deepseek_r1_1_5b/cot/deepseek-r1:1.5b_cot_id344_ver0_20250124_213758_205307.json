    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is a criminal risk assessment expert. They asked me to analyze a specific case using advanced statistical and judicial knowledge. Let's break down how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I considered each risk factor one by one. The person was a 20-year-old female with no college education. Her background as a criminal history of 1 time in a rural area made her vulnerable. She also lived alone, which adds to the stress and potential recidivism risk.\n\nHer drug use over four years is concerning. Using marijuana and cocaine at such a young age could have negative impacts on mental health and self-esteem. The situation she was living with as a child being rural might affect her social integration and life stability.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 180 lbs, which are physical traits that could influence behavior. The lack of support from biological parents is another factor\u2014she would face isolation and possibly isolate herself further.\n\nHer drug use over the past month in an emotional state suggests a low-quality substance use environment. This could lead to negative mental health outcomes and stress, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nThe person considers God as part of her life but doesn't link it directly with her behavior. While religious influences can play a role in mental health, this isn't the strongest factor here.\n\nPutting all these together, I estimated a high risk. The physical vulnerability, lack of support, and potential negative environment all contribute significantly to recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"physical/violence\", \"medium\", \"She has no college education but has been arrested once, in a rural area with a household of size 5.
