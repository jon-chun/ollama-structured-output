    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this young male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old, which is pretty young. At that age, there are significant factors like substance abuse and mental health issues. He used drugs regularly, including marijuana and cocaine, and felt down sometimes, which might indicate underlying mental health problems. That seems high for his age.\n\nNext, he has no college education, being just a 19-year-old without enrollment. This alone is concerning because many young people drop out of school early or face financial instability later, especially if they're dealing with substance abuse. The lack of higher education and employment opportunities further compounds this risk.\n\nHe's living on his own, which is another big factor. Most people move to apartments for safety reasons, so living alone can lead to serious issues like domestic violence, mental health problems, and increased risk of rearrest due to isolation.\n\nHis parents are in the household, making him an adoptive family member. Adoption can be a very risky area because adoption laws vary by country, cultural norms, and the emotional state of adopted children. It's high risk because he might face adoption issues or neglect.\n\nHe has used drugs for four years but hasn't recovered yet, especially with some time feeling down. That shows a potential relapse risk without a cure in mind, which adds to his overall rearrest risk.\n\nHis parents are still around, so he's close family members, increasing the likelihood of domestic abuse if there's an issue arising from their relationship or living situation. It's high because family members can have strong emotional bonds that lead to serious problems.\n\nHe has no jobs and a stable lifestyle, which means he doesn't contribute financially, but it also puts pressure on his mental health. The financial strain might affect his ability to handle substance use, another significant factor.\n\nHis upbringing is simple with a household of size six, meaning there's not much social interaction or support for him. This isolation can lead to mental health issues and higher risk of rearrest from neglect or abuse.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor individually contributes to the overall risk. The lack of education, living alone, being an adoptive family member, and drug use without recovery make this individual a high-risk rearrester. His parents' presence is also crucial because family issues can escalate serious problems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"has substance abuse problem\", \"medium\", \"substance abuse for four years, occasional feelings of down; may indicate underlying mental health issues\"),\n    (\"no higher education and not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"early dropping out or financial instability as he struggles with substance use\"),\n    (\"lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6\", \"high\", \"simple family, potential for domestic abuse if issues arise\"),\n    (\"adothical family member\", \"high\", \"family members can have strong emotional bonds leading to serious problems\"),\n    (\"no jobs and stable lifestyle\", \"medium\", \"financial strain may affect ability to handle substance use\"),\n    (\"complex life with no higher education and no college enrollment\", \"low\", \"early dropping out or financial instability as he struggles with substance use\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
