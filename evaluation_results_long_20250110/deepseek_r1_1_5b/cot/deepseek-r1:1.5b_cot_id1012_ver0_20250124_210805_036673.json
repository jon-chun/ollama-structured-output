    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the information provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the relevant risk factors that could contribute to her recidivism. The user has given several points to consider:\n\n1. Age: She's 21, which is fairly young for criminal behavior.\n2. Gender: Black, though gender typically isn't a significant factor in recidivism rates as much as race and socioeconomic status.\n3. Previous arrest history: 1 time, convicted.\n4. Current status: Urban residence, single, no current job.\n5. Substance use: Past four years with marijuana and cocaine, and current downfalls leading to feeling depressed.\n6. Family background: Lived with biological mom in a 4-person household, possibly supporting her financially.\n\nNow, I should evaluate each risk factor's likelihood of contributing to recidivism. Starting with age, being 21 is not extremely young, so there might be some risk. But since she's young and has only one arrest, the risk seems moderate.\n\nNext, gender isn't a huge concern here because recidivism rates are generally lower for certain genders compared to others. So I would estimate her risk based on other factors but keep it in mind.\n\nHer past arrest history is just once, which is rare. In general, repeat offenders have higher recidivism rates than never offenders, so one arrest might not be a strong indicator of potential reoffending.\n\nShe's currently living alone, and that usually helps with recidivism because there are fewer support networks to rely on. Urban residence could also play a role, as areas may have different recidivist behaviors or laws against convicted individuals.\n\nAs for substance use, she has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and now faces downfalls due to low mood. This shows a level of substance abuse that might be associated with recidivism, but it's not conclusive on its own. I'd consider this as a possible risk factor.\n\nHer family background living with her biological mother in a household of four could provide some support or environment conducive to reoffending if the individual is motivated by external pressures like the family.\n\nPutting all these together: age, gender (relatively low), previous offense count (just one), living alone, urban residence, substance use patterns, and family background. These factors suggest that while she has a moderate risk of recidivism, it's not extremely high because her circumstances don't place her in the highest-risk category.\n\nTherefore, my prediction would be that there is a low probability of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21-year-old is fairly young for criminal behavior and has only one arrest history\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender isn't a significant factor in recidivism rates as much as race and socioeconomic status.\"),\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once, which is rare and uncommon for repeat offenders but not conclusive on its own\"),\n    (\"current_status\", \"medium\", \"She's living alone and in an urban area, which can sometimes provide some support or environment conducive to reoffending if the individual is motivated by external pressures like family conflicts`),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"moderate\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and now faces downfalls due to low mood.

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
