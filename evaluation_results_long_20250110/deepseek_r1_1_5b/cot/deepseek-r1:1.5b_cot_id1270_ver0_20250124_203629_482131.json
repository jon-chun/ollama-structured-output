    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Hispanic male who's lived with his biological mother in an urban area. He's young and hasn't had much contact yet. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, being a freshman means he might not have any relevant experience yet, so factors like substance abuse or drug use could be high because they're starting fresh. But since he's lived with his mom for four years, maybe some patterns from that time are still present, but it's early on.\n\nHis lack of education is a big issue. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. That likely affects his ability to handle any substance use or further criminal behavior because they might rely on skills learned in college. But he did use marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, so maybe this can be mitigated.\n\nHis living situation is quite urban with a family of size 4. Urban areas have higher crime rates generally, but since he's been living there for four years without any issues, it might mean less exposure to current criminals or factors that cause recidivism. But being in a city could still lead to social influences that contribute to reoffending.\n\nHis lack of employment and education complicates his ability to provide support if needed. If someone tries to help him, he might not be able to handle the situation, increasing his risk. But he has used substances, which is already a positive sign towards recidivism.\n\nHis living alone reduces opportunities for support systems, but it also means less supervision and community interaction. This could make him more vulnerable if he misbehaves or is exposed to criminal activities.\n\nHis past drug use shows some commitment, so that's a good point. However, substance abuse can be reintroduced into society, especially among young people who haven't had much time to develop new coping mechanisms.\n\nHis lack of social support from peers and family might make him more susceptible to reoffending if he tries to act on his feelings or mistakes. But since he's lived with his mom in a family setting for four years, maybe there are some older neighbors or friends who can offer guidance.\n\nOverall, while he has some positive experiences like drug use and substance abuse, the lack of education, living situation, and being alone could significantly increase his risk. However, it might be manageable if he can develop skills to handle situations without assistance.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"negative factor\", \"low\", \"young person with limited experience in criminal behavior, especially substance abuse in a family setting for four years; no formal education, living alone in urban area; lack of support systems and social networks that could contribute to reoffending\"),\n    (\"positive factor\", \"high\", \"has used marijuana and cocaine, showing commitment to substance use which is an early sign of reoffending; past drug use indicates he may reintroduce substances into society without formal support\"),\n    (\"negative factor\", \"low\", \"lacks education that could prepare him for further criminal behavior; living in a city with higher crime rates but with family influence can limit exposure to current criminals; urban setting increases social influences contributing to reoffending\"),\n    (\"positive factor\", \"medium\", \"unfortunately, he has no formal education or GED certificate, which is a significant barrier to acquiring the skills needed for further criminal behavior in the future\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
