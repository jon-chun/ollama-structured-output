    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't too bad. She's an adult, but she was just arrested once and hasn't been convicted. That's a positive sign because it means she's not on the hook for immediate release or punishment. She's White, which I'm assuming gives her some social acceptance and might support her behavior.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 6 inches and 160 lbs. Her weight isn't concerning here since recidivism is more about mental health and substance use than physical factors. But it does contribute to a comfortable living situation, so that's a plus.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone, which might mean less stress or pressure from social interactions. That could translate into better relationships at work or in social circles, which can help with recidivism if she feels isolated mentally.\n\nLiving in a rural household of size three is another positive environment. Rural communities often have fewer distractions and provide more stability than urban areas. This could mean less chance of random violence or other issues that lead to reoffending.\n\nHer background is straightforward: two jobs, not enrolled in college, has held 2 jobs during the year, hasn't used drugs, and has had some emotional down time. Emotional instability can sometimes lead to substance use or behavior changes, but since she's not actively using substances and dealing with low stress now, it might be safer.\n\nShe identifies as White, which could influence her behavior positively in social settings. It doesn't directly contribute to recidivism risk factors, but it does offer a more stable environment emotionally and socially.\n\nIn terms of substance use, she hasn't engaged in any recent drug use, so that's good. But the past month having \"so down\" suggests she might need professional help or further exploration into her behavior. This could lead to substance abuse if not addressed.\n\nOverall factors don't heavily indicate a risk because her age is young, she's never convicted, living in a stable rural environment, and her previous experiences were mostly emotional rather than problematic. However, without more information on substance use or other issues like substance abuse, the risk might be considered moderate or low.\n\nBut considering all these positive aspects\u2014stable environment, no convictions yet, emotional stability\u2014it makes me lean towards a lower recidivism risk. So the prediction would likely result in \"NO\" with some uncertainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Stable and emotionally stable living situation\", \"low\", \"She has a comfortable living environment, which may reduce reoffending risks.\",\n    \"Living in a rural household of size three likely provides a more stable environment than urban settings.\",\n    \"She has not been convicted yet and has no recent substance use issues.\",\n    \"Her background as an adult without previous convictions is favorable.\",\n    \"She identifies with her community emotionally, which may facilitate better relationships.\",\n    \"She has two jobs but does not engage in substance use recently.\",\n    \"The past month of emotional dip suggests she may need professional help or further exploration.\",\n    \"No recent substance use issues.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
