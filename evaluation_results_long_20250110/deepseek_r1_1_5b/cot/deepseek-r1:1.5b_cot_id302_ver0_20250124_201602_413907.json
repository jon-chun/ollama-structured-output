Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once, convicted, and is currently living alone without being married. At 5'3\" and 135 lbs, she has a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. She's lived with her biological mother in a small family of five for four years and now lives in an urban area.\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these factors are significant indicators that might increase recidivism risk. She never married, so that's a point to consider because being alone could affect relationships and emotional support.\n\nShe's lived with her biological mother in a small family, which might have influenced her behavior during foster care. The family size is small (household of 5), but since she's living alone now, that might be less of an issue. However, having only five members could mean more stress or uncertainty about her future relationship.\n\nShe's currently living alone and in an urban area. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so that could increase recidivism risk. She's been using marijuana for the past four years and feels down sometimes, which might contribute to substance use issues or mental health problems that could impact reoffending.\n\nSince she has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, her education background is limited, which might affect higher education requirements if any apply. This lack of formal training could be a barrier to reentry programs.\n\nShe's been convicted of past crimes and currently serving time. The prior convictions could influence recidivism patterns depending on their intent and circumstances. However, she hasn't been convicted of anything specific, so it's unclear yet.\n\nHer family size being small might have influenced her behavior in foster care, which is typically a vulnerable group. Living alone could mean more uncertainty about her future relationship with a partner, affecting how she interacts with others.\n\nShe has substance use history and experiences of down time. These behaviors might correlate with substance abuse or stress that could contribute to recidivism if they worsen.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, especially the small family size, living alone in an urban area, and her substance use patterns, there's a significant risk she might reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"small family size\", \"low\" because smaller families may have less support for children and may lead to more uncertainty about future relationships),\n    (\"living alone in an urban area\", \"high\" because urban areas are generally associated with higher crime rates, and living alone increases uncertainty and stress),\n    (\"substance use history and experiences of down time\", \"low\" or high? It's a mix; substance abuse can lead to reoffending if worsened, so it depends on context and severity)\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
