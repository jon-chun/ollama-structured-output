    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user provided a detailed query where they want me to act as an expert criminal justice risk assessment expert. They're using advanced statistical and judicial knowledge to assess risks for a specific case over three years. The user's goal is to predict whether this individual will rearrest based on various risk factors and assign weights accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the query correctly. The user has given a structured JSON response template they expect, so my task is to fill that in accurately. They have provided all the necessary information about the individual: age, gender, marital status, living situation, education, previous jobs, drug use, depression history, and religious beliefs.\n\nI should start by evaluating each risk factor one by one. The individual is 19, male, White, 6'5\", 220 lbs, single, currently in school, has one job, hasn't used drugs or felt depressed, living with his father in a small family. They identify God as a significant part of their life.\n\nFor each factor, I'll assess the likelihood of rearrest over three years:\n\n1. **Family Size (3 members)**: Larger families might have more resources and support systems, potentially reducing recidivism. So, medium weight.\n2. **Marital Status (single)**: Lower risk compared to married individuals. Medium weight.\n3. **Living alone**: Reduced opportunities for contact with the criminal justice system. Low weight.\n4. **Education (current student)**: Younger adults may have better employability and fewer alternatives. Medium weight.\n5. **Previous job (part-time or other)**: Lower risk compared to full-time students or non-criminal jobs. Medium weight.\n6. **No drug use**: Not a significant risk factor. Low weight.\n7. **Depression history (past month)**: High depression can sometimes lead to recidivism, but this is a minor factor. Medium weight.\n8. **Identified as God**: This is a personal religious belief and not a legitimate risk factor. Low weight.\n\nNow, I'll sum the weights: Family size 3 \u2192 2.5, Single \u2192 1.5, Alone \u2192 -0, Education student \u2192 2, Previous job part-time or other \u2192 2, No drugs \u2192 -0, Depressed \u2192 1, ID God \u2192 -0. Total around 7. Since the average is below 8, it's a low risk. Therefore, prediction is NO with a confidence of medium.\n\nI need to ensure each factor is covered and that the reasoning aligns with the provided data. I should also make sure the JSON structure matches exactly what the user expects, without any extra text or formatting errors. This will help them use my analysis effectively in their risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"The household size of three members may provide more resources and support systems for the individual living alone.\",\n    \"1.5\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"As a single person, there are fewer opportunities to engage with the criminal justice system or receive support from family.\",\n    \"1\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces the chances of contact with the criminal justice system and community support, which may lower recidivism rates.\",\n    \"-0.5\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"A 19-year-old student has better employability skills than older individuals or those in non-criminal jobs, which can reduce recidivism.\",\n    \"1\"),\n    (\"previous_job\", \"medium\", \"A part-time or other type of job may offer less contact with the criminal justice system compared to full-time students or non-criminal jobs, but there are still opportunities for support and community engagement.\",\n    \"2\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use\", \"low\", \"No significant risk factors related to drug use.
