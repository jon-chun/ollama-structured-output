    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user provided a detailed query about risk factors for recidivism prediction. They want me to analyze each factor step by step, assign weights, and then make a prediction with confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each risk factor one by one. For example, the person is 22, which might indicate they haven't had enough time to commit again. Also, he's an adult without a high school diploma, which could be a red flag for criminal behavior in their late teens and early twenties.\n\nHis arrests history shows he's already been convicted, so past behavior is a strong indicator of future actions. The age being young might make him less likely to reoffend due to psychological factors like curiosity and lack of support at home.\n\nThe person has lived with his parents for 6 people in an urban area. Urban environments can be stressful but sometimes provide mental health support, which could contribute to recidivism. However, the high cost of living might also affect job prospects and opportunities outside the home.\n\nThe family size is small, possibly affecting access to education or housing elsewhere. The lack of jobs means he's more likely to seek work, which could lead to a successful career and eventual reintegration into society.\n\nDrugs used in the past four years indicate substance use, which is a clear indicator of potential recidivism. The absence of feelings of depression over the past month suggests mental health issues that might hinder his ability to reintegrate.\n\nHe's from a young age raised by his parents, so there might be fewer resources available for him at home and potentially elsewhere. This could lead to more isolated situations where he can't get the help needed.\n\nLooking at each factor, the oldest factors like substance abuse and mental health are more likely to contribute significantly. The younger factors about being an adult, living alone, and education access are also important but might have a lesser impact compared to the older ones.\n\nI should consider that recidivism is typically higher in older adults with lower life stability. The person's situation shows he's young, urban, single, and from a family with fewer resources, which all point towards a lower risk of reoffending.\n\nSo, after evaluating each factor and weighing their influence, I'd say the probability is high that he won't rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"His history of using marijuana over the past four years strongly indicates a potential for recidivism.
