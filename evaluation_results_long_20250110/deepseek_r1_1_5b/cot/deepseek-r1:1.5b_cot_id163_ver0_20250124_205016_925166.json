    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the recidivism risk for this young woman. She's 19, white, has been arrested once, convicted, with a high school diploma but hasn't gone to college yet. She's living alone, never married, and she's 5 feet 9 inches tall. Her weight is 135 lbs. She doesn't have any family support issues mentioned.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014cocaine and marijuana\u2014and has had some emotional\u4f4e\u70b9 recently, like feeling down and depressed for a while. At age 19, she's in a household of size 4. She considers God to have something to do with her personal struggles.\n\nNow, I need to break this down into risk factors. Let's see... Her age is young, which can make recidivism more likely because there are fewer opportunities and no support systems. She's single, so she has less family support, which might reduce support for reoffending. She's not in college, meaning she doesn't have higher education support, but that might also limit her access to better resources.\n\nShe's lived in a household of 4 before, so maybe there are some people around who could help, like neighbors or friends. But being single and isolated might make it harder for others to assist her. She used drugs extensively, which is concerning because drug use can lead to reoffending due to addiction, mental health issues, and financial instability.\n\nShe's feeling low emotionally\u2014this can lower her motivation and willingness to participate in reoffending. The household size being small could mean she has fewer people around for support compared to someone with a larger family.\n\nPutting this together: She's young, single, not in college, in a relatively small household, has drug use history, emotional lows, and no family support mentioned beyond the small household. All these factors contribute to a high risk of rearrest.\n\nSo I'll categorize each factor as high because they are all significant contributors to low recidivism chances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high\", \"She's young, single, not in college, lives in a small household, and has drug use history that can lead to reoffending due to addiction, emotional struggles, and financial instability.\",\n    \"High\" // This factor is significant because it includes her age, status alone, lack of higher education support, emotionally low status, and drug use history which can contribute to reoffending.\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
