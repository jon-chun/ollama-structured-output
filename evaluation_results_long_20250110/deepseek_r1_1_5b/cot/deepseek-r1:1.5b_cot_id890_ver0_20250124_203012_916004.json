    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking me to analyze a criminal risk prediction for someone who's an adult. They've provided a detailed profile with various factors like age, gender, past convictions, weight, living situation, education level, drug use history, emotional state, and background.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each factor to determine its risk level. Age being 22 is young but not too old, so that might affect recidivism rates. She's a White female, which could influence societal factors affecting her criminal behavior. Having been arrested twice means she has some prior history, which increases the risk.\n\nLooking at weight, she's in a healthy range, which is good for general health. Living alone might put additional stress on her mental and physical health. Education level is associate/junior college, so higher than high school but lower than university. This could indicate she hasn't fully explored her interests or has some gaps.\n\nHer past drug use is significant, especially since she's a 22-year-old with a history of using marijuana and cocaine. High drug use might relate to other issues like substance abuse, which could contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe's been living with her biological mother in a small household for five years. This might indicate social support but also possible challenges in adjusting to new circumstances. Her emotional state shows she's feeling down, especially during the dumps period, which is stressful and can increase recidivism risk.\n\nHer education level isn't very advanced, so she may have gaps in knowledge or skills that could influence her behavior. The fact that she's using drugs means she might engage in criminal activities despite not being lawfully charged yet.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors point to a moderate risk of rearrest within three years. The user wants this analyzed as a JSON object with prediction and confidence. I'll structure each factor with its reasoning and then calculate an overall confidence based on the weights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"A 22-year-old is relatively young, but the specific age of 22 doesn't provide a clear indication of recidivism risk unless contextually relevant factors are considered (e.g., education level, employment status, etc.)\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"As a White female, societal and cultural expectations may influence criminal behavior, though individual circumstances like personal values and support systems play additional roles\"),\n    (\"past convictions\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested twice, indicating prior criminal history which can increase the likelihood of recidivism regardless of current circumstances\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Her weight is within a healthy range, suggesting general health and potential to avoid long-term health issues that could relate to criminal behavior (e.g., cardiovascular risks)\"),\n    (\"single living\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to stress, anxiety, and isolatedness, which may increase the likelihood of committing crimes or engaging in criminal activities\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"A associate/junior college education provides some academic freedom but leaves gaps that may influence future decisions regarding criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"Her past drug use is significant and may relate to other issues like substance abuse, which can contribute to recidivism),\n    (\"down in dumps period\", \"high\", \"This emotional state shows a deep-seated frustration and stress that can lead to higher rates of criminal behavior despite not being legally charged\"),\n    (\"gaps in knowledge/skills\", \"medium\", \"A lower educational level may mean she has gaps in skills or knowledge, which could affect her decision-making and future criminal activities\"),\n    (\"social support\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a small household may provide some social stability, but it also may limit opportunities for self-discovery and personal growth that can influence criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has completed study at an associate/junior college and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
