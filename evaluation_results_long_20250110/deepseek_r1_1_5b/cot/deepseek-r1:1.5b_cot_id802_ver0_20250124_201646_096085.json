    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's facing a rearrest. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White male at 5 feet 8 inches with a 155-pound weight. He hasn't been convicted but has been arrested once. That's not particularly concerning on its own, so I'll mark that as medium risk. He's never married and lives alone, which is less risky than someone who is already married or living in a stable home.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma without a college degree, and he's not enrolled. This is an educational factor; while it's important, it might be more of a risk factor if his background affects recidivism rates. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe never held two jobs during the year but has held 2 jobs overall. This shows some work history that could indicate potential issues, especially if he was laid off or had job instability. That sounds like a high risk because unstable employment can lead to reoffending.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents in a household of size five. This is quite common and doesn't directly indicate a criminal behavior. So I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nHis substance use history: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, including some time feeling so down that nothing could cheer him up. That's a clear pattern of substance abuse with relapses. This should be high risk because substance abuse is a significant indicator of recidivism.\n\nHe considers God not to have an impact on his personal life, which might lead to self-compassion or low-level behavior despite being accused. But since he's a teenager, his actions might be influenced by social support or lack of guidance from adults. That could be medium risk because there are factors that can contribute but aren't conclusive.\n\nPutting it all together: the main risks are substance abuse and possibly some underlying issues due to living alone or unstable employment. However, the stable environment with both parents at home might mitigate those risks. The overall assessment is high risk because of significant substance use history and possible social influences.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\"),\n    (\"stable_environment\", \"medium\", \"he considered God not to have an impact on his personal life, which might lead to self-compassion or low-level behavior despite being accused\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
