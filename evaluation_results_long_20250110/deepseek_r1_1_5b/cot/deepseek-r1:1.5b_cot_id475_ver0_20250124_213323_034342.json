    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person has a high chance of rearresting in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She's married and living with her spouse. That gives her some stability because people around her might be supportive if they're compatible with their values. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism rates. Maybe she has more support from her family, but does that make her less likely to reoffend? Not sure.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 180 lbs. That sounds healthy for a person her age, so maybe that doesn't directly affect her risk. But being tall can sometimes be associated with different behaviors or opportunities, but I don't know how that plays into recidivism specifically.\n\nShe's white, which might mean she has more resources and opportunities in terms of education and career choices. Maybe that gives her more stability and support when facing a new challenge after being released from prison. But again, not sure if that's directly a risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That could be concerning because it means there were issues with her release and handling. Having the chance to re-arrest might make people more cautious about her behavior or support for criminal acts. I'm thinking she might have some recidivist tendencies, especially if she's facing new challenges after being released.\n\nShe's 4 jobs during the year\u2014uses marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed over the past month. The use of marijuana is concerning because it can be a highly dangerous drug. It might lead to serious issues like addiction or mental health struggles, which could make her more prone to criminal behavior again. Also, feeling not depressed might have been a positive experience, but if she's had a stressful time before, that might impact her later.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, possibly in an urban area. Urban areas can offer opportunities for better housing or higher education, which could contribute to lower recidivism rates because they're more stable. But I'm not sure how strongly that impacts specifically on reoffending.\n\nGod having something to do with her personal life\u2014she's a young person who identifies with God and has lived with her parents before. That might be a positive influence in terms of supporting her values, which could help her in the long run but don't directly add risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: she's stable financially, married, living in an urban area. The past two arrests are concerning, and having the chance to re-arrest adds some pressure. The use of marijuana is a significant risk because it can lead to serious mental health issues or addiction. Feeling not depressed might have been positive but could have contributed to her behavior.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards yes, she has a high chance of rearresting in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"past two arrests indicate risk and possible reoffending\"),\n    (\"family/career support\", \"low\", \"stability from her marriage and family presence supports predictability\"),\n    (\"marijuana use\", \"high\", \"significant risk of criminal behavior due to potential addiction or mental health issues\"),\n    (\"relieved past experience\", \"medium\", \"positive experience may have influenced future behavior\"),\n    (\"depressed mood over time\", \"low\", \"recovery from depression might have contributed to her behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 180 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse.
