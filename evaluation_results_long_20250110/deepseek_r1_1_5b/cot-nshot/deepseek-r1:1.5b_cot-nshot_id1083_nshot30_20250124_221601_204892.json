    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black male who's lived in a big household. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at his background: He's Black, has been arrested twice and convicted, which is pretty serious. He's 5 feet 11 inches, so about 160cm, not super tall but average. Weight is between 200-224 lbs, which is on the heavier side but not extreme. He hasn't married yet and is alone. No high school diploma or GED, so educationally advanced but limited. He's never worked, so no job history. Used marijuana in past four years, which might indicate some dependency issues. Not depressed at all since he didn't feel depressed over the past month.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided, they range from low to high recidivism outcomes based on different factors. For example, if someone has a history of substance abuse and is alone, that's probably a high risk because they might need support systems or resources. Also, being Black with an educated background could add to recidivism since they might face discrimination.\n\nHis family size is 11, which is large, but it's his own problem. The fact that he's alone and lives in a big household suggests isolation, especially with no kids to provide support for. His lack of employment means no job history, which could mean he had trouble finding work, possibly contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe's been convicted twice, so that's another red flag. If someone is convicted multiple times, they might have substance abuse issues or feel isolated because society often doesn't understand their past mistakes. The fact that he's Black and educated adds to the risk because of the potential for discrimination against him in the job market or after committing a crime.\n\nHe uses marijuana but hasn't shown signs of dependency since he didn't get depressed over the past month. That might indicate that his substance use was temporary, so it's less likely to contribute to recidivism compared to someone who has been using drugs consistently.\n\nPutting this all together: High risk because of multiple convictions, isolation in a big family without kids, lack of employment, being Black and educated, and not showing signs of dependency. The high weight factors are his substance abuse history (two convictions), isolation (household size 11), lack of job history, being Black and educated, and the lack of signs of dependency.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think this person has a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a history of criminal activity that could pose significant risks.\",\n     \"Given the individual's history of being arrested multiple times and possibly contributing to his isolation due to an unlarged-out household, this factor significantly increases his risk level.\"),\n    (\"family size\", \"high\", \"The individual resides in a large household without children, which contributes to his increased vulnerability compared to those with smaller families.\",\n     \"Living alone in a family of 11 means he faces isolation challenges and potential discrimination that could affect recidivism rates.\",\n    (\"lack of job history\", \"medium\", \"The individual's lack of employment history could provide opportunities for education or entry-level work, potentially reducing recidivism risks.\",\n     \"This factor suggests a moderate risk level despite the other factors contributing.\",\n    (\"black identity with educated background\", \"high\", \"His race and educated status may lead to discrimination in the job market, complicating efforts to prevent recidivism.\",\n     \"This factor adds another layer of consideration for potential recidivism risks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
