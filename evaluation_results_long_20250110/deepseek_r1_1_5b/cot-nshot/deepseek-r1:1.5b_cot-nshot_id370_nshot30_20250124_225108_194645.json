    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The task is to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case using given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each component entails. Each risk factor has three possible states: low, medium, or high. We'll evaluate how likely each state is based on provided examples.\n\nLooking at the case details:\n\n1. **Age**: 19 years old.\n2. **Gender**: White.\n3. **Education Level**: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. So, higher education level (more than high school).\n4. **Marital Status**: Currently living alone.\n5. **Housing**: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4.\n6. **Employment**: Worked for two jobs during the year.\n7. **Education Level**: Enrolled in college, which is higher than high school.\n8. **Habits/Commodities**: Used marijuana and cocaine.\n9. **Depression**: Not felt depressed over the past month.\n10. **Age Group**: Young adult (19 years old).\n\nNow, let's analyze each risk factor:\n\n- **High School Diploma vs. College**: The individual has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college, which might indicate higher educational attainment and possibly less reliance on traditional pathways. This could affect recidivism rates.\n  \n- **Living Alone**: The case mentions living with both biological parents in a small household. This is unusual for a young adult, perhaps indicating more independence, which might reduce recidivism.\n\n- **Marital Status**: Currently living alone suggests that the couple is apart from others, possibly reducing family dynamics and increasing individual chances of reoffending.\n\n- **Employment**: Working two jobs could mean better job security and stability. More stable employment can lower recidivism rates because individuals are more likely to stay in their current situation without jeopardizing their lives.\n\n- **Habits/Commodities (Marijuana/Cocaine)**: Using these substances is a significant risk factor. Higher use of such drugs increases the likelihood of recidivism, even if one uses them occasionally.\n\n- **Depression**: Not feeling depressed over the past month could mean stress or other issues affecting mental health. This might impact overall well-being and reoffending rates.\n\nNow, compiling these factors into a risk factor matrix:\n\n1. High School vs. College: Medium\n2. Living Alone: Low (since more independent)\n3. Marital Status: Low\n4. Employment: Medium (two jobs likely provides more stability)\n5. Habits/Commodities: High (marijuana and cocaine are problematic)\n6. Depression: Low (not feeling depressed)\n7. Age Group: Normal\n\nNext, assign weights based on these factors:\n\n- High School vs. College: 3 (Medium)\n- Living Alone: 2 (Low)\n- Marital Status: 1 (Low)\n- Employment: 4 (Medium)\n- Habits/Commodities: 5 (High)\n- Depression: 0 (Low)\n- Age Group: 6 (Normal)\n\nNow, sum the weights:\n\n3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\nTotal possible weight is 6. So average per factor: 2.5. Since higher is better for recidivism prediction, we might need to adjust.\n\nBut wait, in the provided examples, when a factor was high, it generally increased recidivism risk. However, some factors were low or medium and didn't show extreme impact. \n\nGiven that this individual has habits like using marijuana and cocaine, which are significant risks, the overall risk might be weighted towards higher recidivism.\n\nConsidering each factor's weight:\n\n- High (3)\n- Medium (4)\n- Medium (5)\n\nSum: 12\n\nTotal possible is 6 factors, so average per factor: 12/6 = 2. So lower weight could mean higher risk? Or perhaps the individual has multiple high risks.\n\nWait, but looking at other cases:\n\nIn Example #30, he had a conviction for 2 times and was enrolled in college with two jobs. That might have increased recidivism.\n\nBut this case is unique because he's living alone, working two jobs, using substances, not feeling depressed, etc.\n\nGiven that he's involved in multiple high-risk areas (high school vs college, substance use) combined with a normal age group and stable employment, but the key factor here is substance use. This might significantly increase recidivism.\n\nIn previous examples, substance use was one of the highest risk factors, often leading to higher recidivism rates. So this case's substance use (marijuana and cocaine) could be a strong indicator.\n\nThus, despite some other factors being low or medium, the primary high-risk factor is substance use.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"High Recidivism Rate\",\n  \"matrix\": [\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"High School vs. College\",\n      \"weight\": 3,\n      \"probability\": \"Medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Living Alone\",\n      \"weight\": 2,\n      \"probability\": \"Low\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Marital Status\",\n      \"weight\": 1,\n      \"probability\": \"Low\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Employment\",\n      \"weight\": 4,\n      \"probability\": \"Medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Habits/Commodities (Marijuana/Cocaine)\",\n      \"weight\": 5,\n      \"probability\": \"High\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Depression\",\n      \"weight\": 0,\n      \"probability\": \"Low\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"risk_factor\": \"Age Group\",\n      \"weight\": 6,\n      \"probability\": \"Normal\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
