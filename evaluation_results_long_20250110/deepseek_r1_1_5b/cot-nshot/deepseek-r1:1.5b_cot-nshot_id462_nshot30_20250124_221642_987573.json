    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk factors for this case. The person is an 19-year-old male who's White. He hasn't been arrested yet, so that's good, but he has been in a crisis situation before. He's 6'1\" and weighs about 150-174 lbs., which might be lower than average for his age. He's single and lived with his biological mother in a small family of four. That's probably a vulnerable group because it's a low-density area.\n\nHe has two jobs, which is unusual but possible. But the main issue seems to be substance abuse\u2014using marijuana for 2 years, then some time using more recently. That's concerning because substance abuse can be harmful and lead to problems. Also, he feels down when he does too much, which makes me think of social support issues.\n\nSocial isolation might be a factor since he lived with his mother in a small family. Maybe there weren't enough people around him to provide emotional support. High school diploma but not in college means he's somewhat educated but lacks formal credentials related to criminal justice. That could limit opportunities for reentry into the criminal justice system, which is crucial for recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: no arrests yet, low to medium risk factors include substance abuse and possibly some form of mental health issues due to his down trend. But without any convictions or prior arrest history, the recidivism might be moderate but not extremely high. The family size and lack of support might contribute to lower recidivism rates.\n\nSo, I think the prediction would be NO with a confidence around 70% because while he's vulnerable, there are compensating factors like having some jobs and no formal education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"He has been in crisis situations and has used marijuana for over two years.
