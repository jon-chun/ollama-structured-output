    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old male based on his risk factors and some examples given.\n\nFirst, looking at the risk factors provided in the examples, they seem to have specific details that determine how likely someone is to rearrest. The key aspects include age, education level, employment status, number of jobs, substance use history, family background, living situation, and mental health history.\n\nNow, applying this to the case:\n\n- **Age**: 20 years old. Not very old, but also not young.\n- **Education**: High school diploma (GED) and not enrolled in college. So, he's at least somewhat educated.\n- **Employment**: Currently not living alone, holds a job. Worked four jobs during the year, which is significant.\n- **Substance Use**: Medication use in the past four years with no depression issues. That seems to be a good sign.\n- **Family Background**: Lived with his biological mother in a small household (6 people) in an urban area. Family life might play a role.\n- **Mental Health**: No significant depression cases mentioned, so mental health is probably stable.\n\nLooking back at the examples, recidivism outcomes were mostly \"NO\" except for one example where it was \"YES\". The main factors that led to recidivism in other cases included substance abuse and a high number of jobs. In this case, though, he's working four jobs, which seems more stable than some others.\n\nAdditionally, his education level is decent, but since he's not at a very advanced stage, maybe it doesn't make him an easy person to catch. The family being close (household size 6) might give him less opportunities for reoffending due to social isolation. However, the fact that he's employed four times and has substance use history without signs of depression is encouraging.\n\nHe's also living in a medium-sized area, which could mean more opportunities or less control over his behavior. But since he's not married (indicated by being single) and lives with his biological mother in a small household, maybe he's considered \"sufficiently\" stable emotionally and in social circles, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nConsidering all the factors: high number of jobs, substance use without mental health issues, living situation, education level. It seems less likely to rearrest than some others but more than most. So, I'd lean towards a moderate outcome, probably \"NO\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employed in four jobs during the year\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"He has significant employment history and multiple jobs, indicating a stable work environment which may make him less prone to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Has been arrested 1 time but not convicted\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"While he's at risk due to past convictions, the absence of recent ones in four years suggests improved mental health and social support over time.\")\n    ,(\"Has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"His education level shows potential but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism without other factors like substance use and mental health.)\n    ,(\"Lived in family of six, medium-sized household\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"A moderate size family might offer more opportunities or less control over behavior compared to larger households.\")\n    ,(\"Has never felt depressed in the past month\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"His lack of mental health issues is a positive sign, suggesting he can avoid self-criticism and depression.)\n    ,(\"Is an 18-year-old male with no significant mental health issues\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"This age group might have varied recidivism rates based on other factors like substance use, family dynamics, etc.\")\n    ,(\"Responsible for four jobs during the year and has been in a household of six\", \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\", \"He's worked hard but not necessarily at an advanced level, which could affect his recidivism chances.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
