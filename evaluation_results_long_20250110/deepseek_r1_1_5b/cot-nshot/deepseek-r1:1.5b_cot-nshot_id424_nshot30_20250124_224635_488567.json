    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the recidivism rate for this 19-year-old female case. Let me break down each risk factor step by step based on the provided examples and my own reasoning.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. In general, younger people tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might spend more time in prison or face more opportunities for rehabilitation. So I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nNext, she's a White person without a high school diploma or GED, which are significant factors. Lack of education and no diploma can make someone less likely to complete their education later on, contributing to recidivism. That's a high risk factor. Medium weight.\n\nShe has two jobs, which could mean more opportunities for employment during prison or better job prospects post-criminal. But wait, the example I looked at earlier had her living with her biological mother in an urban area, involved in multiple drug use (marijuana and cocaine), and not feeling depressed. The prediction was NO recidivism. Hmm, so maybe she's mostly clean? Or perhaps the context of her drug use led to success?\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a small household of 3 in an urban area. This is a low living condition, which might make her more likely to reenter into society and commit crimes. So that would be a high risk factor.\n\nShe didn't get caught four times but was cleared each time. That's confusing because if she was never arrested, how did she get out? Maybe she was clean or the system didn't catch her. Alternatively, perhaps there were multiple instances of drug use without being convicted. But according to the example with a similar case, this situation led to no recidivism. So I'll assign medium weight.\n\nShe used both marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which are potent substances that can lead to violent crimes or addiction issues. That's a high risk factor. Medium weight.\n\nHer living conditions being poor (small family in an urban area) might increase recidivism as they may lead to more stress or isolation after release. High weight here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is good because depression can contribute to recidivism. So I'll give her a low weight factor for mental health.\n\nPutting it all together: she's high risk due to lack of education, poor living conditions, substance use, and family size. But in the examples, those factors didn't lead to recidivism. So maybe her lack of education and substance use are mitigated by the positive outcome. Therefore, I'll assign low weights to most factors, but perhaps give a medium weight to those that directly contribute.\n\nWait, looking back at the previous example where she had a similar situation: she lived in a small, urban household with multiple drug users, which increased recidivism risk. But in that case, no recidivism was predicted because of the context leading her to succeed. So maybe in this case, despite some high-risk factors, the specific circumstances made it better than expected.\n\nAlternatively, if most high-risk factors were mitigated by positive outcomes, then the overall risk might be lower than previously thought. But without more detailed data on each factor's impact, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI'll assign a low weight to education and no diploma, medium to substance use, and high to living conditions. That leaves recidivism as a possible low, but considering her positive outcome from the examples, maybe it's actually better than expected.\n\nSo overall, I'll predict NO recidivism with a medium confidence level because most of the risk factors were mitigated by the case's context leading to success.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High school diploma status\", \"low\", \"She lacks education and no GED, which may hinder her recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family size\", \"high\", \"Small family in an urban area increases living conditions for release and potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"Lack of substance use history (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"medium\", \"Heavy substance use can contribute to recidivism despite positive outcomes from context\"),\n    (\"Living conditions\", \"low\", \"Poor living conditions increase recidivism risk due to stress and isolation after release\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
