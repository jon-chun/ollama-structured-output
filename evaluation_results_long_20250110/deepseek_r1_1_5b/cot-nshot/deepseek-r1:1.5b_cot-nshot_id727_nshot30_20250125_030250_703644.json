    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old male case. Let me start by understanding the given information and the examples provided.\n\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who's White. He's lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area, which probably increases his living conditions and might affect recidivism. He has two jobs during the year, which is good because more employment reduces risk. He didn't get high school diploma or GED, so education is another factor to consider. He's lived alone for some time, which could be a risk if he was away from kids.\n\nLooking at the examples, especially those with similar factors, it seems that living in a stable household (household size 5) and having two jobs are positive signs. Recidivism rates tend to go down when people have stable lives and work more. The fact that he's been arrested once but not convicted suggests he hasn't completely dropped out, which is reassuring.\n\nThe factors like living alone for some time might increase recidivism because it puts him at higher risk of being away from others. However, this person has two jobs, so maybe the risk is mitigated a bit. The fact that he's been arrested once but not convicted and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed over the past month shows he's on a positive trajectory.\n\nIn the examples where factors were positive (like having two jobs, stable household), outcomes were more likely to be negative (re-arrest). But when factors like living alone increased risk, outcomes were lower. So, in this case, despite some uncertainty about living conditions, his recent history of not reciditing and being in a stable household points towards a low recidivism outcome.\n\nI think the overall probability is on the lower side because while he's lived alone for a bit, his other factors are good. The recidivism rate might be moderate but not high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lived_alone\", \"low\", \"This limited living situation increases risk of re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"two_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs reduce individual risk compared to a single job and stable environment.\"),\n    (\"family_size_5\", \"medium\", \"Stable household with two jobs reduces the likelihood of recidivism in urban areas.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
