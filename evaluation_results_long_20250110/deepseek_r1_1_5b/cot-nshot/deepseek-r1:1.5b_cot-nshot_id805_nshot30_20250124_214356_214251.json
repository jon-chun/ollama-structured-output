    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk factors for this case. Let's see... The person is a 22-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which sounds really serious. His weight is 170 lbs, not too big, but he's married (since he says \"married\" in the examples), so that might be a risk factor because being married can lead to issues like living with parents or friends who might be worried about his reoffending.\n\nHe's never been married, which I guess is good, but maybe that adds some stress. He's got a high school diploma and is in college now (4 years), so education level isn't the highest. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years except the last month, where he felt down. That must be a red flag because drug use can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHis household size is 5\u2014lived with both biological parents and maybe a couple of other family members. This probably adds some stress or uncertainty about his situation. He's currently living alone, which might make him more vulnerable if he gets caught. His weight isn't too low, so maybe not the biggest issue but still something to watch out for.\n\nHe's been in 4 jobs during the year\u2014maybe he worked part-time or in different roles. This could mean he's involved with someone who has a history of reoffending. The last month, he felt down and didn't feel good about it, which is concerning because stress can make people less motivated to commit again.\n\nHis age is 22, not the oldest in examples, but maybe that's normal unless there are specific risks associated with older adults. His height isn't an issue here. His weight being under his head might be okay if he's healthy.\n\nLooking at the risk factors from examples, things like marital status, drug use, living alone, and being caught multiple times seem crucial. He's married, which is a significant risk factor because being with family or friends can cause stress and make it harder to reoffend. His past convictions are a clear red flag\u2014more than just getting into trouble once; it keeps coming back.\n\nThe fact that he's in college could also be a concern because having a higher degree might increase opportunities for recidivism, but the examples didn't have someone in college with a high risk factor. However, his education level is important because higher education often comes with more stress and responsibilities, which can contribute to reoffending.\n\nHis household size being 5\u2014lived with parents and maybe some others\u2014could add uncertainty or stress if he's left without them. Living alone might make him more vulnerable, especially if someone else is in the house who's a problem. The weight of his past convictions makes me think he's part of a criminal network or has a history that's hard to break.\n\nThe fact that he felt down last month and didn't feel good about it could be a significant stressor because feeling depressed can lead to substance use or other behaviors that increase recidivism rates. His age being 22 is within the general population, so unless there are specific risks associated with that age group for reoffending, he might not have an especially high risk.\n\nConsidering all this, I think his marital status and past convictions are the primary risk factors contributing to his higher recidivism risk. These factors place him in a position where it's more likely he'll be involved again.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Married\", \"high\", \"Being married adds stress and uncertainty, potentially increasing reoffending risks\"),\n    (\"Past Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior that could lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living with Parents or Co-Parents\", \"medium\", \"Lived alone could increase vulnerability if someone is a problem\"),\n    (\"Married and in College\", \"medium\", \"College life might add stress and responsibilities that contribute to reoffending\"),\n    (\"Weight 170 lbs, Not the Highest\", \"low\", \"His weight isn't an issue but not the highest\"),\n    (\"Not Marital Status or Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Education level is considered but not the primary risk factor here\"),\n    (\"Household Size 5, Lived with Parents and Others\", \"medium\", \"Uncertainty from living with others could enhance reoffending risks\"),\n    (\"Thoughts About Stress and Feel of Down, Time Feeling Down in Last Month, Not Great About It\"), \"low\" or \"medium\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
