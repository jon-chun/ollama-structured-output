    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a detailed scenario about an 19-year-old Black male who's been arrested but not convicted. He's from a rural area, married, and hasn't had much work. He's on a GED and not enrolled in college. He used marijuana in the past four years, especially during the last month when he felt down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor given by the user. The key points are his age, race, education level, household size, marital status, work history, drug use history, living situation, and beliefs about God.\n\nStarting with race: Black people can face more serious legal issues due to systemic racism, but this individual hasn't been convicted, so that's a plus. His background isn't mentioned, which is another variable.\n\nHis education level: He has a GED but not enrolled in college. This might indicate some skill or knowledge, but it could also be a vulnerability if he's underfunded for higher education. Still, given his age and arrest history, maybe that's manageable.\n\nMarriage status: He's married, which is common, but if he's never had children, that could affect his life and relationships. But without specific details, I can't assess this as much.\n\nHousehold size of 5 in a rural area suggests a smaller community with possible limited resources or opportunities for criminal activity. This might influence his legal situation compared to someone from a larger area.\n\nNo work history: He hasn't done much, but that doesn't mean he's not at risk. Many people face similar issues without prior convictions.\n\nDrug use history: He's been using marijuana in the past four years and has a history of feeling down. Marijuana is often linked to mental health issues, which could be a red flag.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a small household might provide some security but also open doors for criminal activities in rural areas. Rural settings can sometimes foster crime if there's a lack of community control or law enforcement presence.\n\nNot enrolled in college: If he has limited resources to attend college, it could affect his ability to secure higher education opportunities later on, which is part of the risk assessment.\n\nHis living situation being rural and perhaps less established for criminal activity compared to urban areas might be a factor. However, without specific details, I can't weigh this as much.\n\nBeliefs about God: If he believes in God, that could influence his legal choices but doesn't necessarily increase his legal risks unless it affects his decision-making or trust in law enforcement.\n\nConsidering all these factors, some are significant and indicate potential risk (YES), while others aren't as critical. However, given the arrest without conviction, that's a notable red flag. The lack of education could also be an issue if he needs higher skills for a criminal career, but it might not directly tie to his current situation. The drug history is concerning due to its potential mental health impact and the possibility of criminal activity in rural areas. The rural living environment adds another layer, but without specifics, it's challenging to assess. His lack of college enrollment could affect future opportunities, which is a risk factor. Overall, several factors point towards high risk, so the prediction should be YES with an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
