    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. The user is asking about the risk assessment for a young female who's arrested once and convicted. She's white, 20 years old, 5'4\" tall, weighs 110 lbs. She's never married but living alone now. She has a high school diploma in college. She's lived with her biological parents in a small household of four in rural area for two kids. No substance abuse issues or feelings of depression over the past month. At a young age, she considered God not involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor and determine if they indicate high risk. The person is 20, which might put her at higher risk due to legal maturity. She's arrested once, so that's one potential issue. No substance abuse or depression, but living alone could be a concern as she may not have had support.\n\nShe's rural, which could affect community involvement. Living with parents in small family homes is less common and could increase risks. She has children too, which might require more attention. The absence of substance use issues might reduce anxiety about mental health or criminal behavior.\n\nHigh school diploma might indicate potential, but without college credit earned elsewhere, it's a bit uncertain. College enrollment adds another layer. Also, living alone in rural areas could lead to isolation and more serious crime risks. Since she never used drugs, that reduces the concern of addiction risk. No depression suggests less stress from mental health issues.\n\nPutting this together, her legal maturity (20) puts some at higher risk, coupled with living alone and rural setting likely increasing risks. The absence of substance abuse points to lower anxiety about that factor. College enrollment adds another layer but doesn't necessarily make the person riskier if she's otherwise okay.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}",
