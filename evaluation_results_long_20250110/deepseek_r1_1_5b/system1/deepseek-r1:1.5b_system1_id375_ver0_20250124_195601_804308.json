    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. The user provided a detailed scenario where I need to assess risk based on various factors. They asked for a JSON object with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor one by one. The person is a 21-year-old male, White, arrested three times and convicted. He's 5'11\" and weighs 135 lbs. Never married, living alone now. No high school diploma or GED, not in college. Holds three jobs, used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years, didn't feel depressed over the last month. Young age, lived with biological mom in a 2-person household in an urban area. God influences his personal life.\n\nI need to determine if these factors indicate high risk. Let's break them down:\n\n1. Age: 21 is young, not too old for criminal activities.\n2. Identity: White background doesn't inherently increase risk; race isn't a factor here.\n3. Arrest history and convictions: Three arrests in four years suggest past behavior that could be linked to future actions.\n4. Physical attributes: He's 5'11\" (slim) and 135 lbs, average for his age, no cause of concern.\n5. No education: Without a high school diploma or GED, less likely to have criminal skills, but it's not absolute.\n6. Not in college: Similarly, less likely to engage in higher-level crimes without immediate evidence.\n7. Job history: Three jobs don't indicate dangerous patterns unless there are specific issues like substance abuse.\n8. Drug use: He used marijuana in past four years. Using substances is a risk factor for criminal behavior.\n9. Depression: No feelings of depression over the last month, which is concerning. Depression can be linked to criminal behavior, especially if substance abuse is involved.\n10. Home environment: Lived with biological mom in urban area, maybe higher than average living conditions but still not extreme.\n\nLooking at these points, drug use and depression are significant factors. Depression could lead to substance abuse or future criminal activities. Since he's a 21-year-old with no prior delinquency information, his risk is somewhat high. But it's also possible to be protective if he doesn't commit any crimes yet.\n\nConsidering all the factors, I think the prediction should be YES but with some uncertainty because depression isn't mentioned directly, though its presence in drug use could lead to criminal behavior. The confidence level would be moderate since while there are risk factors, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
