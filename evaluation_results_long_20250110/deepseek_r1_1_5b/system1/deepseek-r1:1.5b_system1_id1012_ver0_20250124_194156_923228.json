    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for the individual described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 21 years old. That's within legal age in many places, but being a minor doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless there are specific circumstances.\n\n2. **Gender and Identification**: Being Black might indicate some background issues, but it doesn't directly translate to criminal risk without additional context.\n\n3. **Arrest and Conviction History**: One arrest and two convictions could be concerning, especially if they relate to drug-related crimes, which is a known issue for minors, though not always indicated by age alone.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes**: Being 5'6\" and weighing between 150-174 lbs doesn't raise red flags. These are more about physical build than criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Not married could be a factor if there were issues with relationships, but without specific evidence of past crimes or drug use during that period, it's not clear.\n\n6. **Education and Employment**: No high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. That suggests limited education background, which is a red flag for criminal behavior unless there are specific circumstances making education relevant to crime prevention.\n\n7. **Job History**: Not involved in any jobs during the year suggests no prior criminal activity due to lack of experience.\n\n8. **Drug Use and Emotional State**: Using drugs (cocaine and marijuana) in past four years, especially when feeling down, could indicate an underlying issue that might contribute to criminal behavior. The emotional state being particularly affected is concerning.\n\n9. **God's Role**: While this is a common belief for many, it doesn't directly translate into criminal risk unless there are specific circumstances or evidence linking divine influence to past crimes, which isn't provided here.\n\n10. **Living Situation and Background**: Living alone in an urban area with a biological mother from a household of four could place the individual at high-risk if they've had prior experiences with criminal behavior. However, without specific details about such past actions or issues related to criminal prevention, this remains speculative.\n\n**Conclusion**: Considering all factors, especially drug use and emotional impact, along with living in an urban area where criminal behavior is more likely, the risk factor is present and significant.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
