    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me start by reading through each factor carefully.\n\nThe person is 19, male, White. He's been arrested twice but not convicted. That\u2019s interesting because if someone gets two tickets, they\u2019re in trouble, which could be a red flag for serious issues. He's 6'1\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Not too tall or too short, so that might not indicate immediate danger.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. That\u2019s unusual because being single can lead to stress, especially with a criminal history. But I'm not sure if living alone necessarily increases his risk beyond just other factors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn\u2019t in college. That could mean he might be struggling academically or couldn\u2019t attend school for some reason. This could be a concern but maybe not directly related to the arrest.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in a 4-person household, which is quite large. That seems intense because having multiple people around you can create stress and anxiety, especially if there\u2019s an ongoing criminal history.\n\nHe\u2019s used marijuana in the past four years and has had some down feelings in the dumps for the last month. That\u2019s concerning because using drugs like marijuana can lead to drug-induced issues, which might make someone feel unwell or depressed, increasing their risk of harm.\n\nHis genetic background isn\u2019t mentioned, but being 19 is also a young age, so genetics could play a role in certain developmental issues later on.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest history and the recent down feeling are significant. The stress from living alone, the ongoing marital situation, and drug use create a lot of potential for harm or mental health issues that could make him more vulnerable to being arrested again.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
