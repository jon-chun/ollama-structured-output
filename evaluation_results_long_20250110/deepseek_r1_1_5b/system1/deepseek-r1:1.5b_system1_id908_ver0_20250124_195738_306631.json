    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for someone who's being arrested. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. That might raise some concerns because Black people are often associated with certain issues like racism, discrimination, or mental health challenges. But since he's just an 18, it's still a relatively young age, and that's usually seen as safer.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. While arrest is a red flag, not being convicted doesn't necessarily mean high risk. It could be that the individual isn't fully committed or is struggling with mental health issues, which might lead them to eventually get convicted in the future.\n\nHis height and weight aren't concerning on their own\u20145 feet 6 inches is average for his age, and 178 lbs seems about right for an adult male. So this factor doesn't look high risk.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone. Being single might be a concern regarding financial stability, relationships, or mental health.Living alone could lead to issues like isolation, which might affect criminal behavior in the long run. That does sound like a high risk factor.\n\nHis family size is 4, including his biological mother. A household of four can be challenging because of potential conflicts and strained relationships. Living alone adds another layer of stress. This seems significant enough to consider high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. High school doesn't automatically make someone prone to criminal behavior, especially if they're not committed. But he's still at least 18, which is generally safer than someone who hasn't started school yet.\n\nHe's been using marijuana for the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using drugs can lead to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. Not feeling depressed might be a symptom of those issues, but it could also indicate a lack of support system. However, not being fully committed is still a red flag.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This seems too broad and doesn't provide specific concerns about criminal behavior or mental health. It's more philosophical and might not directly impact the risk level.\n\nPutting this all together, he's an 18-year-old, which is somewhat young, but he's single, living alone in a family of four, having used drugs for four years, not feeling depressed over the past month, and considering God's influence. All these factors point towards him being at higher risk than average for someone arrested.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
