    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male who's been arrested and convicted. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White person, which is positive. That might indicate a certain level of stability or acceptance. But I'm not sure if that's enough on its own.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall, which isn't the tallest, but it doesn't necessarily mean high risk. Maybe he has some strength, which could be an asset in a job or community work role.\n\nHe weighs 155 lbs. That seems reasonable for his age; usually, young adults are around that weight, so no immediate cause of concern.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That's a big deal because people often expect them to have children, especially at this age. living alone could lead to issues like isolation or dependency, which might contribute to higher risk factors later on.\n\nHis education: No high school diploma or GED. That means he didn't go through formal schooling, which can be a barrier in many places. This might delay his ability to work and get into jobs that require education, increasing his risk of getting arrested again or conviction if not caught early.\n\nHe's been involved in 1 job during the year. So maybe he's had some prior experience working, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's high on risk factors. It could be a stepping stone to bigger issues later.\n\nHe's used drugs for the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. That sounds concerning because drug use is a serious issue. Even though it's illegal, drug abuse or dependence can lead to criminal behavior, which would increase his risk of being arrested again.\n\nBut wait, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That might be an exception where someone doesn't have extreme feelings about their health but still struggles with mental health. It could make him appear more stable, but I'm not sure if that's enough to warrant a high risk assessment.\n\nHis family background: lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, which isn't the largest, and is in an urban area. This might mean he has some social isolation, which can be bad because it affects his mental health and job opportunities. Living alone could make him feel isolated too.\n\nGod's role: The person considers that God has something to do with their life personally. That's interesting but not directly evidence of a criminal background. It might indicate personal commitment or spirituality, which is positive, but not necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while he's been arrested and convicted, his family background issues, lack of education, drug use, living alone in an urban area, and possibly feeling isolated are significant contributors to higher risk factors. These points make me lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
