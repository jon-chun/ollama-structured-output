    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a detailed scenario and asked me to assess the risk based on specific factors. I need to evaluate each element carefully.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old, which makes her a potential adult for criminal activities. She identifies as White, which is a common demographic but doesn't inherently indicate a high-risk behavior.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests she might have some substance abuse history since she used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. The recent down feeling could be linked to her substance use patterns.\n\nHer lifestyle includes being single, living alone, enrolled in school, having 3 jobs, and holding a previous job. This isn't inherently risky as long as they don't engage in criminal activities or commit delusions.\n\nThe household size is small (4 people) and she lived with her biological father there. The context doesn't provide any immediate indicators of criminal behavior, especially since the drug use history is clear from past data.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal struggles but this is more about personal beliefs rather than substance use or criminal intent. No specific risk factors are mentioned that point towards higher crime likelihood.\n\nOverall, while there's a noted drug history and past substance abuse, no other factors directly suggest high-risk behavior. Therefore, I'll classify her as NO with an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year.
