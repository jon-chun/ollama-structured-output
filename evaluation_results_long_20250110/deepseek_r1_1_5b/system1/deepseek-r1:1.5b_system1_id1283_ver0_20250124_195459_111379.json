    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a detailed scenario and wants me to act as an expert risk assessment model. They've given specific risk factors for someone who's a 20-year-old Black male arrested eight times, has no college education, uses drugs, and is living alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor one by one. The person identifies as Black but doesn't mention any race-related issues beyond that. He's arrested multiple times without any particular justification, which could be concerning. The age of 20 might affect legal experience since young people sometimes have less criminal history, but it's still a potential risk.\n\nThe household size is small (3), and he lived with his biological mother there. This living situation is unusual for someone with an arrest record, possibly due to neglect or stress. Living alone without any support system would be a significant concern. The fact that he uses marijuana suggests dependence, which can lead to health issues like depression.\n\nHis GED doesn't add much since he's 20 and hasn't started college yet. His education level is low but still functional. Not being enrolled in college might mean his criminal record isn't tied directly to any formal education, but it could still pose a risk if there are patterns over time or specific factors that change.\n\nHe hasn't used college credit, so any past history isn't linked to education. This makes the risk factor less relevant compared to other areas like substance use or living alone. The stress from his current situation, combined with substance abuse and living alone, could lead to mental health challenges like depression.\n\nThe user has a history of substance abuse in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is concerning because substance use can significantly impact mental health. Living alone without support might contribute to feelings of isolation, adding another layer of stress.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014the arrest record, lack of education, substance use, living alone, neglect, and potential stress\u2014it seems highly likely that this person would have high criminal justice risk. The user's circumstances are unique and could lead to serious consequences if not handled properly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
