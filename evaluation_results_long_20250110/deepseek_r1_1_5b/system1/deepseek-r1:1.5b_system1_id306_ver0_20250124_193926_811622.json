    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. That seems neutral, but it's good to know her gender and racial identity might influence how things are perceived.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That\u2019s interesting because usually, an arrest doesn\u2019t lead to conviction unless there's some kind of special situation or the law is applied differently. I'm not sure about that here though.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight is 127 lbs. That seems a bit short for her age, but she\u2019s a high school graduate, so maybe it's normal. Her past behavior includes using drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and not feeling depressed over the past month. She hasn\u2019t been convicted yet, which is odd because she\u2019s been using drugs.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school at the present moment, which might mean she's studying or taking classes, but since she's a minor, that could be unusual. She has held one job during the year, and she's living alone now. That makes me think about her independence and how it affects her behavior.\n\nShe\u2019s from a household of size 5 with her biological parents, which might mean they're supportive or have good relationships. She considers God not to have anything to do with her personal life, so maybe she has some religious beliefs that influence her actions. \n\nPutting all these together: being a minor in college, having used drugs, living alone, and considering God, could indicate a problematic behavior pattern. Even though she's just 19, using substances is concerning, especially if she hasn't been convicted yet. The lack of conviction and drug use might be enough to assess high risk. Plus, her religious views could complicate things further.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
