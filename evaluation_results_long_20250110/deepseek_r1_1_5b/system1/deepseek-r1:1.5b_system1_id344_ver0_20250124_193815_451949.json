    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk factors for this individual. Let's start by going through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That seems neutral enough at first glance, but considering she's just started college and hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that's a point of concern. She has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so her education level is limited. However, she still works part-time at a job where she can get paid, which might indicate some work experience.\n\nShe's 5 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs. That doesn't seem too bad for her age. Her family size is five, but since she lived with both biological parents in a rural area, I wonder if that affects her well-being or mental health. It's important to consider the environment around her.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted of anything, which might raise questions about whether her past experiences are affecting her current decisions. The drug use information is also significant\u2014she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down sometimes. That could indicate a history of negative emotions or stress, which might weigh on her decision-making.\n\nShe's currently single, which means she doesn't have a partner to fall back on, but that alone isn't necessarily bad. However, living alone can be stressful, especially if it affects mental health. The mention of God having something to do with her life adds an interesting perspective, but without more context, it's hard to assess its impact.\n\nHer family background is rural and part of a small household, which might mean there are fewer people around for support and community bonds that could affect her well-being. The fact that she started college early suggests she might have less time for personal growth compared to others who attend school full-time or live in larger households.\n\nI'm considering whether all these factors together indicate high risk. On one hand, the lack of conviction, drug use, and being single are significant negative indicators. However, her education level is limited and she's part of a small family might provide some buffer against stress. She has work experience that could give her a better head start on decisions compared to someone without any relevant jobs.\n\nI'm also thinking about how her background compares to others in the same age group. Some may have more exposure to stressors, while others live with larger families or attend school full-time. Her situation might place her at the lower end of risk but not necessarily a 100% low risk because she has some work experience that could mitigate past negative outcomes.\n\nOverall, I think this individual doesn't seem like a high-risk person based on the information given, but it's not entirely without any warnings either. The combination of factors makes her at risk, but not in severe enough ways to warrant immediate action.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": \"60\"\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 9 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
