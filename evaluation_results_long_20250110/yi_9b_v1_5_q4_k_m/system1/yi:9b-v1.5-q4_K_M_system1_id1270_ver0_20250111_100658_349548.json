    "raw_message_text": "\nThe risk factors are:\n1. Age: The person is 21 years old, which is within the range considered high-risk (typically between 18 and 30).\n2. Gender: Male. This is not a significant factor in this context as it does not directly contribute to high-risk behavior.\n3. Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic. While race/ethnicity can be a risk factor, the lack of specific information about the person's background makes it difficult to assess whether they are at higher risk compared to others.\n4. Arrest Record: The person has been arrested once and convicted. This is an indicator of involvement in criminal activities and increases the risk level.\n5. Physical Characteristics: Height (6 feet 1 inch), weight (240 lbs). While these characteristics may not directly relate to high-risk behavior, they are not considered significant factors for this analysis.\n6. Marital Status: Single and living alone. This can indicate a lack of support system or social connections, which could potentially increase the risk level.\n7. Education Level: No high school diploma or GED certificate. Lack of formal education may limit opportunities and contribute to increased vulnerability.\n8. Employment History: Has not held any jobs during the year. This suggests limited employment stability or lack of work experience, both of which could be associated with higher risk.\n9. Substance Use: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n10. Mental Health: No depression over the past month. While this may not directly contribute to high-risk behavior, it doesn't rule out potential issues that could affect decision-making.\n11. Early Environment: Lived with biological mother in household of size 4, urban area. This environment does not provide a clear indication of increased risk.\n12. Spiritual Beliefs: God plays an important role in personal life. Religious beliefs can be protective factors for some individuals but cannot be universally assumed to reduce risk levels.\n\nBased on these factors and the provided information, it is reasonable to predict that this individual may have a high-risk profile. However, without more specific details or context about their current situation and potential intervention measures, the confidence in this prediction would be limited. If additional data were available, such as recent behaviors or involvement in support services, the risk assessment could be further refined.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
