The individual is young, has no prior convictions despite one arrest, and has not used drugs or experienced depression in the past year. His educational background (GED) suggests he may have faced some challenges, but his employment history is stable with two jobs held within a year. He lives alone, which could indicate some level of independence and responsibility. The lack of family support (living in a household of only 2 at a young age) and religious belief might contribute to higher risk in other contexts, but given the absence of other significant risk factors here, they do not lead to a high-risk prediction. Therefore, the confidence level is moderately low.",
