The individual is young, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates. His ethnicity and gender do not inherently predict higher risk. Having been arrested twice and convicted suggests some criminal behavior, but without information on the nature of these offenses or severity, it's difficult to assess high risk. He has stable employment history, indicating responsibility and potential integration into society. His drug use is limited to marijuana and doesn't indicate a severe substance abuse problem. Living alone suggests independence but also lack of strong community ties or support systems that could deter criminal behavior. He has completed high school education, indicating some level of social integration and potential for employment opportunities. His religious belief may provide a positive influence on his life decisions. However, the absence of more serious risk factors leads to a lower confidence in this prediction.",
