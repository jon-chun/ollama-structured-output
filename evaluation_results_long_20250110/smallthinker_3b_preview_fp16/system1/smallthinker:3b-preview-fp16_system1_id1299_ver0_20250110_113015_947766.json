    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for the individual in question. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. This is a significant factor, as it suggests she may have a pattern of engaging in behavior that could lead to further arrests or convictions. Wait, let me consider how this might impact her risk level... Given her multiple arrests and convictions, it seems likely that she has a higher propensity for criminal activity.\n\nNext, I'll look at her personal circumstances. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 130 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to her risk level. However, the fact that she has never been married and is currently living alone could indicate some level of instability or lack of social support. Let me think about how this might affect her risk assessment... While it's not directly related to criminal behavior, it could potentially contribute to a higher overall risk score if we consider other factors.\n\nNow, let's examine her educational background. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests she may be at a disadvantage academically and socially compared to those with more education. Hmm, how might this impact her risk level? A lower level of education could potentially limit her job prospects and social mobility, which might increase her vulnerability to certain types of risks.\n\nIn terms of employment, she has held 2 jobs during the year, which is relatively low compared to others. This could indicate some instability in her work life, but it's not immediately clear how this affects her risk level. Let me consider this further... While having multiple jobs can sometimes be a sign of resilience or adaptability, it doesn't necessarily suggest high risk behavior.\n\nRegarding substance use, she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that her drug use is relatively low-level and does not seem to be driving any major negative outcomes. Wait a minute... While this is a positive sign, it's essential to consider that substance use can still contribute to risk factors if it's part of a larger pattern or if it's being used as a coping mechanism for other issues.\n\nHer personal beliefs are also noteworthy. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, which could indicate some level of spirituality or moral compass. Let me think about how this might impact her risk assessment... While spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a framework for positive behavior, they don't necessarily suggest high risk.\n\nFinally, considering her background, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area at a young age. This suggests that she may have experienced some level of instability or trauma in her early life. Hmm, how might this affect her overall risk score? A history of childhood adversity can be a significant factor in predicting future risk, as it may contribute to behavioral and emotional issues.\n\nAfter carefully weighing all these factors, I realize that the combination of her multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, relatively low employment prospects, and potentially unstable upbringing do suggest a higher level of risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... Given the significant number of risk factors present, particularly in terms of criminal history, personal instability, and limited social support, it seems likely that she would be classified as high risk.\n\nTherefore, based on this detailed analysis, I conclude that the risk factors indicate high risk. My confidence in this assessment is 85%, reflecting a careful consideration of all relevant factors.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
