She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
