    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to assess for a 21-year-old white male. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 21, which is young, but not necessarily a red flag on its own. Males in their early twenties can be at higher risk for certain behaviors, but it really depends on the context.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting. An arrest without conviction could suggest either that the charge was unfounded or that he was found not guilty. Either way, it doesn't indicate a criminal record, which is positive.\n\nHis height and weight seem average for his age, so nothing standing out there.\n\nNever been married and not living alone. That's typical for someone his age, so no concerns there.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a protective factor against high-risk behaviors. So that's positive.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. That seems like a lot of job turnover, which could be a risk factor. Instability in employment can sometimes indicate difficulty maintaining consistent work, which might correlate with other risky behaviors.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is great. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for many negative outcomes, so his abstinence from drugs is a strong positive.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is also good. Mental health issues can be correlated with higher risk behaviors, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nLooking back to his childhood, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is often considered ideal, but single-parent households are common and don't necessarily indicate risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but again, it's not definitive.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with personal events, which could indicate a sense of morality or guidance that might protect against risky behaviors.\n\nOverall, most of these factors seem positive or neutral. The only potential red flags are the job turnover and the arrest history, but since there's no conviction, and he's enrolled in college, I would lean towards low risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with a confidence level of, say, 85%.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
