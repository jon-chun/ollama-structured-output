    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess. Let's see what I'm working with here. So, the individual is a 21-year-old white male, arrested once and convicted. He's about average height and weight for his age, I think. Lives alone, never been married, has a high school diploma, worked one job in the past year, no drug use in four years, no recent depression, grew up in a large household with his bio mom, and he believes God plays a role in personal events.\n\nFirst off, age is a big factor. Twenty-one is still pretty young. Sometimes youth correlates with higher risk because of impulsivity and lack of life experience. But everyone matures differently, so I have to consider other factors too.\n\nBeing male also tends to be associated with higher criminality rates, statistically speaking. But again, that's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which is a mark against him. But it's only once, and I don't know the severity of the conviction. Maybe it was a minor offense. Still, any criminal history can indicate some level of risk.\n\nHis educational background: high school diploma, not in college. Education levels can correlate with recidivism rates, but it's not the whole story. Some people excel without higher education, while others may struggle.\n\nLives alone, never married. Living situation can be a factor; stable living arrangements sometimes indicate lower risk. But living alone could go either way\u2014it might mean more freedom to engage in risky behaviors, or it could mean independence and self-sufficiency.\n\nJob history: only one job in the past year. That could suggest stability if he's held that job consistently, or instability if he's had trouble keeping jobs in the past.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive. Substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior, so abstinence from drugs is a good sign.\n\nNo recent depression is also favorable. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to problematic behaviors, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with bio mom in a large household. Household size and structure can influence development, but it's complex. Growing up in a larger family could mean more social interaction but also potentially less individual attention.\n\nBelief in God's influence on personal events might indicate a sense of morality or guidance, which some studies suggest can reduce criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, there are mixed factors here. The criminal history is a red flag, but many other aspects suggest stability and low risk. I need to weigh these carefully.\n\nGiven all this, my prediction is that he's not high risk. The absence of multiple arrests, no recent drug use or mental health issues, and relatively stable employment and living situation lean towards lower risk. But I can't be entirely certain, so I'll rate my confidence at 75%.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\nTo present the analysis in a structured format, here is the JSON object based on the assessment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
