    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this case to assess risk based on these factors. First off, the person is a 22-year-old white male. Age is pretty young, but in criminal justice terms, twenties can still be a high-risk period. Race might have some implications statistically, but it's important not to overemphasize that.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has convictions. That's a significant number. Frequent interactions with the law suggest a pattern of behavior that could indicate higher risk. The fact that these arrests led to convictions means there's a track record of unlawful activities.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 154 lbs. Physically, nothing standing out here in terms of risk factors. It's average, so probably not relevant unless there's something specific about his build or health that relates to the offenses.\n\nLives alone, never been married. Living situation can be a factor; solitary living might sometimes correlate with certain risks, but it's not definitive. Marital status isn't typically a strong predictor on its own.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to employment opportunities and can be a risk factor. Limited education may lead to fewer legitimate earning prospects, potentially increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nEmployment: Held two jobs in the past year. That seems positive in terms of work ethic and responsibility. However, it could also suggest financial pressures or instability if he needs multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in the past four years, and recent depressive feelings. Substance use is a significant risk factor, especially when combined with mental health issues like depression. The combination can exacerbate problematic behaviors.\n\nBackground: Lived with biological mother in an urban area, household size five. Family structure and environment can influence development and potential for engaging in crime. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could expose him to more criminal activity.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God has personal impact. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective factors, but it depends on how they influence his behavior and decision-making.\n\nOverall, the convictions and frequent arrests are major red flags. The lack of education and stable employment are additional concerns. The drug use and recent depressive symptoms are also significant, as they can contribute to risky behaviors. However, the employment history shows some responsibility, which is a positive note.\n\nBalancing all these factors, I would predict high risk. The confidence level is fairly high, given the multiple convictions and the presence of substance use and mental health issues.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
