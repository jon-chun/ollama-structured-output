    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this profile to assess for risk. The person is a 22-year-old white male, arrested twice and convicted. He's about average height for his age, weighs 145 lbs, which might be on the slender side. Never been married, living alone, has a bachelor's degree and is currently enrolled in a four-year college. Held one job in the past year, which seems stable. Drug history includes marijuana and cocaine in the last four years, but hasn't felt depressed lately. Growing up, he lived with both bio parents in a household of four, and he believes God plays a role in his personal life.\n\nOkay, first things first, age is a factor. Twenty-two is still relatively young; some people at this age are still figuring things out. Gender-wise, males are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but that's a broad stroke. Ethnicity might play a role too, but in this case, he's white, and in many jurisdictions, whites are treated differently by the justice system compared to minorities, which could affect his risk profile.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant mark against him. Convictions suggest that his past behaviors have been severe enough to result in judicial action. However, he's enrolled in college, which is positive; education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Holding down a job is also good, showing some level of responsibility and integration into society.\n\nDrug use is a concern. Marijuana is relatively common, but cocaine is more serious. Past drug use can indicate potential for future illegal activities, especially if he's struggling with addiction. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest that his mental health is stable at the moment, which is positive.\n\nHis living situation\u2014living alone at 22\u2014is not uncommon, but lack of social support could be a risk factor. Family background seems stable, with both parents present, which is generally a protective factor. His religious beliefs might also provide him with moral guidance and a support network.\n\nOverall, there are both risk factors and protective factors here. The convictions and drug history suggest higher risk, but his current educational and employment status indicate stability. Maybe his risk isn't extremely high, but it's not negligible either.\n\nI think, considering all this, my prediction is that he poses some risk, but perhaps not at the highest level. So, \"NO\" for high risk, with a confidence of, say, 70%. That seems about right.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
