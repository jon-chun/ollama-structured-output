    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 19-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a notable mark against him. Typically, having a criminal record is a significant risk factor for future offending. The fact that he's only 19 suggests that he might still be maturing and could potentially continue down a path of crime if not intervened properly.\n\nHe's 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 144 lbs. Not sure how much physical attributes play into risk assessment, but I don't think height and weight are major indicators on their own.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could be a risk factor. Stability in living situations is often considered; living with family or peers can provide support, whereas living alone might lack that safety net.\n\nEducational background: He has a GED, which is better than no high school diploma, but it's not a traditional diploma. Not being enrolled in college means he might not have structured activities or the prospect of future employment that education can bring.\n\nEmployment history: Holding four jobs in a year suggests instability in employment. Frequent job changes can be a risk factor, possibly indicating difficulty maintaining employment or impulsivity in decision-making.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Substance abuse is a significant correlate with criminal behavior, so his abstinence from drugs is a plus.\n\nMental health: No depression in the past month is also positive. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nBackground: Living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family structure and environment can play a role; living with both parents is often seen as more stable, but since he was with his biological mother, we don't know about the presence of a father or step-parents.\n\nReligious belief: He believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some individuals, providing guidance and a sense of purpose.\n\nOverall, considering these factors, I would say there are both risk and protective factors present. The criminal history is a significant risk, and the employment instability is concerning. However, his avoidance of drugs, lack of recent depression, and spiritual beliefs could be protective.\n\nGiven this mix, I'm going to predict that he is at high risk, but with some reservations due to the protective factors. So, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 75%.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
