    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to analyze these risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I have to respond with a JSON object that says either \"YES\" or \"NO\" for the prediction and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors:\n\n- Age: 21\n\n- Gender: Male\n\n- Race: Black\n\n- Arrests: 3 times, no convictions\n\n- Height: 5'9\"\n\n- Weight: 170 lbs\n\n- Marital status: Never married, not living alone\n\n- Education: GED, not enrolled in college\n\n- Employment: Held 3 jobs in the past year\n\n- Drug use: Marijuana in the past four years, some days in the past month feeling depressed\n\n- Early life: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in a rural area\n\n- Belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nOkay, let's consider each factor and see how they might relate to risk.\n\nStarting with demographic factors:\n\n- Age: 21 is typically considered young adulthood. Statistically, crime rates tend to decrease as people age beyond their late teens and early twenties.\n\n- Gender: Male. Historically, males are overrepresented in crime statistics.\n\n- Race: Black. There are disparities in the criminal justice system, with higher arrest and incarceration rates for blacks compared to other races.\n\nArrest history:\n\n- 3 arrests but no convictions. This suggests some level of involvement with the law but without formal adjudication of guilt.\n\nPhysical attributes:\n\n- Height and weight seem average; not sure if this is relevant.\n\nLiving situation:\n\n- Never married, not living alone. Living with others could be stabilizing or not, depending on the circumstances.\n\nEducation and employment:\n\n- GED indicates completed high school equivalency, but not college enrollment. Holding 3 jobs in a year might suggest instability or needing to work multiple jobs due to financial constraints.\n\nDrug use and mental health:\n\n- Marijuana use in the past four years and recent feelings of depression. Substance use and mental health issues can be risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nEarly life experiences:\n\n- Lived with biological mother in a rural area in a household of 3. Family structure and environment can influence risk.\n\nBelief in God's personal impact:\n\n- This might indicate a sense of spirituality, which could be a protective factor for some.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together:\n\n- The arrest history without convictions is concerning but doesn't confirm criminal behavior.\n\n- The drug use and recent depression could be significant risk factors.\n\n- The employment instability, suggested by holding multiple jobs in a year, might also indicate challenges.\n\n- The demographic factors, particularly being young, male, and black, put him in a group that has higher crime rates statistically.\n\nHowever, he has not been convicted despite arrests, which is positive. He has a GED, suggesting some level of education achievement. Living with others might provide some social support.\n\nOverall, it's a mix of risk factors and protective factors. But given the arrest history, drug use, mental health symptoms, and demographic risks, I would lean towards predicting high risk.\n\nFor confidence, I'd say 70%. There are significant risk factors, but also some uncertain elements, like the lack of convictions and the unknown nature of his living situation and social supports.\n\nSo, my response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",

He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
