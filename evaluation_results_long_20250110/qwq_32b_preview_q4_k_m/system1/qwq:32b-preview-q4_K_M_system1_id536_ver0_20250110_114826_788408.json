    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I need to give my answer in a specific JSON format, with just \"prediction\" being \"YES\" or \"NO\", and a \"confidence\" score between 0 and 100. No extra explanations, just that.\n\nSo, let's see what I've got here:\n\n- The person is an 18-year-old female, identifies as Black.\n\n- She's been arrested once but not convicted.\n\n- Height: 5'7\", weight: 120 lbs.\n\n- Never married, living alone.\n\n- Has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n\n- Held three jobs in the past year.\n\n- Used marijuana in the past four years and has had periods in the last month feeling really down.\n\n- Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, household size four.\n\n- Believes God influences personal events.\n\nOkay, first thing I notice is that she's young, 18, which might be a factor since younger individuals sometimes exhibit higher risk behaviors. Being female might be relevant too, although historically, male offenders are more common in certain types of crimes.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests some level of involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's harder to gauge the seriousness. Maybe it was a minor offense?\n\nHer educational background: high school diploma, not in college. Employment history: held three jobs in a year. That seems like she's trying to establish herself professionally, but the job turnover might indicate instability or perhaps just figuring things out at her age.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Depending on the context, this could be a risk factor, especially if usage is frequent or if it's leading to other issues.\n\nMental health: She's been feeling down, to the point where nothing could cheer her up. This could indicate depression or other mood disorders, which might affect judgment and behavior.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in an urban area, household size four. That seems stable, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could be an environmental factor.\n\nReligious belief: believes God influences personal events. This might suggest a moral compass or support system, which could be protective.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to make a prediction: yes, high risk, or no, not high risk. And give a confidence score.\n\nHmm. The arrest but no conviction is a bit tricky. It suggests some involvement but without a conviction, it's hard to know the details. The drug use is marijuana, which is less severe than harder drugs, but still, drug use can be associated with other risky behaviors.\n\nThe mental health aspect concerns me. Feeling down and nothing can cheer her up could be a sign of depression, which might increase risk if not managed properly.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could be seen as independent, but also potentially more vulnerable to certain risks.\n\nEducation and employment: having a high school diploma is good, but the job turnover might indicate instability.\n\nOverall, I would say that there are some risk factors present, like the arrest, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone at a young age. However, there are also protective factors, like having completed high school, believing in a higher power, and having grown up in a stable family environment.\n\nGiven all this, I'm going to lean towards \"NO\", meaning she doesn't indicate high risk, but I'll have to choose a confidence level.\n\nLet me think. If I had to put a number on it, maybe 70%. So, prediction: \"NO\", confidence: 70.\n\nBut wait, is that too high or too low? Let's see.\n\nIf I say 70%, that means I'm reasonably confident that she's not high risk, but there's still a 30% chance I could be wrong. Given the presence of several risk factors, maybe 70% is a bit too confident.\n\nAlternatively, if I go with \"YES\", indicating high risk, but again, considering the mix of risk and protective factors, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe a better call would be \"NO\" with a lower confidence, say 60%. That way, I'm still leaning towards not high risk, but acknowledging that there are notable risk factors present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"YES\" with 60% confidence. That could also make sense, given the arrest history, drug use, and mental health issues.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the safest call is \"NO\" with 60% confidence, recognizing that while there are risks, the protective factors and the lack of convictions suggest that she's not currently high risk.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The arrest, even without conviction, could indicate potential for future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, her educational attainment and employment efforts are positive signs.\n\nI think I'll stick with \"NO\" at 60% confidence.\n\n## Final Prediction\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n",
