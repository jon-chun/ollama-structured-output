    "raw_message_text": "Okay, I need to analyze these risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I should respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" score between 0 and 100.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Demographics:**\n\n- Age: 19 years old\n\n- Gender: Male\n\n- Race: White\n\n- Height: 7 feet 3 inches\n\n- Weight: 140 lbs\n\n2. **Criminal History:**\n\n- Arrested 2 times but no convictions\n\n3. **Marital Status and Living Situation:**\n\n- Never married\n\n- Currently living alone\n\n4. **Education and Employment:**\n\n- No high school diploma or GED\n\n- Not enrolled in college\n\n- Held 1 job during the year\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health:**\n\n- Used marijuana in the past four years\n\n- Not feeling depressed over the past month\n\n6. **Background:**\n\n- Lived with biological dad in a household of size 5 in an urban area\n\n- Believes God has nothing to do with personal events\n\nOkay, let's consider each of these factors one by one and see how they might relate to risk.\n\n**Age:** 19 years old. Generally, younger individuals are considered higher risk because they may lack maturity and stability.\n\n**Gender:** Male. Statistically, males are more likely to be involved in criminal activity than females.\n\n**Race:** White. In many datasets, race can be a factor, but it's important to approach this cautiously and ensure that any considerations are based on data and not biases.\n\n**Height and Weight:** 7 feet 3 inches and 140 lbs. This seems unusually tall for that weight, which might indicate health issues or simply being very lean. Not sure how this directly relates to risk.\n\n**Criminal History:** Arrested twice but no convictions. This suggests some involvement in problematic behavior, but without convictions, it's harder to gauge the seriousness.\n\n**Marital Status and Living Situation:** Never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support.\n\n**Education and Employment:** No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, held only one job in a year. This suggests limited educational attainment and unstable employment, both of which are risk factors.\n\n**Substance Use and Mental Health:** Used marijuana in the past four years but not feeling depressed recently. Substance use is a known risk factor, especially for younger individuals.\n\n**Background:** Lived with biological dad in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Family structure and upbringing can influence risk, but this is more nuanced.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like there are several indicators of higher risk:\n\n- Young age\n\n- Male gender\n\n- No high school diploma\n\n- Unstable employment\n\n- Substance use history\n\n- Living alone\n\nHowever, there are also some mitigating factors:\n\n- No convictions despite arrests\n\n- Not currently feeling depressed\n\nGiven the preponderance of risk factors, I would predict high risk.\n\nFor confidence, I'd say 80%. There's a solid basis for considering this individual high risk, but without more detailed information about the nature of the arrests and other contextual factors, I can't be entirely certain.\n\nSo, my JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\{\"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 80\\}} \\]",
