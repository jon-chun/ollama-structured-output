    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this case to assess risk based on these factors. First off, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are often considered in risk assessments, but I need to look at everything together.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to note. Arrests can indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity, even if there wasn't a conviction. Maybe it was a minor offense or circumstances led to no conviction, but it's still a mark on his record.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 145 lbs. Not sure how much this factors in, but perhaps it's relevant for certain types of crimes that require physical strength or agility.\n\nNever been married and not living alone. Living situation can be important; stable housing and relationships are often protective factors against reoffending.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Education level is a significant factor; lower education is linked to higher crime rates. Not being enrolled in college suggests he might not have many prosocial activities or future prospects, which could increase risk.\n\nOnly held one job in the past year. Employment stability is crucial. Frequent job changes or unemployment can be risk factors, so having only one job might indicate instability, but it's hard to say with just one year of data.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is positive. Substance abuse is closely tied to criminal behavior, so abstinence from drugs is a good sign.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important; depression can sometimes lead to reckless behavior, so not feeling depressed is favorable.\n\nBackground: lived with biological dad in a rural area in a household of four. Family structure and environment can influence behavior. Living with both parents is generally seen as protective, but I need to consider that it was a rural setting, which might have different social dynamics.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual beliefs can provide coping mechanisms and discourage antisocial behavior.\n\nSo, weighing all this, most of the factors seem neutral to slightly negative, with some positive aspects. The arrest history is a concern, but no conviction could mean it was a minor issue or misjudgment. The lack of education and unstable employment are worries, as is the single job in the past year. However, no drug use and no depression are positives. The family background seems fairly stable, which is good.\n\nI'd say overall, there's some risk here, but not extremely high. Maybe around medium risk. But since I need to give a binary prediction of \"YES\" for high risk or \"NO\" for not high risk, and a confidence level, I'll have to decide.\n\nGiven that most of the risk factors are moderate and some are positive, I don't think this indicates high risk. So my prediction is \"NO,\" not high risk. Confidence-wise, I feel pretty sure about this assessment, so maybe 85%.\n\nBut wait, the arrest history might be a red flag. If that arrest was for a serious offense, even without conviction, it could indicate potential for future issues. But since it's only one arrest and no conviction, perhaps it's not indicative of persistent criminal behavior.\n\nAlso, the educational level is low, which is a significant risk factor. However, he's not engaged in drug use or showing signs of depression, which are positives.\n\nI think sticking with \"NO\" for high risk at 85% confidence is reasonable.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
