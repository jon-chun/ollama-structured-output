    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this case to assess risk based on these factors. First off, the person is a 19-year-old male, Hispanic, arrested twice but no convictions yet. He's married, living with his spouse, has a high school diploma, no jobs in the last year, used marijuana in the past four years, no depression in the last month, lived with both bio parents in an urban area in a household of six, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nOkay, so starting with age and gender. Young males are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activity, especially without stable employment or education pursuits post-high school. Being Hispanic might also play a role depending on regional statistics, but that's a bit sensitive; I have to be careful not to let stereotypes influence my assessment.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but no convictions, which could suggest either that he's involved in risky behaviors or that the arrests were unfounded. Hard to say without more context, but multiple arrests do raise some flags.\n\nMarried and living with spouse is generally a positive sign, indicating some level of stability and commitment. High school diploma is okay, but no college or job in the last year is concerning. Job history can be a significant factor; lack thereof might indicate difficulty integrating into the workforce or disinterest, which could correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana specifically\u2014is present, which is a risk factor, especially if usage is frequent or if it indicates potential for other substance abuse. No depression recently is positive, but mental health can fluctuate.\n\nHis background living with both parents in an urban area with a household size of six\u2014again, depending on the specific dynamics, this could be neutral to positive. Belief in God's influence could suggest some moral framework or support system.\n\nOverall, there are several risk factors present: young age, male gender, arrest history, lack of employment or education advancement post-high school, drug use, and limited recent stable activities. However, being married and living with spouse is a positive.\n\nGiven all this, I would predict high risk, but with moderate confidence because some factors are positive and offset others.\n\nSo, in JSON format as requested:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 60\n\n}\n\n",
