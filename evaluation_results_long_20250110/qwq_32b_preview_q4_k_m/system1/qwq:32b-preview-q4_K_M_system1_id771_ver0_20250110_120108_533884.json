    "raw_message_text": "Okay, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that says either \"YES\" or \"NO\" for the prediction and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nSo, let's see what I have here:\n\n- The person is a 22-year-old male, Hispanic.\n\n- He's been arrested 3 times and has convictions.\n\n- He's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs.\n\n- Never married, not living alone.\n\n- Has a high school diploma but isn't in college.\n\n- Held only one job in the past year.\n\n- No drug use in the last four years.\n\n- Not depressed in the past month.\n\n- Lived with his biological mother in a household of two when young.\n\n- Doesn't believe God affects personal events.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to think about what typically indicates high risk in criminal justice contexts. Things like arrest history, convictions, employment status, education level, marital status, living situation, substance abuse, mental health, and even childhood environment can all play a role.\n\nStarting with the arrest and conviction history: he's been arrested three times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, which would typically indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nNext, his employment history: only one job in the past year. That might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be another risk factor. However, I don't know the specifics of why he only had one job\u2014it could be stable employment, or it could mean he had trouble keeping jobs.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Depending on the field and job market, this could be neutral or slightly risky. In some areas, lacking higher education can limit opportunities, potentially leading to more criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. Living situation can be important; living with family or others might provide support, which could be positive, or it could sometimes enable certain behaviors.\n\nDrug use: no usage in the past four years. That's a positive sign, indicating he's been clean for a while.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. That's also good.\n\nEarly childhood: lived with biological mother in a household of two. Not sure if there's any significance here without more context.\n\nBelief in God's influence: personally, I don't think this directly correlates with risk levels in criminal behavior, but some studies might suggest otherwise.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the arrest and conviction history stand out as the most significant indicators of high risk. The employment history is somewhat concerning, but the lack of drug use and absence of depression are positive signs.\n\nGiven that, I would predict high risk, but with some reservations because of the clean time from drugs and no recent depression.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level around 85%.\n\nHere's how I'll format the response:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nI think that captures it appropriately.\n\n",
