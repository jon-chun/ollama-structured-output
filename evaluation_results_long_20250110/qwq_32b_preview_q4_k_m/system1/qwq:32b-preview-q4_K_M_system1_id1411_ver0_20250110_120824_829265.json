    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task here. I need to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and then respond with a JSON object that has a prediction of \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nSo, let's see what we're working with:\n\n- The person is a 22-year-old male, White.\n\n- He's been arrested 4 times and has convictions.\n\n- He's tall: 6'4\", weighs 190 lbs.\n\n- Never married, not living alone.\n\n- Has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college.\n\n- Held only one job in the past year.\n\n- Used marijuana in the past four years and has had depressive feelings recently.\n\n- Growing up, he lived with his bio mom in an urban area, household size 4.\n\n- He doesn't believe God affects personal events.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to think about what constitutes high risk in a criminal justice context. Typically, risk assessment looks at factors like past criminal behavior, substance abuse, mental health issues, stability in employment and housing, and social connections.\n\nStarting with the arrests and convictions: four arrests and convictions are a significant red flag. Each arrest suggests a pattern of behavior that has led to run-ins with the law, and convictions confirm that he's been found guilty of offenses. This is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHis age is 22, which is somewhat young, but not necessarily a protective factor, especially given his criminal history.\n\nHe's enrolled in college, which is positive. Education can be a protective factor, as it provides structure and opportunities for positive development. However, the fact that he's only held one job in the past year might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis substance use\u2014marijuana in the past four years and recent depressive feelings\u2014indicates potential mental health issues and substance abuse problems. Both of these can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with others and not alone could be seen as both positive and negative. On one hand, having a support system can be protective. On the other hand, if he's living with others due to inability to live independently, that might indicate dependency or lack of autonomy, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis belief about God potentially suggests a lack of spiritual coping mechanisms, which some research indicates can be a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the arrests and convictions stand out as the most significant risk indicators. The substance use and recent depressive feelings also add to the risk profile. The educational enrollment is a positive, but may not outweigh the other factors.\n\nI would predict high risk in this case.\n\nNow, for the confidence level. Given the multiple arrests and convictions, combined with recent substance use and depressive symptoms, I'd say my confidence is quite high. Maybe 90%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 90\n\n}\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there anything here that strongly suggests low risk? He's in college, which is positive, and he's living with others, which could provide some support. However, the arrests and convictions outweigh these positives in my opinion.\n\nYes, I think \"YES\" with 90% confidence is appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```\n",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
