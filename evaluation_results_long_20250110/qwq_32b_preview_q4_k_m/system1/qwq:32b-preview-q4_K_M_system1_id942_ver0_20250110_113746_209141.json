    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this profile to assess for risk. The subject is a 20-year-old white male, arrested once but no conviction yet. He's 5'9\", 155 lbs, lives alone, never married, has a high school diploma, worked two jobs in the last year, used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, hasn't been depressed lately, grew up with both bio parents in an urban area of three people, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, age is a big factor. Twenty-year-olds are still developing decision-making skills, and statistically, younger adults tend to take more risks. Being male also tips the scale a bit since males are generally overrepresented in criminal statistics.\n\nHis arrest record: arrested once, no conviction. That's somewhat concerning because it shows some involvement with the law, even if it didn't lead to a conviction. Maybe he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps it was a minor offense. Hard to say without more details, but it's still a mark on his record.\n\nEducational background: high school diploma, not in college. Education level can be indicative of future stability. Not being enrolled in higher education might suggest limited prospects or interests, which could correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the last year. That could mean he's industrious, trying to make ends meet, or possibly job-hopping, which might indicate instability.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant red flag. Cocaine is a serious drug, and any illicit drug use increases the risk of related criminal activities, such as possession, distribution, or involvement in crimes to support a habit.\n\nNo depression in the last month is positive, but mental health history can still be relevant. Maybe he's struggled in the past, but currently stable.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of three. That seems relatively stable compared to some other backgrounds. Growing up in an intact family can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence exposure.\n\nReligious belief: believes God influences personal events. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some, providing moral guidance and support systems.\n\nOverall, there are several risk factors here: young age, male gender, arrest history, drug use, employment instability, and living alone. The protective factors include having completed high school, growing up in an intact family, and holding jobs. But the drug use and arrest history are significant concerns.\n\nGiven all this, I would predict higher risk, but not extremely high. Maybe around 70% confidence in a \"yes\" prediction.\n\nSo, in the required format:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\nI think that's a reasonable assessment based on the provided information.\n\n",
