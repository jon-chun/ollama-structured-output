    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I've got this case to predict whether this 18-year-old mixed-race female will be rearrested within three years. She's been arrested once but not convicted, lives alone, is enrolled in school, has worked two jobs in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years, sometimes feels really down, and believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the risk factors and assign weights to them: low, medium, or high. Then, based on these weights and the patterns from the examples provided, make a prediction.\n\nLet's list out the risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 18 years old\n\n2. Gender: Female\n\n3. Race: Mixed race\n\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\n\n5. Living situation: Lives alone\n\n6. Education: Enrolled in school\n\n7. Employment: Held 2 jobs in the past year\n\n8. Drug use: Marijuana in the past four years\n\n9. Mental health: Sometimes feels down\n\n10. Spiritual belief: Believes God has a role in her life\n\nNow, I'll assign weights to each factor based on what I've observed in the examples.\n\nStarting with age:\n\n- Most examples are between 18 and 22 years old.\n\n- In the examples, age doesn't seem to be a strong predictor on its own.\n\n- However, being 18 might be somewhat risky because she's young and perhaps more impulsive.\n\nWeight: Low\n\nNext, gender:\n\n- Most examples are males, with a few females.\n\n- In the provided examples, females seem less likely to recidivate.\n\n- For instance, Example 30 is a 22-year-old white female with similar characteristics to this case, and the outcome is \"NO.\"\n\nWeight: Low (possibly negative risk)\n\nRace:\n\n- The race seems mixed, which isn't directly represented in the examples.\n\n- Most examples are Black, White, or mixed race.\n\n- Doesn't seem to be a strong predictor alone.\n\nWeight: Low\n\nArrest history:\n\n- This individual has been arrested once but not convicted.\n\n- Example 1 has a similar arrest history and predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 2 has multiple arrests and convictions, predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- So, a single arrest without conviction might carry low risk.\n\nWeight: Low\n\nLiving situation:\n\n- Lives alone.\n\n- Example 1 lives alone, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 2 lives alone, predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- Mixed signals here.\n\n- Perhaps not a strong predictor on its own.\n\nWeight: Low\n\nEducation:\n\n- Enrolled in school.\n\n- Example 1 is enrolled in school, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 3 is not enrolled, predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- Seems like being enrolled in school might be positive.\n\nWeight: Medium (positive)\n\nEmployment:\n\n- Held 2 jobs in the past year.\n\n- Example 1 has held jobs, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 6 has held 3 jobs, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Employment seems stable, which is positive.\n\nWeight: Medium (positive)\n\nDrug use:\n\n- Used marijuana in the past four years.\n\n- Example 1 used marijuana, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 2 used marijuana and cocaine, predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- So, drug use is a bit risky, but depends on the type and frequency.\n\nWeight: Medium\n\nMental health:\n\n- Sometimes feels down.\n\n- Example 1 has this characteristic, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 2 has \"most of the time,\" predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- The severity seems to matter.\n\nWeight: Low to medium\n\nSpiritual belief:\n\n- Believes God has a role in her life.\n\n- Example 1 has this, predicted \"NO.\"\n\n- Example 2 does not, predicted \"YES.\"\n\n- Seems positive.\n\nWeight: Low (positive)\n\nNow, compiling these weights:\n\n- Low risk factors: Age, gender, race, arrest history, living situation, sometimes feels down, spiritual belief.\n\n- Medium positive: Education, employment.\n\n- Medium risk: Drug use.\n\nOverall, most factors are low risk, with education and employment being medium positive, and drug use being a medium risk.\n\nGiven that, and looking back at the examples, this case seems closer to Example 1, who had similar characteristics and was predicted \"NO.\"\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of around 75%.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age: 18 years old\", \"low\", \"Young age may indicate some impulsivity, but not a strong predictor.\"),\n\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Females in examples less likely to recidivate.\"),\n\n    (\"Race: Mixed race\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern in examples.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction seems low risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Living situation: Lives alone\", \"low\", \"Mixed signals in examples.\"),\n\n    (\"Education: Enrolled in school\", \"medium\", \"Positive indicator, correlated with lower recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment: Held 2 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Stable employment is positive.\"),\n\n    (\"Drug use: Marijuana in the past four years\", \"medium\", \"Some drug use, but not severe.\"),\n\n    (\"Mental health: Sometimes feels down\", \"low\", \"Mild mental health issues, not severe.\"),\n\n    (\"Spiritual belief: Believes God has a role in her life\", \"low\", \"Positive spiritual belief.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n",
