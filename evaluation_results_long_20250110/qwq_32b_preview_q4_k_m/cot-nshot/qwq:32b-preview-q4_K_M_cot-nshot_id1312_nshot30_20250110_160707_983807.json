    "raw_message_text": "I've been given this task to predict whether a 21-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years based on various factors. There are about 30 examples provided, each with different combinations of factors and their outcomes. My goal is to analyze these examples, understand which factors are more influential, and then apply that understanding to the new case.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors mentioned in the examples:\n\n1. **Age**: Ranges from 20 to 22 years old.\n\n2. **Gender**: Male or Female.\n\n3. **Race**: Black or White.\n\n4. **Arrest History**: Number of times arrested and conviction status.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Married or Single.\n\n6. **Education**: High school diploma, GED, or neither; college enrollment status.\n\n7. **Employment**: Number of jobs held in the past year.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: Types of drugs used in the past four years.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: Depression symptoms in the past month.\n\n10. **Upbringing**: Living situation during childhood (e.g., with both parents, single parent, large family).\n\n11. **Religious Belief**: Attitude towards religion.\n\nGiven that all cases are 21-year-olds, age might not be a differentiating factor here. So, I'll focus on the other variables.\n\nI need to assign a relative weight to each factor based on its impact on rearrest recidivism. The weights can be low, medium, or high.\n\nLet's start by looking at the arrest history. In examples 1, 2, 3, and so on, arrest history seems to be a significant factor. For instance, in example 1, the individual was arrested once but not convicted, and the outcome was \"YES\" for rearrest. Similarly, in example 7, multiple arrests led to a \"YES\" outcome.\n\n**Arrest History**: High weight\n\nNext, **conviction status**. In example 4, the individual was arrested multiple times and convicted, resulting in \"YES,\" while in example 2, arrest without conviction still led to \"YES.\" So, arrest history seems more impactful than conviction status.\n\n**Conviction Status**: Medium weight\n\n**Gender**: Looking at examples, both males and females have \"YES\" and \"NO\" outcomes. No clear pattern here.\n\n**Race**: Most examples are Black, with mixed outcomes. One White example in example 10 has a \"NO\" outcome.\n\n**Education**: In example 5, lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college led to \"YES.\" In contrast, example 9 had similar education but outcome was \"NO.\"\n\n**Employment**: Holding jobs seems somewhat protective, but not always. Example 6 had three jobs and still had a \"YES\" outcome.\n\n**Drug Use**: Using drugs, especially harder drugs like cocaine, seems linked to higher recidivism. In example 3, drug use led to \"YES.\"\n\n**Mental Health**: Depression symptoms seem to influence outcomes. Example 8 had depression and resulted in \"YES.\"\n\n**Upbringing**: Living situation in childhood might have an impact. Large families or single-parent homes could be risk factors.\n\n**Religious Belief**: Attitude towards religion might influence outcomes, but it's less clear.\n\nNow, applying this understanding to the new case:\n\n- **Arrest History**: Arrested once, not convicted. (High weight)\n\n- **Gender**: Male. (Low weight)\n\n- **Race**: Black. (Medium weight)\n\n- **Marital Status**: Single, living alone. (Medium weight)\n\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. (Medium weight)\n\n- **Employment**: No jobs held in the past year. (Medium weight)\n\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. (High weight)\n\n- **Mental Health**: No depression in the past month. (Low weight)\n\n- **Upbringing**: Lived with biological mother in a large household of 11 in a rural area. (Medium weight)\n\n- **Religious Belief**: Considers God irrelevant. (Low weight)\n\nConsidering these factors and their assigned weights, it seems that several high-weight factors point towards a higher risk of rearrest:\n\n- Arrest history: High weight, arrested once without conviction.\n\n- Drug use: High weight, used marijuana and cocaine.\n\nAdditionally, medium-weight factors also suggest risks:\n\n- Lack of education and employment.\n\n- Single, living alone.\n\n- Large household in rural area.\n\nDespite no depression symptoms and being Black (which might have some racial bias in the justice system), the combination of arrest history and drug use are strong indicators for potential rearrest.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nI would rate my confidence at around 80%.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Arrest History\", \"High\"],\n    [\"Conviction Status\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"Low\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Marital Status\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Drug Use\", \"High\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"Low\"],\n    [\"Upbringing\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Religious Belief\", \"Low\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Arrest History\", \"High\"],\n    [\"Conviction Status\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"Low\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Marital Status\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Drug Use\", \"High\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"Low\"],\n    [\"Upbringing\", \"Medium\"],\n    [\"Religious Belief\", \"Low\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
