    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I have this case to predict whether a 21-year-old Black female will be rearrested within three years. She's been arrested once and convicted, lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, hasn't held a job in the past year, has used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years, and sometimes feels down. She lived with her biological mother in an urban area when she was young, and she believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the risk factors and assign weights to them based on their importance in predicting recidivism. I have some examples to guide me, so I'll use those as a reference.\n\nLet's start with age. She's 21, which might be considered young. In the examples, ages range from 18 to 22. Maybe age isn't a strong predictor on its own, so I'll give it a low weight.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. In the examples, there are both males and females, with mixed outcomes. It seems like gender isn't a major factor here, so low weight.\n\nRace: she's Black. In some studies, race can be a factor, but in these examples, races have mixed outcomes. I'll give it a medium weight, considering it might have some influence.\n\nArrest and conviction history: she's been arrested once and convicted. In example #30, a 22-year-old White female with similar arrest history didn't recidivate, but in other examples, having a conviction might increase risk. I'll give this a high weight since criminal history is often a strong predictor.\n\nMarital status: she's unmarried and lives alone. In example #15, an unmarried, non-living-alone individual recidivated, while in #30, an unmarried, living-alone individual didn't. Maybe not a strong predictor; low weight.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED. In example #4, lack of education led to recidivism, but in #27, similar education level didn't lead to recidivism. Medium weight.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. In example #10, unemployment was associated with recidivism, but in #27, unemployed didn't recidivate. Medium weight.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. In example #5, drug use was a factor in recidivism, and in #10, it was also present. High weight.\n\nMental health: sometimes feels down. In example #28, similar sentiment led to recidivism, but in others, it didn't. Medium weight.\n\nUpbringing: lived with biological mother in an urban area. Doesn't seem consistent across examples; low weight.\n\nReligious belief: believes God plays a role in her life. In some examples, this was present in both recidivists and non-recidivists; low weight.\n\nNow, looking at the weights:\n\n- Age: low\n\n- Gender: low\n\n- Race: medium\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: high\n\n- Marital status: low\n\n- Education: medium\n\n- Employment: medium\n\n- Drug use: high\n\n- Mental health: medium\n\n- Upbringing: low\n\n- Religious belief: low\n\nSo, the high-weight factors are arrest/conviction history and drug use. Both of these are present and are weighted heavily. The medium-weight factors include race, education, employment, and mental health, which are also concerning.\n\nGiven that the high-weight factors are present, and most medium-weight factors are also unfavorable, I would predict a higher chance of recidivism.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\n- Example #5: similar drug use, recidivated.\n\n- Example #10: arrest, conviction, unemployment, drug use \u2013 recidivated.\n\n- Example #28: arrest, conviction, unemployment, drug use, similar mental health \u2013 did not recidivate.\n\n- Example #30: arrest, conviction, similar drug use, living alone \u2013 did not recidivate.\n\nHmm, there's inconsistency in the examples. However, considering the weights, I'm going to predict YES for recidivism.\n\nI'd estimate my confidence at 75%. There are several risk factors present, but the examples show mixed outcomes.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is considered a weaker predictor in this context.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender does not seem to be a strong factor based on the examples.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Race may have some influence, but outcomes vary in the examples.\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Criminal history is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status and living alone don't show a clear pattern in the examples.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is a medium-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment is a medium-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a high-risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Occasional feelings of being down are a medium-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Upbringing factors vary too much to be a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious belief doesn't show a consistent pattern in the examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is considered a weaker predictor in this context.\"],\n    [\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender does not seem to be a strong factor based on the examples.\"],\n    [\"race\", \"medium\", \"Race may have some influence, but outcomes vary in the examples.\"],\n    [\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Criminal history is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"],\n    [\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status and living alone don't show a clear pattern in the examples.\"],\n    [\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is a medium-risk factor.\"],\n    [\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment is a medium-risk factor.\"],\n    [\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a high-risk factor for recidivism.\"],\n    [\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Occasional feelings of being down are a medium-risk factor.\"],\n    [\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Upbringing factors vary too much to be a strong predictor.\"],\n    [\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious belief doesn't show a consistent pattern in the examples.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
