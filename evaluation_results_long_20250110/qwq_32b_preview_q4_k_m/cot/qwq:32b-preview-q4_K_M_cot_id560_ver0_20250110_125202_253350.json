    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period based on various factors provided. I'll evaluate each factor, assign a relative weight of low, medium, or high based on its impact on recidivism, and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old\n\n2. Gender: Male\n\n3. Ethnicity: American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut\n\n4. Arrest history: 2 arrests, convicted\n\n5. Physical attributes: 6'2\" tall, 160 lbs\n\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n\n8. Employment: No jobs held in the past year\n\n9. Substance use: Used marijuana in the past four years, some days in the past month felt down\n\n10. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area\n\n11. Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor one by one.\n\n**1. Age: 21 years old**\n\nResearch shows that younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior. However, by age 21, some may be maturing out of that phase. But statistically, still a higher risk compared to older ages.\n\n**Weight:** Medium\n\n**Reasoning:** While youth is a risk factor, at 21, there's a possibility of stabilization.\n\n**2. Gender: Male**\n\nMales are generally more likely to commit crimes than females.\n\n**Weight:** High\n\n**Reasoning:** Well-established statistic across various studies.\n\n**3. Ethnicity: American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut**\n\nSome ethnic groups may have higher rates of interaction with the criminal justice system due to various social and economic factors.\n\n**Weight:** Medium\n\n**Reasoning:** There might be systemic issues affecting this group, but it's not as heavily studied as some other groups.\n\n**4. Arrest history: 2 arrests, convicted**\n\nHaving a prior conviction is a strong indicator of future offending.\n\n**Weight:** High\n\n**Reasoning:** Recidivism rates are higher among those with prior convictions.\n\n**5. Physical attributes: 6'2\" tall, 160 lbs**\n\nPhysical attributes like height and weight don't typically correlate directly with recidivism.\n\n**Weight:** Low\n\n**Reasoning:** No direct link between physical stature and reoffending.\n\n**6. Marital status: Never married, living alone**\n\nUnmarried individuals, especially those living alone, may have less social support, which can be a risk factor.\n\n**Weight:** Medium\n\n**Reasoning:** Social support can be protective; lack thereof may increase risk.\n\n**7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college**\n\nLow education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited employment opportunities.\n\n**Weight:** High\n\n**Reasoning:** Education is crucial for job prospects and overall stability.\n\n**8. Employment: No jobs held in the past year**\n\nUnemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n**Weight:** High\n\n**Reasoning:** Without stable employment, individuals may turn to crime out of necessity or lack of structure.\n\n**9. Substance use: Used marijuana in the past four years, some days in the past month felt down**\n\nSubstance use and mental health issues are both strong predictors of recidivism.\n\n**Weight:** High\n\n**Reasoning:** Both substance abuse and depression can lead to impaired judgment and increased likelihood of reoffending.\n\n**10. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area**\n\nStable family environments are generally protective, but living in urban areas may expose individuals to more criminal opportunities.\n\n**Weight:** Medium\n\n**Reasoning:** Stable home but potential environmental risks from urban setting.\n\n**11. Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events**\n\nReligious involvement can be a protective factor, providing support and guidance.\n\n**Weight:** Low to Medium\n\n**Reasoning:** Depending on the nature of religious involvement, it could offer positive influences, but the statement is somewhat vague.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- High weights: Gender, Arrest history, Education, Employment, Substance use\n\n- Medium weights: Age, Ethnicity, Marital status, Family background\n\n- Low weights: Physical attributes, Religious belief\n\nGiven that several high-weight factors point towards higher recidivism risk, particularly the combination of prior conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and substance use, it suggests a significant probability of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nHowever, some factors are more positive, such as living with both parents during upbringing and having a religious belief, which could provide some protective effects.\n\nOverall, considering the preponderance of high-risk factors, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n**Prediction:** YES\n\n**Confidence:** 85\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Youth is a risk factor, but at 21, there's potential for stabilization.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"High\", \"Males have higher crime rates statistically.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"Medium\", \"Systemic issues may affect this group.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history\", \"High\", \"Prior convictions indicate higher recidivism risk.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"Low\", \"No direct link to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone with less social support is a risk.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"High\", \"Low education levels correlate with higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"High\", \"Unemployment increases the chance of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Substance use\", \"High\", \"Drug use and mental health issues are strong predictors.\"],\n    [\"Family background\", \"Medium\", \"Stable family but urban environment may expose to crime.\"],\n    [\"Religious belief\", \"Low\", \"Potential protective factor, but variability exists.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Youth is a risk factor, but at 21, there's potential for stabilization.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"High\", \"Males have higher crime rates statistically.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"Medium\", \"Systemic issues may affect this group.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history\", \"High\", \"Prior convictions indicate higher recidivism risk.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"Low\", \"No direct link to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone with less social support is a risk.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"High\", \"Low education levels correlate with higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"High\", \"Unemployment increases the chance of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Substance use\", \"High\", \"Drug use and mental health issues are strong predictors.\"],\n    [\"Family background\", \"Medium\", \"Stable family but urban environment may expose to crime.\"],\n    [\"Religious belief\", \"Low\", \"Potential protective factor, but variability exists.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
