    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I've got this profile of a 22-year-old white female who's been arrested once and convicted. She's separated, living alone, has a GED, no job in the last year, hasn't used drugs in four years but has had some depressive feelings recently. She lived with non-biological parents in a large household as a kid and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the risk factors here and assign them weights: low, medium, or high, based on their impact on predicting rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nLet's start with demographic factors.\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old.\n\n   - Generally, younger adults have higher recidivism rates, but 22 might be a bit of a gray area. Maybe medium risk.\n\n2. **Gender**: Female.\n\n   - Females typically have lower recidivism rates than males. So, this would be a low risk factor.\n\n3. **Race**: White.\n\n   - Race can be a sensitive factor, but in many studies, race doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with recidivism once other factors are controlled for. I'll consider this low impact.\n\n4. **Arrest and conviction history**:\n\n   - Arrested once and convicted. This suggests some level of involvement in criminal behavior, which is a medium to high risk factor. Given it's only once, maybe medium.\n\n5. **Physical characteristics**: Height 5'5\", weight 214 lbs.\n\n   - Physical attributes aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism. Low impact.\n\n6. **Marital status**: Separated, living alone.\n\n   - Marital stability can be a protective factor. Being separated and living alone might indicate instability, so medium risk.\n\n7. **Education**: GED, not enrolled in college.\n\n   - A GED is less predictive of positive outcomes compared to a high school diploma, and not being enrolled in college could suggest limited future prospects, leading to higher risk. Medium to high.\n\n8. **Employment**: No jobs in the last year.\n\n   - Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High.\n\n9. **Drug use**: No drug use in the past four years.\n\n   - Lack of recent drug use is positive, indicating lower risk. Low.\n\n10. **Mental health**: Feeling down some of the time in the past month.\n\n    - Depression can be a risk factor if it leads to behavioral issues. This seems mild, so medium.\n\n11. **Early childhood environment**: Lived with non-biological parents in a large household.\n\n    - Childhood environment can impact adult behavior. Being in a large household with non-bio parents might indicate instability, so medium risk.\n\n12. **Spirituality**: Believes God influences personal events.\n\n    - Spirituality can be a protective factor for some individuals. Low to medium, perhaps leaning low.\n\nNow, let's consolidate these assessments.\n\n- Medium to high risk factors:\n\n  - Arrest and conviction history\n\n  - Marital status\n\n  - Education level\n\n  - Employment status\n\n- Medium risk factors:\n\n  - Age\n\n  - Mental health\n\n  - Early childhood environment\n\n- Low risk factors:\n\n  - Gender\n\n  - Race\n\n  - Physical characteristics\n\n  - Lack of recent drug use\n\n  - Spirituality\n\nGiven that there are several medium to high risk factors, particularly the lack of employment and education, which are both strong predictors of recidivism, I would lean towards predicting a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n\nHowever, the absence of recent drug use and being female could be mitigating factors.\n\nLet me think about the confidence level. With multiple medium to high risk factors, but also some low-risk factors, perhaps a confidence level around 70-80%.\n\nWait, but unemployment is a very strong predictor. Studies show that ex-offenders who find stable employment are less likely to recidivate. So, lacking employment is a significant red flag.\n\nSimilarly, educational attainment is crucial. Having only a GED and no current education suggests limited opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, she hasn't used drugs recently, which is positive.\n\nHer mild depressive symptoms might not be severely impacting her functioning, so that might not be as risky.\n\nHer belief in God could provide some support, but it's hard to quantify.\n\nOverall, considering the employment and education status, I'm going to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\n**Final Prediction: YES**\n\n**Confidence: 75%**\n\nNow, to structure this in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger adults have higher recidivism rates, but at 22, it's moderate.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a strong predictor once other factors are controlled.\"),\n    (\"Arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest and conviction indicate some criminal behavior, but not extensive history.\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not typically predictive of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Separated and living alone may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"GED and no college enrollment suggest limited prospects.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the last year is a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is positive.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Mild depressive feelings, potential impact on behavior.\"),\n    (\"Early childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with non-bio parents in a large household,\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n",
