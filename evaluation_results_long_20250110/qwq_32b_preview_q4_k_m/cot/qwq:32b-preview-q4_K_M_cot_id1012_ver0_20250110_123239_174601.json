    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and assign relative weights to each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old\n\n2. Gender: Female\n\n3. Race: Black\n\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, convicted\n\n5. Physical attributes: Height 5'6\", weight 150-174 lbs\n\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n\n8. Employment: No jobs held in the past year\n\n9. Substance abuse: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, recent depression symptoms\n\n10. Childhood environment: Lived with biological mother in an urban area, household size 4\n\n11. Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these factors in terms of their impact on recidivism risk and assign a weight: low, medium, or high.\n\nStarting with age:\n\n- Age 21: Research shows that criminal behavior tends to decrease with age as people mature. So, being 21 might still be in a higher-risk phase, but not necessarily the highest. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, gender:\n\n- Female: Historically, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, being female would likely be a low risk factor.\n\nRace:\n\n- Black: There are disparities in the criminal justice system affecting minority groups, which might influence recidivism rates. However, it's important to handle this factor carefully. I'll consider this a medium risk factor, acknowledging potential systemic biases.\n\nArrest and conviction history:\n\n- 1 arrest, convicted: Having a conviction suggests a higher risk compared to no convictions. This would likely be a high risk factor.\n\nPhysical attributes:\n\n- Height and weight: These are generally not directly related to recidivism risk. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nMarital status and living situation:\n\n- Never married, living alone: Stability in personal life can influence recidivism. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation level:\n\n- No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college: Low education levels are correlated with higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities. This would be a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment history:\n\n- No jobs held in the past year: Unemployment can lead to higher recidivism due to lack of structure and financial stability. This is another high risk factor.\n\nSubstance abuse:\n\n- Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, recent depression symptoms: Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism. This would be a high risk factor.\n\nChildhood environment:\n\n- Lived with biological mother in an urban area, household size 4: Childhood environments can influence criminal behavior, but this is more of a background factor. I'll consider this a low to medium risk factor.\n\nReligious belief:\n\n- Believes God has something to do with personal events: Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism, but it's unclear in this context. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these assessments:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Low\n\n- Race: Medium\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: High\n\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\n- Marital status/living situation: Medium\n\n- Education level: High\n\n- Employment history: High\n\n- Substance abuse/mental health: High\n\n- Childhood environment: Medium\n\n- Religious belief: Low\n\nGiven these factors, the presence of multiple high-risk factors such as conviction history, lack of education, unemployment, and substance abuse strongly suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nConsidering the multitude of high-risk factors, I would estimate a confidence level of 85%.\n\nSo, the final JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"Being 21 is still in a higher-risk age range for recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic biases may affect outcomes for minority groups.\"),\n\n(\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction history increases recidivism risk.\"),\n\n(\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n\n(\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Low education levels correlate with higher recidivism due to limited opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases recidivism risk due to lack of structure and finances.\"),\n\n(\"substance_abuse_mental_health\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse and mental health issues are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Childhood environments can influence behavior, but this is more of a background factor.\"),\n\n(\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious belief may have a protective effect against recidivism.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
