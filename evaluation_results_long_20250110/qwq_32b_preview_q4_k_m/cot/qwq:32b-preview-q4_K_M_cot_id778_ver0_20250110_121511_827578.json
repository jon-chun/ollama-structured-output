    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female identified as White. Age and gender can be significant factors in recidivism rates. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but being female typically reduces this risk since women have lower recidivism rates than men. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested twice and has convictions. The number of arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. Two arrests with convictions suggest some level of involvement in crime. This would likely be a high-risk factor.\n\nHer physical attributes\u20145'5\" and 140 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk. Unless there's specific research indicating otherwise, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nMarital status: she's divorced and living alone. Marital status can influence recidivism; being married often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Divorced individuals might have higher risks, but this isn't always the case. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a well-known risk factor for recidivism, as it limits employment opportunities. This should be rated high.\n\nEmployment: held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to increased criminal activity due to lack of legitimate income sources. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use: no drug use in the past four years, but some down feelings in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, but since she hasn't used drugs recently, this might be low to medium. However, the emotional distress mentioned could indicate potential for future issues, so perhaps medium.\n\nEarly life: lived with biological mother in a household of size four in an urban area. Family structure can impact recidivism; growing up with both parents is generally better. Since she was with only her mother, this might be a medium risk. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, which could also influence risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes reduce recidivism by providing moral guidance and social support. This might be a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Low\n\n- Arrests/convictions: High\n\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\n- Marital status/living situation: Medium\n\n- Education: High\n\n- Employment: High\n\n- Drug use/mental health: Medium\n\n- Early family environment: Medium\n\n- Religious beliefs: Low\n\nConsidering these factors, particularly the high-risk ones like arrests/convictions, lack of education, and unemployment, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, some low-risk factors like gender and religious beliefs might slightly mitigate this risk.\n\nGiven the balance, I'll predict YES for rearrest within 3 years, with a confidence level around 75%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but being female decreases it.\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"Arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"History of arrests and convictions indicates higher risk.\"),\n\n(\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Divorced and living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n\n(\"Drug use/mental health\", \"medium\", \"No recent drug use, but emotional distress could be a factor.\"),\n\n(\"Early family environment\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household may influence risk.\"),\n\n(\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Potential positive impact on behavior.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
