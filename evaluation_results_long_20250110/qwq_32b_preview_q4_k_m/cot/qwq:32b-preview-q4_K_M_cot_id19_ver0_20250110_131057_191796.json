    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I've got this profile of an individual, and I need to assess the risk of him being rearrested within three years. I'm going to look at each piece of information provided and try to gauge how significant it is in terms of predicting recidivism.\n\nFirst up, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are both known predictors of criminal behavior. Young males are generally more prone to committing crimes, especially violent ones. So, being 20 years old and male probably puts him in a higher-risk category. But I need to consider how this intersects with other factors.\n\nNext, he's been arrested four times and has convictions. This is a pretty significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior. Research shows that prior convictions are one of the strongest predictors of future offending. So, this would likely be a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 6 inches, and he weighs 135 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism. Unless there's something specific about his build that might relate to his behavior, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can be a factor; married individuals often have lower rates of reoffending because of the stability and support marriage can provide. Living alone might also mean he lacks social supports that could help keep him on the straight and narrow. So, this could be a medium to high-risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. Having a high school diploma is better than no diploma, but not pursuing further education might indicate limited opportunities or motivation. This could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year. That's a lot of job turnover, which suggests instability in employment. Instability can lead to stress and potentially criminal behavior if someone feels they have no other options. This would likely be a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use is mentioned: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has been using them in the past month. He also reports feeling down and unmotivated. Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism. It can both lead to criminal behavior and result from it, creating a vicious cycle. His current mental state, indicated by feeling depressed, could also be a factor, as mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates. This combination would definitely be a high-risk factor.\n\nLooking back at his childhood, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Family structure can be important; living with both parents is generally considered protective against delinquency. However, this was in the past, and his current environment might be more relevant. Still, a stable family background could be seen as a low-risk factor, but it's hard to say definitively without more information.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual or religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against criminal behavior, providing a sense of purpose and morality. Lack of religiosity might remove that influence, potentially making recidivism more likely. This could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors:\n\n- Age and gender: high risk\n\n- Multiple arrests and convictions: high risk\n\n- Physical attributes: low risk\n\n- Marital status and living alone: high risk\n\n- Education level: medium risk\n\n- Job instability: high risk\n\n- Substance abuse and mental health issues: high risk\n\n- Stable family background: low risk\n\n- Lack of religiosity: medium risk\n\nOverall, the majority of these factors point towards a high risk of recidivism. The multiple arrests, convictions, job instability, substance abuse, and mental health issues are particularly concerning. The stable family background in childhood might offer some resilience, but given his current circumstances, it's likely not enough to counterbalance the other risks.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that there is a high probability of rearrest within three years. I would estimate this confidence at around 85%.\n\nSo, summarizing in the required format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age_and_gender\", \"high\", \"Young males have higher rates of criminal behavior.\"),\n\n(\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of offending.\"),\n\n(\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"high\", \"Unmarried and living alone may lack social supports.\"),\n\n(\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college suggests limited opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes indicate instability.\"),\n\n(\"substance_abuse_and_mental_health\", \"high\", \"Drug use and depression are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure in childhood may provide some resilience.\"),\n\n(\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious belief might remove a protective factor.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
