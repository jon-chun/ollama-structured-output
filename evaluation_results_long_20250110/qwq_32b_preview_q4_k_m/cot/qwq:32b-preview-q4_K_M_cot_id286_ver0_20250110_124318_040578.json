    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known predictors in criminal justice outcomes. Males are generally more likely to reoffend than females, and younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates. However, at 22, he's slightly older than the typical high-risk age group, which is usually late teens to early twenties. So, being 22 might\u7a0d\u5fae\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u70b9\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u79cd\u65cf\u65b9\u9762\uff0cWhite\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u518d\u72af\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u65cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6b67\u89c6\u3002\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests that either the charges were dropped, or he was found not guilty. This could indicate that the initial suspicion may not have held up in court, which might suggest a lower risk of reoffending for that particular incident. However, the fact that he was arrested indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity, even if not resulting in a conviction.\n\nHe is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 180 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight aren't typically considered strong predictors of recidivism. They don't directly relate to behavioral or social factors that influence reoffending. So, I'll classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can be a factor; being unmarried might be associated with higher recidivism rates, as marital bonds can provide stability and support. Living alone could also mean less social supervision or support, which might increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is a significant factor; higher education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates. Being enrolled in college suggests a commitment to personal development and a potential for better employment opportunities, which are protective factors against reoffending.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment history is important; stable employment can reduce the likelihood of reoffending by providing structure and a legitimate source of income. Holding two jobs might indicate a strong work ethic and financial stability, which are positive signs.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, but has not felt depressed over the past month. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to impaired judgment, legal issues, and social problems. Cocaine use is particularly concerning due to its higher potential for addiction and related criminal activity. However, the absence of depression symptoms recently is positive, as mental health issues can exacerbate the risks associated with substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than his biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size three, in an urban area. This suggests that he may have experienced some form of alternative caregiving, which could indicate family instability or other social issues. Growing up in an urban area can also expose individuals to higher crime rates and peer pressure, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing moral guidance and a support network through religious communities. This could mitigate some of the other risks he faces.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: Medium risk. Being a 22-year-old male places him in a group that has higher recidivism rates, but his slightly older age might offer some mitigation.\n\n2. **Arrest without Conviction**: Low risk. Since there was no conviction, the severity of the initial offense may have been low, or there was insufficient evidence.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: Low risk. Height and weight are not directly related to recidivism.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Medium risk. Unmarried and living alone could indicate less social support and stability.\n\n5. **Education Level**: Low risk. Being enrolled in college suggests positive personal development and future prospects.\n\n6. **Employment History**: Low risk. Holding two jobs indicates responsibility and financial stability.\n\n7. **Substance Abuse**: High risk. Use of cocaine and marijuana increases the likelihood of reoffending due to associated behavioral and legal risks.\n\n8. **Living Situation in Youth**: Medium risk. Alternative caregiving and urban upbringing could expose him to higher crime influences.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Low risk. Belief in God may provide moral guidance and support.\n\nConsidering these factors, the high-risk factor of substance abuse stands out, particularly given the use of cocaine, which is a potent drug associated with significant legal and social consequences. However, his current enrollment in college and stable employment suggest that he has positive aspects in his life that could counteract some of these risks.\n\nGiven this mix of risk and protective factors, I would predict a moderate likelihood of recidivism over the next three years. The substance abuse is a significant concern, but his educational and employment status provide substantial protection.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\nTo present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age and Gender\", \"medium\", \"Being a 22-year-old male places him in a group with higher recidivism rates, but his age slightly mitigates this risk.\"],\n    [\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"low\", \"No conviction suggests lesser involvement or dropped charges.\"],\n    [\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly related to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may indicate less social support.\"],\n    [\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college suggests positive personal development and future prospects.\"],\n    [\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates responsibility and financial stability.\"],\n    [\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of cocaine and marijuana increases the likelihood of reoffending due to associated risks.\"],\n    [\"Living Situation in Youth\", \"medium\", \"Alternative caregiving and urban upbringing may expose him to higher crime influences.\"],\n    [\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidance and support.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nI've rated the prediction as \"YES\" with a confidence of 60%, indicating a moderate likelihood of recidivism due to the presence of both significant risks and protective factors.\n",
