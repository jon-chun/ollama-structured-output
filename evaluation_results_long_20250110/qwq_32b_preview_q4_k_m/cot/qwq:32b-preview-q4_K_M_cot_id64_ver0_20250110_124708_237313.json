    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender are important factors in recidivism predictions. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males, and younger individuals may have higher tendencies due to impulsivity and lack of maturity. However, at 22, she's somewhat past the peak age for criminal behavior, which is typically in the late teens to early twenties.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once and convicted. This suggests that she has a criminal history, which is a significant risk factor. Even with only one conviction, having a criminal record can increase the likelihood of future offenses due to factors like stigmatization and limited opportunities.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014don't directly correlate with recidivism risk, so I'll consider these neutral.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk, as there might be less social support and stability. However, this isn't always the case, and many single individuals live crime-free lives.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; higher education typically reduces the likelihood of reoffending. So, not being in college could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nEmployment: She has held one job during the year. Stable employment is protective against recidivism. Holding a job suggests some level of stability and responsibility, which is positive.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, including marijuana, can be linked to higher recidivism rates, as drug use may contribute to criminal behavior or indicate underlying issues that could lead to reoffending.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not managed properly.\n\nFamily background: She lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. A stable family environment is generally protective against criminal behavior. Living with both parents is often associated with lower risks.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes that God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, which may reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Gender (Female)**: Low risk. Females typically have lower recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Age (22)**: Medium risk. She's slightly past the peak criminal age, but still young enough to be at some risk.\n\n3. **Criminal history (1 arrest, convicted)**: High risk. Any criminal history increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n4. **Living alone**: Medium risk. Less social support may increase risk.\n\n5. **Education (High school diploma, not in college)**: Medium risk. Not pursuing higher education could limit opportunities.\n\n6. **Employment (1 job in a year)**: Low risk. Having a job is positive.\n\n7. **Drug use (Marijuana in past four years)**: Medium risk. Substance use is associated with higher recidivism.\n\n8. **Mental health (No depression in past month)**: Low risk.\n\n9. **Family background (Both parents, urban, household of 4)**: Low risk.\n\n10. **Religious beliefs**: Low risk.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the high-risk factor of having a criminal history stands out. However, several low-risk factors, such as being female, employed, not currently depressed, coming from a stable family background, and holding religious beliefs, counterbalance this.\n\nGiven that she has only one conviction and is currently employed, with no recent mental health issues, I would predict a lower risk of recidivism over the next three years.\n\n**Prediction:** NO\n\n**Confidence:** 75%\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Slightly past peak criminal age but still young.\"],\n    [\"Criminal history (1 arrest, convicted)\", \"high\", \"Any criminal history increases risk.\"],\n    [\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Less social support may increase risk.\"],\n    [\"Education (High school diploma, not in college)\", \"medium\", \"Not pursuing higher education could limit opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Employment (1 job in a year)\", \"low\", \"Having a job is positive.\"],\n    [\"Drug use (Marijuana in past four years)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is associated with higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Mental health (No depression in past month)\", \"low\", \"No recent mental health issues.\"],\n    [\"Family background (Both parents, urban, household of 4)\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"],\n    [\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide moral guidance and support.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
