    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known predictors in criminal justice settings. Young males are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities. So, being 20 years old and male might indicate a higher risk. But I need to consider this in conjunction with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests don't necessarily lead to convictions, but multiple arrests could suggest a propensity for getting into situations that lead to police intervention. This might be a medium-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are given as 5 feet 11 inches and between 175 and 199 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism. So, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can be relevant. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. Being unmarried at a young age might not be as significant, but combined with living alone, it could suggest limited social anchors. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Lack of education can limit employment opportunities, leading to higher chances of reoffending. This is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because steady employment is associated with lower recidivism rates. Holding multiple jobs in a short period might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be medium risk.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced depressive symptoms in the past month. Substance use and mental health issues are both significant risk factors. Marijuana use, while illegal in many places, might not be as strongly correlated with recidivism as harder drugs, but it still indicates potential impulsivity or coping mechanisms that could lead to reoffending. The depressive symptoms are also concerning, as mental health issues can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. I'll consider both of these as medium-risk factors.\n\nLooking back at his childhood, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence future behavior. Living with only one parent might indicate less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor. Rural areas sometimes have different social dynamics and access to resources, but it's hard to generalize. I'll consider this a low to medium-risk factor.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs or lack thereof aren't typically direct predictors of recidivism in standard assessments, so I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age and gender: Medium risk\n\n- Arrest history without conviction: Medium risk\n\n- Physical attributes: Low risk\n\n- Marital status and living situation: Medium risk\n\n- Educational level: High risk\n\n- Employment stability: Medium risk\n\n- Substance use: Medium risk\n\n- Mental health symptoms: Medium risk\n\n- Upbringing: Medium risk\n\n- Spiritual beliefs: Low risk\n\nOverall, there are several medium-risk factors and one high-risk factor. The high-risk factor related to education is particularly concerning because education level has a strong correlation with employment opportunities and overall stability.\n\nGiven this profile, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. However, it's important to note that predictions are not deterministic, and individual circumstances can change over time.\n\nI'll assign a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism within three years, with a confidence level of, say, 70%. This takes into account the multiple medium-risk factors and the high-risk educational factor, while acknowledging that some factors are low risk and could potentially mitigate the overall risk.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Young male age is a known risk factor.\"),\n\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests without conviction suggest potential for future offenses.\"),\n\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits employment opportunities.\"),\n\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs in a year suggests instability.\"),\n\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use indicates potential impulsivity or coping mechanisms.\"),\n\n    (\"mental_health_symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Reported depressive symptoms are a concern.\"),\n\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household in rural area may have influenced social environment.\"),\n\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs about religion are not typically predictive of recidivism.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",
