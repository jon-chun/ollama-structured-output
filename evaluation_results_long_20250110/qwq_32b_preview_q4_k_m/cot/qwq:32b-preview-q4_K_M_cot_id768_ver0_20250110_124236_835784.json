    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's consider each piece of information provided and assign a relative weight to each risk factor.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female identifying as Hispanic. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior; younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal activities. However, being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested four times and has convictions. The number of prior arrests and convictions is a strong predictor of future offending. Four arrests suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, which would be a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches, and she weighs 180 lbs. Physical characteristics like weight don't typically correlate directly with recidivism. So, this would be a low-risk factor.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence behavior. Unmarried individuals and those living alone might have less social support, which could increase the risk of reoffending. This could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Having a high school diploma is better than no diploma, but not pursuing higher education might indicate limited opportunities, which could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nShe has held three jobs during the year. Employment stability is crucial. Holding multiple jobs in a short period might suggest instability, which could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine, and she has recently experienced depression. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism. Active drug use and depressive symptoms indicate potential challenges in maintaining lawful behavior, making this a high-risk factor.\n\nShe lived in a household of size six at a young age. Growing up in a large family might suggest a more chaotic home environment, which could be a medium-risk factor.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against reoffending. However, this is subjective, and its impact varies widely among individuals. I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old - Medium\n\n2. Gender: Female - Low\n\n3. Arrest history: 4 arrests with convictions - High\n\n4. Physical characteristics: 5'4\", 180 lbs. - Low\n\n5. Marital status and living situation: Never married, lives alone - Medium\n\n6. Education: High school diploma, not in college - Medium\n\n7. Employment: Held 3 jobs in a year - Medium\n\n8. Substance abuse and mental health: Drug use, recent depression - High\n\n9. Family environment: Grew up in a household of 6 - Medium\n\n10. Religious beliefs: Believes God influences personal events - Low\n\nConsidering these factors, particularly the high-risk factors of arrest history and substance abuse/mental health issues, along with several medium-risk factors, it suggests a\u8f83\u9ad8 risk of recidivism.\n\nHowever, some low-risk factors like being female and having religious beliefs might slightly mitigate this risk.\n\nGiven this balance, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within the next three years.\n\nLet's assign a confidence level. With multiple high-risk factors and only a few low-risk factors, I'll estimate a confidence of around 85%.\n\nSo, the prediction is \"YES\" with 85% confidence.\n\nNow, to structure this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but being female decreases it.\"),\n\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may lack social support.\"),\n\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive, but no higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs suggests instability.\"),\n\n    (\"Substance abuse and mental health\", \"high\", \"Active drug use and recent depression are significant risk factors.\"),\n\n    (\"Family environment\", \"medium\", \"Large household may indicate a chaotic upbringing.\"),\n\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God possibly acts as a protective factor.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nThere we have it.\n\n",
