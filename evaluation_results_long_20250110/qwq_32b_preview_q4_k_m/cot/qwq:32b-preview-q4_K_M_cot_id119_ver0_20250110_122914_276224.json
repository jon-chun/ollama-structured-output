    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known predictors in criminal justice settings. Young males tend to have higher rates of offending and recidivism compared to other demographics. So, being a young male likely increases the risk.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's possible that the arrest was unfounded or the charges were dropped. However, even an arrest can indicate some level of risky behavior.\n\nHe is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism. So, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living situation can be relevant; living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor. However, being unmarried at age 20 isn't unusual, so I need to weigh this carefully.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is generally protective against recidivism. Higher education often correlates with better job prospects and lower criminal involvement. So, this is a positive factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment history is important. Having a stable job can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. However, holding only one job in a year might not be sufficient to establish stability, especially if the job is part-time or temporary.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Cocaine use is particularly concerning due to its association with more serious criminal behavior and higher rates of addiction compared to marijuana.\n\nHe has not felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can be linked to higher recidivism rates, so the absence of recent depression is a plus.\n\nIn his childhood, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Family structure during upbringing can influence later behavior. Living with both biological parents is generally considered protective, but growing up in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual or religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing guidance and a sense of purpose.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age and Gender: High risk. Young males are statistically more likely to reoffend.\n\n2. Arrest history without conviction: Medium risk. Indicates some level of involvement with the law, but no conviction suggests perhaps minor or unsubstantiated issues.\n\n3. Physical attributes: Low risk. Height and weight aren't predictive of recidivism.\n\n4. Living situation: Medium risk. Living alone may lack social support, which can be a protective factor.\n\n5. Education level: Low risk. Being enrolled in college suggests positive future prospects and lower likelihood of reoffending.\n\n6. Employment history: Medium risk. Holding one job in a year might not indicate stability; more consistent employment would be better.\n\n7. Substance use: High risk. Use of cocaine, in particular, is a significant concern due to its association with criminal behavior and addiction.\n\n8. Mental health: Low risk. No recent depression is positive.\n\n9. Childhood family structure: Low risk. Living with both biological parents is protective.\n\n10. Religious beliefs: Low risk. Belief in God may provide moral guidance and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nConsidering these factors, the high-risk factors are age and gender, and substance use, particularly cocaine. The medium-risk factors are arrest history without conviction, living situation, and employment history. The low-risk factors include education level, mental health, childhood family structure, and religious beliefs.\n\nGiven that there are two high-risk factors and three medium-risk factors, with five low-risk factors, it suggests a mix of risks and protective factors. However, the presence of high-risk factors, especially substance use involving cocaine, is concerning.\n\nTo make a prediction, I need to weigh these factors. Assuming that high-risk factors carry more weight than medium or low, and considering that substance use is a significant predictor of recidivism, particularly with hard drugs like cocaine, I would lean towards predicting a higher risk of rearrest within three years.\n\nHowever, the protective factors, such as education and religious beliefs, might mitigate some of this risk. But given the strength of the high-risk factors, especially the substance use, I think it's more likely than not that this individual will be rearrested within three years.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"YES,\" with a confidence level of, say, 70%. This accounts for the presence of both risk and protective factors, with the risks perhaps slightly outweighing the protections.\n\nSo, the JSON object would look like this:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young males have higher rates of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Indicates some legal involvement, but no conviction.\"),\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not predictive of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack social support.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"College enrollment suggests positive future prospects.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"One job in a year may not indicate stability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"Use of cocaine is a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive.\"),\n    (\"Childhood family structure\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n",
