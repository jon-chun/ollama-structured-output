He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 168 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
