He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 195 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
