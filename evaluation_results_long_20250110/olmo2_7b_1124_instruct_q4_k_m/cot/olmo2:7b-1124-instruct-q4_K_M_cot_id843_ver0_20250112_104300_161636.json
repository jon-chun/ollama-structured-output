It assigns relative weights to each of the identified risk factors, considering their potential influence on the 3-year rearrest recidivism rate for the individual described. The prediction is that the person will reoffend within three years due to several high-risk factors present in his background and recent experiences. The confidence level is set at 78% to reflect the assessment's reliability based on standard risk assessment methodologies.",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
