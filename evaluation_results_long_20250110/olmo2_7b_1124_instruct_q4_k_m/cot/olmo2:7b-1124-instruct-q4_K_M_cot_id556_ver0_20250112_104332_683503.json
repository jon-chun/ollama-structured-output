It assigns relative weights to each factor considering their typical influence on recidivism rates among young males. Factors such as multiple arrests, prior convictions, and signs of depression are weighted more heavily due to their strong predictive value for reoffending. The prediction is \"YES\", indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. The confidence level is set at 75%, reflecting the analysis's strength but also acknowledging the complexity and variability inherent in predicting individual behavior.",
