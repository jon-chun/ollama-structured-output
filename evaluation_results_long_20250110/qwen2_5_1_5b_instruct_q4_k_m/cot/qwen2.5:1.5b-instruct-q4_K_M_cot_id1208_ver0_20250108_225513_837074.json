Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
