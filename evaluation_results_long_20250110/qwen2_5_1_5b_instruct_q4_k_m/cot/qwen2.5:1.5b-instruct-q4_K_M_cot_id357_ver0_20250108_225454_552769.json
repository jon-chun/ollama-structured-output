He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
