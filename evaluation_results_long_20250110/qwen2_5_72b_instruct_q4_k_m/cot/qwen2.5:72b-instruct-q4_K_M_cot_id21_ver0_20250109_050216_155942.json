He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4.
