    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the following considerations:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: Younger individuals, particularly females, tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to older males.\n\n2. **Arrest Record**: A single arrest without a conviction suggests that this person may not be deeply entrenched in criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Physical Description**: Height and weight do not typically correlate with criminal behavior or risk.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Being unmarried is common for someone of her age, and living alone does not directly indicate high risk.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Holding a high school diploma and having held two jobs in the past year suggests a level of stability and employability which can be associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: No drug use in four years indicates that substance abuse is likely not an issue.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Feeling down occasionally, without further information about severity or frequency, does not necessarily indicate high risk for criminal behavior. It's important but requires more context to assess accurately.\n\n8. **Family Background and Upbringing**: Living with biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area is fairly typical and does not inherently suggest a higher risk environment.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: A belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes may provide a moral compass and social support network, which can be protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\n**Confidence Level Explanation**:\nThe confidence level of 75% is based on the presence of several positive indicators such as stable employment history, educational attainment, no drug use, and some level of family stability. However, without more in-depth information about her mental health state, the exact nature of her single arrest, and specific details about her environment or social support network, a lower confidence level is warranted.",
