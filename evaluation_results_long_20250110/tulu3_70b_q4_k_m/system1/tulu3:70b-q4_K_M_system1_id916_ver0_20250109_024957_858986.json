While drug use, particularly of substances like cocaine, can be a significant risk factor, other elements such as education level (completion of an associate degree), employment history, age, and lack of prior convictions suggest a lower likelihood of high-risk behavior.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this analysis does not account for the complexity of individual cases or the myriad factors that could influence someone's behavior. It also assumes that the arrest did not result in charges serious enough to warrant concern and focuses on statistical probabilities rather than specific case details which might alter the assessment significantly.\n\nThe confidence level reflects a balance between the identified risk factors (e.g., drug use) and mitigating factors (education, employment). Further information or a more comprehensive assessment tool could provide a clearer picture of this individual's risk profile.",
