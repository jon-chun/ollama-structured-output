    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nHere is the reasoning behind this response:\n\n1. **Age**: At 21, he is still relatively young but not in the highest-risk age group (typically late teens to early 20s).\n\n2. **Gender and Race**: While being male often correlates with higher risk, there's insufficient data to evaluate racial factors in isolation.\n\n3. **Arrest and Conviction History**: He has been arrested once and convicted; this is a red flag but not extremely high given the singular nature of the arrest/conviction.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight do not typically correlate with criminal risk.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Single, living alone could suggest fewer social ties or support networks, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\n6. **Education**: Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests motivation towards betterment and potentially lower risk.\n\n7. **Employment History**: No jobs during the year may indicate instability or lack of structure, but without knowing more about his student status (full-time vs part-time), this is not definitive.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: Past marijuana use alone does not necessarily elevate risk significantly, especially given its increasingly accepted legal status in many areas.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests that mental health may not be a current risk factor.\n\n10. **Family Background**: Coming from a smaller household with his biological mother could imply a stable upbringing, potentially reducing risk.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: His personal belief about God's role in his life is generally neutral and unlikely to significantly impact criminal risk assessment.\n\nOverall, while there are some concerning factors (arrest history, lack of employment), the presence of mitigating ones (education, mental health status) lowers the immediate risk level. However, this determination should be taken with caution as it does not include all possible data points that could influence a comprehensive risk assessment in real-world settings.",
