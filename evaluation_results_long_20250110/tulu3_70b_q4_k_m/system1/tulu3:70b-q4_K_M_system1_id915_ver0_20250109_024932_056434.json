    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThis response is based on the following considerations:\n\n- **Age**: Being young (21 years old) can be associated with higher risk due to less life experience and maturity, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n  \n- **Gender & Race**: Female gender tends to have lower recidivism rates compared to males. Race (Black) is not a predictive factor in itself; however, there might be systemic biases that could affect her life circumstances.\n\n- **Arrest History**: One arrest without conviction suggests the possibility of being stopped for minor offenses or being caught once but not having sufficient evidence to convict.\n\n- **Physical Attributes**: Height and weight do not typically indicate risk unless they are extreme enough to affect mobility or health in a way relevant to criminal behavior.\n\n- **Marital Status & Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone can suggest less social support, which might increase the risk of engaging in negative behaviors. However, it also could mean independence and self-sufficiency.\n\n- **Education**: Having a high school diploma but not being enrolled in college suggests some education but potentially limited opportunities or motivation for advancement.\n\n- **Employment Status**: No jobs held during the year indicates financial instability which can be correlated with increased risk of crime. However, it's also possible she is unemployed due to other reasons such as pursuing personal interests or taking care of a family member.\n\n- **Drug Use**: Past marijuana use is not an uncommon behavior and in some jurisdictions, might not even be illegal. However, any drug use could indicate a propensity for addictive behaviors which can correlate with higher risk.\n\n- **Mental Health**: Feeling down periodically indicates potential mental health concerns that, if unaddressed, could increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior or crime.\n\n- **Upbringing**: Living in a large family and rural area might suggest limited resources growing up, but not necessarily high criminal risk. \n\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Not believing God has influence over personal matters does not inherently indicate higher risk.\n\n**Final Assessment**: Based on the provided factors, there is insufficient evidence to strongly predict this individual poses a high criminal justice risk. The confidence level of 65% reflects that while some risk indicators are present (e.g., unemployment and drug use), they do not conclusively suggest a significant likelihood of reoffending or engaging in criminal behavior.",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
