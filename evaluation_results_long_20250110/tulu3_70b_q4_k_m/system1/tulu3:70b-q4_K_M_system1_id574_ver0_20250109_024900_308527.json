    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nHere's the rationale behind this response:\n\n- **Demographics and Personal History**: The individual is a young, educated female with no prior convictions. While being arrested once could indicate some risk, it does not necessarily mean she will reoffend without conviction.\n\n- **Education and Employment Status**: She has completed high school and is currently enrolled in college, indicating commitment to education which generally correlates with lower criminal risk.\n\n- **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) introduces a risk factor, but it's not recent or severe enough (based on provided details) to predict a high likelihood of future offending. Substance use can be a significant risk factor if it is ongoing or associated with other risky behaviors like crime.\n\n- **Mental Health**: The absence of reported depression in the past month suggests that she may currently have good mental health, which typically correlates with lower risk.\n\n- **Social Environment and Living Situation**: She lived in an urban area with her biological mother, indicating a relatively stable family background. Currently living alone might suggest independence but could also imply isolation or lack of social support networks.\n\n- **Religious Beliefs**: The belief that God influences personal events can often be associated with lower risk due to potential moral guidance and community support provided by religious involvement.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high criminal justice risk. However, this assessment has a confidence level of 75%, recognizing that while many factors suggest low risk, there are still some uncertainties (such as drug use history) which could alter her risk profile over time.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
