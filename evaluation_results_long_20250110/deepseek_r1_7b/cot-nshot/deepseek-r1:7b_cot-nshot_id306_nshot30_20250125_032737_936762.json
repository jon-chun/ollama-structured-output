    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female, White, arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'5\" and weighs 127 lbs, which seems quite skinny\u2014maybe anemic? Not sure if that's relevant here. She's never married and living alone. She's enrolled in school, so education is ongoing. She held one job during the year, which might be a positive sign as employment can reduce recidivism.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because drug use is a known risk factor for rearrest. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently suggests maybe she's trying to get better, but past use could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nHousehold at age young: She lived with both parents in a household of five. This might suggest she had a supportive environment as a child, which is usually protective against recidivism, so maybe not a strong risk factor here.\n\nBelieves God has no role: Her spirituality might be a protective factor if it's used to cope with stress or provide guidance, but since she doesn't see a direct impact on her personal issues, maybe this isn't as relevant.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided. Most of them have various factors like age, weight, arrests, education, employment, drug use, household size, and religion.\n\nIn example 10, someone with similar factors (aged 25+, arrested multiple times, weight issues, no school, employed, etc.) had a high recidivism rate, but that's not directly applicable here because of age differences.\n\nLooking at the case in question: She was arrested once, which is significant. Her drug use might be a red flag despite recent feelings of depression. Being alone and living with both parents could have protective effects if she's stable now, but past issues are still present.\n\nHer being enrolled in school suggests she's proactive about her future, maybe seeking better opportunities or learning skills that can help avoid incarceration.\n\nConsidering the low weight might affect her physical health, which could influence employment or other aspects of her life. But since she's enrolled in school and held a job before, this might mitigate some health concerns.\n\nReligion: Her belief in God not affecting personal issues might mean she's focused on other areas, but that doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it aids in coping.\n\nSo weighing each factor:\n\nAge: 19 is young, which can be protective if she's actively working towards betterment.\nWeight: 127 lbs\u2014possibly anemic or in poor health, could impact job prospects.\nArrests: One but not convicted. If she had a conviction, it would be more concerning.\nEmployment: Had one job and is currently enrolled in school. Positive signs.\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine\u2014moderate risk of relapse despite recent feelings.\nHousehold at age young: lived with both parents, which could have been supportive but now living alone\u2014maybe less support now.\nReligion: No direct impact on recidivism as per her statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors are past drug use and current arrest. The other factors like employment and household might slightly reduce risk, but the presence of drug use is a strong indicator of potential issues.\n\nI'd assign high weight to drug use because it's a direct risk factor. Medium to age-related factors if they positively impact her situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Age: 19 years old, which is young and may indicate proactive steps toward betterment but not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Weight: 127 lbs\u2014possibly anemic or in poor health, which could impact job prospects but she is enrolled in school and had a previous job.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest but not convicted.
