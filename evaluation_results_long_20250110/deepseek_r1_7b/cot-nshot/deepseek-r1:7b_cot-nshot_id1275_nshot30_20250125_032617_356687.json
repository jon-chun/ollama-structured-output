    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant risk factor indicating past criminal behavior. That should be a high weight because prior convictions are strong indicators of future criminal activity.\n\nShe's Hispanic, but I don't see any examples provided for this race, so maybe the weight isn't as high here compared to other factors like education or living situation.\n\nHer height and weight aren't particularly concerning, so no issues there. She's never been married and is living alone, which might suggest she's not in a supportive environment, possibly increasing her risk.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED certificate, meaning she didn't complete basic education. Not having a diploma could impact her ability to find stable employment, which often leads to reoffending. So this should be a medium-high weight factor.\n\nNot being enrolled in college is another point. Educational attainment can help reduce recidivism because it provides opportunities for better job prospects and life skills. Without education, she might face barriers leading to rearrest.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year, which isn't a lot of work experience. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it limits economic stability and opportunities for positive changes in her life.\n\nHer substance use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse can have serious consequences, including health issues that might affect her ability to reintegrate into society or face legal issues again. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, but past drug use sometimes leads to mental health issues which could contribute to further problems. However, since she's not currently depressed, maybe the immediate risk isn't as high, but the history still matters.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of three might be okay, but family support can play a role in helping her avoid further trouble. However, without other strong support systems, it's a medium factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014prior conviction, lack of education, joblessness, and drug use\u2014the risk is quite high for rearrest. The examples given show that individuals with similar risk factors tend to have higher recidivism rates, especially when they've been convicted before.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, indicating past criminal behavior which significantly increases the likelihood of future rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED certificate can impact job prospects and overall stability, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"She has held only one job during the year, which may limit economic stability and opportunities for positive changes in her life.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years can have serious consequences and increase the risk of further legal issues or health complications.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with a biological mother in a household of three may provide some support but doesn't guarantee protection from future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
