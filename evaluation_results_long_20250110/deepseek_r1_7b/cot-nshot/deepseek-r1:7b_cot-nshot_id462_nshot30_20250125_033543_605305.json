    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is relatively young but not too concerning unless there are other factors like being out of school or having a lot of prior offenses. He's white, arrested twice without a conviction, and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's underweight for his height, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which is fine in itself but could indicate limited support network. Having a GED and not enrolled in college\u2014ged can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if education is seen as a positive step, but maybe it's a mitigating factor here since he's not continuing his education.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs during the year; job experience might be viewed positively for stability, but two jobs are good. He used marijuana and felt down recently\u2014drug use can increase recidivism risk if it's frequent or severe. Feeling low sometimes could indicate other stressors or substance issues contributing to his behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area of size 4\u2014the household size might influence supportiveness, but since he's never been married, maybe the environment is okay. Believing in God as a factor\u2014does that help? Maybe cultural factors play a role here, but it's hard to quantify.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some mitigating factors like no prior conviction and GED, which are positive. However, recent drug use and feelings of low mood could be significant risk factors. The living situation isn't terrible but doesn't add much either. Considering the examples provided, people with substance issues often have higher recidivism rates even if they've completed some education or had good job experiences.\n\nSo, I would say his overall risk is medium because he has a few factors that could predict a yes outcome for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"19 years old may be considered at an early stage of life, which might be mitigated by positive steps like having a GED and job experience.
