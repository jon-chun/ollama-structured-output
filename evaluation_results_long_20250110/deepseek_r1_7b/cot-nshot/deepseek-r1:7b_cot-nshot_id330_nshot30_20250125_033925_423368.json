    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this specific case. The person is an 18-year-old female who's White, not convicted yet after one arrest, weighs between 125-149 lbs, never married and not living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, held one job, used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. She lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area and believes God isn't involved in her life.\n\nFirst, I'll list the risk factors from the previous examples to see how they apply here. Looking at the provided data:\n\n1. Age: 18 years old. Young age might be a risk factor for recidivism as younger individuals often have less life experience.\n2. Education: No diploma or GED. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations and higher chances of reoffending.\n3. Employment: Held only one job. Unemployment or underemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n4. Drug use:Marijuana use but no cocaine or other substances mentioned. Even simple drug use can increase risk.\n5. Previous Arrests: One non-convicted arrest. A history of arrests, even if not convicted, can signal potential for future offenses.\n6. Household Size: Lives with two parents in a household of five. Larger households might offer more support but could also be associated with higher risk if unstable.\n7. Living Alone: Currently not living alone. Living with family can provide stability and reduce stressors.\n8. Marital Status: Never married, which is neutral here as it's not directly tied to recidivism unless considering other factors like economic dependency.\n\nNow assigning weights based on these factors:\n\n- Age (18): High risk due to youth exposure and potential lack of life experience leading to poor decision-making.\n- Education: High risk because without education, future opportunities are limited, increasing the chance of engaging in risky behaviors.\n- Employment: Medium to high. Unemployment can lead to stress and substance use, both linked to recidivism.\n- Drug Use (Marijuana): Medium risk as it's a minor drug but still associated with potential behavioral issues.\n- Previous Arrests (1 non-convicted): Medium risk since prior legal issues often indicate impulsive behavior or lack of responsibility.\n- Household Size (5): Medium, because while living with family is good, larger households might not always be stable, especially if living together without proper support.\n- Marital Status: Not directly affecting here as she's never married; maybe a neutral factor unless considering social isolation.\n\nConsidering her belief in God, which is a strong factor against recidivism. She's in an urban area, which might offer better resources and less exposure to crime compared to rural areas.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, education, employment status, previous arrest, household size, and drug use. Medium risks include living with parents but not alone and her belief in God.\n\nCombining these, the overall risk is high because several critical factors point towards higher likelihood of recidivism despite some mitigating factors like living with parents and religious belief.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"18 years old indicates youth exposure which may lead to poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED limits opportunities, increasing risk of risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Hold only one job; unemployment or underemployment can signal instability and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use may correlate with behavioral issues but not severe dependence.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest suggests potential for impulsive behavior or lack of responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Living with two parents in a household of five may offer some support, but larger households can be unstable.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married; no direct impact here unless considering economic dependency.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
