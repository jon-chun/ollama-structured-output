    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their profile. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. His race doesn't immediately suggest a high risk, but it's worth noting since there might be stereotypes or biases involved, though I shouldn't jump to conclusions.\n\nHe has been arrested two times but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a bit of a red flag because being arrested multiple times can indicate potential issues with law enforcement or prior problematic behavior. However, not being convicted might mean he's managed to avoid serious trouble so far.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and his weight is between 175-199 lbs, which places him in the taller and heavier categories. I'm not sure if this directly affects risk assessment unless it relates to other factors like substance use or health issues.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which might suggest he's more independent but could also mean higher stress levels or isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse as mentioned.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. That could mean he's facing educational challenges, possibly leading him to engage in risky behaviors like drug use as a substitute for academic success.\n\nHaving held three jobs during the year might indicate some adaptability, but it also suggests potential instability if his employment is inconsistent or insecure.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for most of the last month. Persistent substance use can have negative psychological effects and may contribute to behavioral issues or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area at a young age might suggest early-life stress or environmental factors that could impact his development, potentially leading to behavioral problems later on.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which can affect his personal motivations and cope mechanisms. This might influence his decision-making regarding risky behaviors since he may not rely on religious guidance for support or accountability.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: two arrests without convictions, substance use (marijuana), living situation with a biological mother in a household of three in rural areas, lack of education, current unemployment status, and disbelief in God. These points collectively suggest that this individual is at a higher risk compared to the average population.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
