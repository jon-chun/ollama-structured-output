    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male from Black background. Age 19 might mean he's still developing skills and hasn't had much life experience yet. His race could influence his opportunities but at this young age, it might not be as significant.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's one misdemeanor, which can affect his record, but since it's a non-conviction, maybe it doesn't have a big impact on future risk. Maybe the focus should be more on his current behaviors rather than past legal issues he couldn't resolve.\n\nHe is 5'4\" and 170 lbs. No information here about whether this affects his behavior or likelihood of engaging in risky activities. Maybe body type isn't directly predictive unless there's something else, but I don't see it here.\n\nNot married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because he might not have the same level of support as someone with family around him. It could also indicate that he's more responsible or independent, which might lower risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is important; having a diploma means he has some skills but maybe limited opportunities compared to higher education. Not being enrolled in college suggests he may have other priorities or needs.\n\nNo job during the year. Unemployment can be risky as it might lead to financial instability, substance abuse, or other negative behaviors if not addressed. Joblessness could increase risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and isn't depressed over a month. These are positive indicators of self-control and good mental health, which usually reduce the risk of engaging in harmful activities.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two in a rural area. That might mean less supervision or different living conditions compared to others, but it could also indicate family stability if he's close with them. Being raised by one parent might offer more independence.\n\nBelieves in God and feels something from Him. Religious affiliation can be protective as it often provides guidance and support, which might mitigate risk factors like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: one misdemeanor arrest isn't a conviction, so maybe not a significant factor here. He's young, which is generally protective. His living situation with his mother in a small rural household suggests he has some family support. His positive behaviors (no drugs, no depression) and lack of job are also protective.\n\nHowever, being 19 could mean he still doesn't have life experience that might contribute to risk factors like impulsivity or substance use if not monitored. But since he hasn't used drugs recently and is in good mental health, maybe those negatives aren't present here.\n\nI think the positive factors outweigh any potential risks, so his risk level isn't high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
