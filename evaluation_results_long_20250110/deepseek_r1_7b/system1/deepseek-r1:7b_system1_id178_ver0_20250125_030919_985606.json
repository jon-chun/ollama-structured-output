    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their background and circumstances.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor step by step:\n\n1. **Age and Race**: The person is 20, male, Black. His race can sometimes be associated with certain risk factors, but without specific data, it's hard to quantify that effect.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: He has been arrested 8 times and convicted. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of criminal history, which typically increases the risk of reoffending.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight don't immediately suggest a high risk unless they indicate underweight or being anemic, but there's no information on that here.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: He is unmarried and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which might mitigate some risks but isn't directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational instability often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can lack life skills and support.\n\n6. **Employment History**: He's held only two jobs during the year, which is limited experience. Unstable employment is linked to substance abuse and other risk factors.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine), with recent heavy use in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for various crimes and poor outcomes.\n\n8. **Past Experience and Mental Health**: At a young age, he lived alone with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. This suggests a complex family environment which might have had negative impacts on his development or mental health. Additionally, he feels very down during the past month, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: He believes in God affecting his personal life. While religious factors can influence behavior, they don't inherently increase risk unless there's evidence of sin or neglecting faith practices.\n\nPutting it all together: The multiple arrests and convictions are red flags. His lack of education and employment ties him to higher instability. Drug use is a major concern, as substance abuse often correlates with criminal activity and poor life choices. His family background in an urban setting with seven people could indicate potential neglect or environment issues that might contribute to risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it's highly likely he has a high risk of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior. Therefore, the prediction should be \"YES\" with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
