    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on his background and circumstances. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not be directly predictive but could influence other factors like social networks or community ties. Since he's relatively young, maybe that's less concerning in terms of risk, unless there are other red flags.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate past behavior issues; however, each arrest should be evaluated for the nature of the offense. If they're minor offenses, it might not carry as much weight compared to more severe ones. Since he's now convicted, that suggests a history of lawful conduct leading to legal consequences.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 3 inches and he weighs 190 lbs. That makes him pretty tall and heavy. The correlation between body type and criminal behavior isn't direct but could be related to other factors like alcohol or drug use if not accounted for. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of substance use.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can affect stress levels and social support, both of which influence recidivism risk. Alone living might lead to higher stress, but again, this depends on other factors like his current circumstances or job stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism risks when it's completed within the legal system. However, sometimes individuals use education as a tool for furtherance of criminal activities, so that needs to be considered carefully.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment history can indicate stability and financial independence. Employed individuals often have better support systems, which might reduce risk factors compared to those unemployed.\n\nThe last four years: no drug use, not depressed over a month. These are positive traits that suggest lower risk of engaging in dangerous or self-harming behaviors.\n\nHe lived with adults other than biological parents at an early age in a household of size 4 in an urban area. That might provide some support but could also imply exposure to certain environments if negative, although the context isn't clear here.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life. This lack of religious involvement can sometimes be linked to increased risk behaviors like substance abuse or delinquency, especially without religious guidance or support in those areas.\n\nPutting it all together: He's relatively young, with a clean drug history, stable employment and living situation, but has a prior conviction which could indicate past behavior issues. His lack of religion might be an indicator of risk-related beliefs that could influence his behavior. The prior arrest should be evaluated to see if it was for serious offenses or minor ones.\n\nConsidering all factors: He has some positive attributes like education, stable job, and living alone, but also has a previous conviction which raises concern. Without more context on the nature of his past convictions or any specific behavioral issues, it's hard to definitively say he's high risk. However, given that he was convicted before, which is significant, I might lean towards high risk despite some mitigating factors.\n\nI think my confidence level should be moderate because while there are positive signs, the prior conviction and potential underlying issues from that could indicate higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nThis prediction suggests a high risk with a confidence of 70%, considering the prior legal history despite other mitigating factors like education, stable living situation, and positive recent behavior.",
