    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing these risk factors for a potential high-risk individual based on my training as an expert criminal justice risk assessment tool. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male with one arrest and no conviction. His lack of prior convictions might reduce immediate risk since he hasn't landed in jail yet. However, his age being 21 suggests he's still developing life skills, which could be both a strength and a point of concern if he's not making positive choices.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches tall. While height isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, it might influence how people interact with him or potential employers. Since he's not described as having any physical issues related to his stature, I don't see a high risk there.\n\n living alone is another point. Living independently can be associated with higher self-reliance, which might correlate with lower risk compared to those in group housing where they rely more on others for support or safety.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't attending college. Educational barriers often indicate limited opportunities and could potentially lead to involvement in the criminal justice system due to lack of skills or knowledge about the law. This could be a red flag, increasing risk.\n\nHolding only one job might suggest stability, but if that job is not a productive one leading to substance abuse, it could affect his ability to maintain a steady life and contribute positively to society.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana over the past four years raises a concern. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or decisions that may have contributed to prior arrest. Plus, if he's using drugs now, it might increase the likelihood of further substance-related issues or even new offenses.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month is interesting. While not experiencing depression isn't necessarily a positive indicator, without context on his mental health history, it's hard to gauge whether this could change. However, chronic stress from past experiences might manifest differently than symptoms like depression.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of six in a rural area suggests he experienced a sheltered environment which is often protective against many negative influences but can also provide limited exposure to risk factors present in more diverse or urban settings. Being in such an environment could have both protective and risk aspects, depending on the broader context.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his behavior towards positive outcomes, as spirituality can offer guidance and help in making better choices. However, it's not a guarantee of no negative behaviors; everyone has their own beliefs and how they translate into actions varies widely.\n\nPutting all these together: the lack of prior convictions is a mitigating factor, but the absence of education, limited employment, potential substance abuse, and living environment that might limit exposure to risk factors could contribute to higher risk. The single arrest doesn't immediately point towards high recidivism if addressed properly. However, given the other factors like no GED, job status, and drug use history, I'm leaning towards a moderate to higher risk but not extremely high.\n\nConsidering all these points, my confidence is around 58%. This suggests that while there are mitigating factors, several risk indicators point towards needing closer monitoring or intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
