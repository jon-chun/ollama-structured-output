    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a solid red flag because prior convictions increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly influence recidivism risk in this context, so maybe it's not too impactful here.\n\nLiving alone is interesting. Young people living alone can sometimes experience higher stress or loneliness, which might affect their mental health and ability to cope with issues, potentially leading to more substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is attending college. Education seems positive, especially since he's completing his degree, which could contribute to better job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe's worked three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs shows good financial management and work ethic, which are usually protective factors against recidivism.\n\nDrug use history: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years, but it hasn't been severe recently. The recent mood issues might be related to other stressors or mental health issues, which could be contributing factors.\n\nYoung age at home with both parents when he was young\u2014maybe living with three people created some instability, especially if he's experiencing emotional challenges now, which could tie back to his current feelings of low mood.\n\nHis belief in God suggests a level of spirituality that might provide coping mechanisms, but it doesn't directly affect recidivism risk. However, it's worth noting as part of the background factors.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest and living situation are more concerning than the positive aspects like education and job stability. The drug use history is there, but recent issues might be due to other stressors. His belief in God isn't a risk factor either way. So overall, I think he's at a medium risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction which increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may contribute to stress or instability, though it does not directly indicate a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While there is a history of drug use in the past four years, recent issues might be related to other stressors rather than a direct increase in risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and Stability\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college can positively influence job opportunities and financial stability, which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Employing three jobs in the past year suggests good financial management and work ethic, which are protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"low\", \"Feeling down for extended periods could be related to other stressors but does not directly indicate a high risk of substance use or reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
