    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this risk assessment query for a 22-year-old female. She's White, has one arrest but no conviction, weighs between 150-174 lbs at 5'3\". Not married and not living alone. Has a GED and isn't in college. Worked four jobs in the past year, hasn't used drugs for four years. She felt really down recently and thinks God is involved with her life. Also, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out each risk factor's weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014and then predict if there's a 3-year rearrest recidivism chance, along with confidence.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Arrests**: She has one arrest but no conviction. That could be a red flag because even if it's not a conviction, it shows she's been involved in the system. Medium risk? Maybe medium since one incident isn't severe but does indicate past issues.\n\n2. **No College**: Having a GED and not attending college might mean she has some educational background but lacks formal credentials. This could be a negative factor because education can lead to better job opportunities, which are linked to lower recidivism. Medium risk here too.\n\n3. **Jobs**: She's held four jobs in the past year. Stability at work is usually positive for reducing recidivism. So low risk from employment history.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: No use for four years is great. Low risk since substance abuse is a major driver of recidivism.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: She felt very down recently, which might indicate some mental health issues or stressors. High risk here because untreated mental health can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: Lived with her mother in a household of three urban setting. Shared environments can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to lack of supervision or family issues. Maybe medium risk, depending on the dynamics.\n\n7. **God Influence**: She believes God is involved, which is generally positive as it suggests spiritual guidance. Low risk here.\n\nPutting this all together: The high risk factors are her recent mental health and living situation in a household with her mother. The other factors don't outweigh these negatives. So, I'd lean towards high risk for recidivism. Her low-level education might not be enough to offset the higher risks from past issues and current living conditions.\n\nPrediction is YES, high confidence because despite some mitigating factors like employment and education, the positive factors (mental health) and negative ones (past arrest, family living situation) balance out towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but no conviction, which could indicate past involvement in the criminal system.
