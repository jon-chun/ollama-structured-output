    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old female having recidivism within three years. She's Hispanic, but I don't know if that's a significant factor here. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has one arrest but no conviction. That alone might not be too bad because she hasn't been convicted yet. But then again, if she's still in custody and facing supervision issues, that could increase the risk.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 160 lbs. I don't think height or weight usually play a big role in recidivism unless there's something about her behavior related to those stats, which I don't see here.\n\nNever married and living alone isn't great, but again, it might not directly affect her risk if she has no criminal history beyond the one arrest. But living on her own could indicate she's independent or maybe struggling, which could be a red flag for other issues she might have.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means she didn't graduate, which is a negative factor because educational attainment can predict recidivism rates. People without degrees are more likely to end up in trouble again.\n\nShe has three jobs in the past year. That seems positive because having stable employment lowers the chance of engaging in illegal activities. But sometimes job instability can lead to other issues, so I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nNot using drugs for four years and feeling down sometimes might relate to mental health or substance abuse issues, which could be risk factors if they're leading her astray.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. That's a bigger family, but again, unless there were issues like neglect or abuse, it might not directly impact her current recidivism risk. However, family dynamics can influence behavior later on.\n\nConsidering that God is something important to her\u2014maybe she has strong moral values, which could be protective rather than harmful. But if those values are leading her astray because of past negative influences, then maybe not so much.\n\nNow, putting it all together: She has a minor conviction history but no full conviction. Her education level is a big risk factor. She's jobless in some sense (no diploma and working three jobs), which might be stable but could also indicate underlying issues. Her living situation alone isn't great but not directly linked to recidivism unless there's more to it.\n\nI think the main factors here are her lack of education, the prior arrest without conviction, and maybe her mental health or substance use. The rest seems less impactful. So overall, she might have a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which could indicate potential for future offenses despite lack of full accountability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Her lack of high school diploma or GED significantly increases the risk of recidivism as educational attainment is a key predictor of successful reintegration and reduced crime rates.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate independence, but in this case, it may suggest potential issues with social support that could influence her behavior or decision-making.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Having held three jobs might suggest stability, but job instability can also lead to other challenges that might contribute to recidivism if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years is a positive sign, reducing the risk of drug-related offenses.
