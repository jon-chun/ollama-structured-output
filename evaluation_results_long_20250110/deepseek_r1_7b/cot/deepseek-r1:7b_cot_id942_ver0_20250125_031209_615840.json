    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 20-year-old male and asked for a JSON response assigning relative weights to each risk factor and predicting rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each factor step by step. The individual is White, which might indicate higher risk due to potential racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, it's a bit tricky. His past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the last four years is significant because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's living alone without a family, which can contribute to isolation and substance abuse issues. His education level at high school diploma but not college might mean limited opportunities or higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors. Working two jobs could add stress but might also indicate responsible behavior unless it's related to substance use.\n\nHis past household experience with both biological parents suggests a stable environment initially, which is positive, but he's now living alone, so the environment has changed. Believing in God for guidance might provide some personal support and structure, which isn't directly a risk factor but could influence his behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are no red flags indicating immediate danger, several factors lean towards medium to high risk. His past substance use, lack of education, working two jobs (which might indicate stress), and living situation alone suggest he's at moderate to higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which is generally considered a low risk age for recidivism as they are still developing life skills and are more likely to conform to societal norms.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"The individual has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for substance abuse and potential criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"), \n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"The individual is currently living alone, which can lead to isolation and increased stress, potentially contributing to substance abuse or other risky behaviors that may result in recidivism.\"), \n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"The individual has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college.
