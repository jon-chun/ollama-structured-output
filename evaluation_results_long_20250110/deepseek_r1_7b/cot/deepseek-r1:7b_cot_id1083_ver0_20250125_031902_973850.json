Age-wise, he's just entered his late twenties, but being a first-time offender doesn't excuse past mistakes.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs, so that might indicate some health issues or maybe substance use problems like marijuana, as mentioned. He hasn't married anyone, is living alone, which could mean he's not getting support. No high school diploma or GED means he didn't finish his education, possibly leading to unstable life choices.\n\nNo job experience during the year suggests he might not have many opportunities and could end up relying on illegal activities again. His drug use in the past four years adds another layer of risk\u2014he's already struggling with substance abuse.\n\nHe lived alone at a young age when his household size was 11, which implies he experienced a lot of stress or neglect as a child. Believing in God might provide some moral support but doesn't necessarily protect him from recidivism if other factors are negative.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, no education, substance use, living alone, and a history of neglect. These factors point towards high risk. The model would predict YES with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of two arrests and convictions, indicating past criminal behavior which is a significant indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which can impair judgment, social responsibility, and job opportunities, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED despite being 21 suggests he may not have the necessary skills for stable employment or effective parenting.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can isolate him and reduce access to support, potentially increasing vulnerability to stressors or substance use which may lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"No Job Experience\", \"high\", \"The absence of any job during the past year indicates a lack of financial stability and potential exposure to economic pressures that could deter him from engaging in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Past Household Size at Age 11\", \"medium\", \"Living with 10 other people at such a young age may have exposed him to stress, neglect, or environments conducive to criminal behavior which can persist into adulthood.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"While his belief in God may provide some moral guidance, it does not directly mitigate the long-term risk of substance use and past criminal history.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
