    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help this user who's a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They need me to assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, high\u2014to each risk factor for an 18-year-old male to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- **Age**: 18, White.\n- **Arrests**: 1 time, not convicted.\n- **Physical characteristics**: 6'0\", 220 lbs. (No info on BMI, but weight is high.)\n- **Marital status**: Never married, living alone.\n- **Education**: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n- **Employment**: Held 3 jobs in the past year.\n- **Drug use**: No drugs in past four years.\n- **Mental health**: Not felt depressed in past month.\n- **Upbringing**: At young age lived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. Believes God has something to do with his life.\n\nOkay, starting with the factors:\n\n1. **Age and Upbringing**: Being 18 is often associated with higher recidivism because there's more time to learn and make mistakes. Living with four family members might indicate a stable environment initially but could also be at risk if family dynamics change. Urban area might offer more opportunities, but it could also mean higher stress.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: No recent drug use is positive. Many studies show that drug abuse significantly increases recidivism rates after treatment.\n\n3. **Employment History**: Employed 3 jobs in a year\u2014this is a good sign. Employment can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\n4. **Education Level**: High school diploma, not college\u2014which might limit opportunities but also could mean less exposure to more advanced or risky environments.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Not married living alone doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed in the past month\u2014good sign. Positive mental health is linked to lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- The high school diploma and job history are positive indicators but maybe not enough on their own.\n- No drug use is a strong mitigating factor.\n- Age might be a consideration, but since he's already employed and stable in his living situation, the risk isn't too high.\n- Considering all these factors, I think there's a low to medium chance of rearrest within three years.\n\nSo, my reasoning leads me to assign each factor as either low or medium. The overall prediction is that it's not likely he'll reoffend, but with some uncertainty because he's young and in an urban environment which might have different dynamics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Upbringing\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old and was living with four family members in an urban area.

However, it does not directly correlate with high risk without additional mitigating factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone and never married may suggest a lack of support network, which could potentially increase risk if underlying issues such as substance abuse or mental health problems exist. However, this factor does not directly correlate with high risk without additional information about potential stressors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive indicator of good mental health and reduced risk of engaging in self-harm or criminal behavior related to mental health issues.
