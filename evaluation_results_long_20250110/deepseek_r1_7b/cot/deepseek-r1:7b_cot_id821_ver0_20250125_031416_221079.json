    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking for a risk assessment on an 18-year-old male with several factors listed. They want each factor evaluated as low, medium, or high risk, then predict rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nHis race is White. I know that racial disparities in the criminal justice system exist, but at 18, he's still considered a minor, so maybe not significant here.\n\nHe has a single arrest and one conviction. That might indicate past behavior, but since it's his first offense, perhaps low risk?\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism prediction unless there's some health concern mentioned. He hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, so that should be low.\n\nLiving alone without a partner\u2014maybe not directly related, but living on his own might show independence, which could be positive or neutral.\n\nHe has one job, which suggests employability and responsibility, another positive sign.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years shows he's been clean, good for him.\n\nYoung age when he lived with both parents in a household of four\u2014could indicate early experiences that might have shaped his behavior. But since he's an adult now, maybe less impact.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which could be related to delinquent behavior or self-perception but not sure how directly linked.\n\nNow, putting it all together: All factors seem positive except maybe the past residence with four people. However, considering his age and clean living situation, I think he's low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"The individual is White, which may indicate racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but at 18 years old, this factor might not significantly impact recidivism\u9884\u6d4b at this stage.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"low\", \"He has one arrest and one conviction.
