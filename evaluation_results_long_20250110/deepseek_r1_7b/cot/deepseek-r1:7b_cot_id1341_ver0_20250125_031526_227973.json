    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a history of 5 arrests and convictions. That's quite significant. Recidivism is often higher with multiple past convictions because each offense increases the chances of getting caught again. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nShe's Hispanic, but I don't think ethnicity plays a direct role here unless there are systemic issues, which aren't indicated. So maybe medium risk from that.\n\nHer age is 21, which isn't too old yet, so she's still developing her skills and life choices. That might temper the risk a bit, making it perhaps medium rather than high.\n\nShe weighs 218 lbs at 5'2\", which is quite heavy but not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior directly. Maybe low impact on recidivism unless there are other factors related to health or substance use.\n\nMarried and living alone... Being married doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, but living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might be a risk factor if she's lonely or facing stress. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college \u2013 some education is better than none, but it doesn't predict future behavior directly. Maybe low risk unless she's been doing something else.\n\nShe held 2 jobs last year, which suggests good financial stability if she's working well. So perhaps low to medium.\n\nNo drug use for four years \u2013 that's a strong positive indicator of stability and self-control, so low risk from this factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month \u2013 another positive sign, indicating mental health is okay, so low impact on recidivism.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or stressors, which might be a minor contributing factor but probably medium risk unless there's more info about living conditions.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with her life \u2013 this could indicate a lack of religious support, which some studies suggest might correlate with lower self-control and higher recidivism. So maybe high risk here because it could affect her motivation or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple past convictions (high), urban living (medium), lack of religious belief (high). The other factors like job stability are positive but don't outweigh the negatives from the high factors. So overall, I think there's a higher chance she'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Past convictions significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Urban Area Exposure\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area may expose her to higher crime rates or stressors, though no direct evidence is provided about living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Believing God has nothing to do with her life could indicate a potential lack of religious support, which might affect self-control and motivation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
