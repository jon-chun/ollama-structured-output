    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 22-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has two arrests but no convictions. That's a mitigating factor because she hasn't been convicted yet, so maybe her risk is lower compared to someone with a conviction.\n\nShe's White, which might be considered neutral in some contexts, but without specific info on racial disparities, I'll default to neutral factors unless there are other clues.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here. She's not married and isn't living alone, so she has support around her, which is a good sign for reoffering.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nOnly one job during the year\u2014maybe some instability if she relies heavily on that job, but since she's not in college, maybe she's self-sufficient enough.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. Positive indicators here, suggesting good mental health and substance abuse issues are under control.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of six. That's a supportive environment, which is usually positive for recidivism rates.\n\nShe believes in God, which can be seen as a positive factor promoting personal accountability.\n\nConsidering all these factors: two arrests (mitigating), no convictions, education level, support around her, job history, no drug use, and supportive family. These all point towards low risk of rearrest. Therefore, my prediction is \"NO\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested twice but not convicted, which is a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"neutral\", \"White is considered neutral without specific racial disparities information.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"irrelevant\", \"Her height (5'6\") and weight (190 lbs) do not directly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"She is unmarried and currently not living alone, providing support network.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, indicating some educational background.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year; this could be stable if not relying heavily on it.\"),\n    (\"Drug use and mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and no depression over the past month suggest good mental health.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"neutral\", \"Living with both parents at a young age in a household of six indicates supportive surroundings.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"positive\", \"Her belief in God can promote personal accountability and positive behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
