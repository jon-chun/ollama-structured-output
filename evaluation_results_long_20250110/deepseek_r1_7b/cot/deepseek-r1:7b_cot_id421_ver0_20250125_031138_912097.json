    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with three arrests and two convictions. That seems significant because prior convictions are usually strong indicators of recidivism. Each arrest can contribute to more stress and strain in his life, making him more prone to relapse.\n\nHis age is 22, which might mean he's still relatively young, but having multiple arrests by that age could indicate underlying issues or perhaps substance use problems that haven't been addressed.\n\nHe identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk factor, but it's worth noting in case there are any systemic factors at play. However, since he's not of color, maybe we can focus more on his personal circumstances.\n\nStanding at 6'0\" and weighing 170 lbs might be relevant if he's been struggling with weight management or if there's an associated health issue that could impact his ability to reintegrate into society safely. But without more info on this, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nHe's never married and living alone suggests he doesn't have a support network, which is usually a bad sign in terms of reintegration. Lack of support can lead to isolation and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college might mean he has some educational background but isn't continuing his education or training that could help prevent future issues. Maybe he's relying on past experiences rather than seeking new opportunities.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year, which is positive because employment can provide stability and reduce unemployment-driven stressors. However, if those jobs were in low-paying sectors or if there are underlying issues like substance use, it might not be as beneficial.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but had a bad mental health month where he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests possible untreated mental health issues, which can significantly impact recidivism rates when left untreated.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with both biological parents and living in an urban area might have its pros and cons. Urban areas often offer more opportunities but can also be isolating or contribute to higher stress levels. Being in a large family could mean he didn't get enough individualized attention, which might explain his current mental health struggles.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life is interesting. It could indicate a lack of religious support and possibly other spiritual or emotional support systems missing, which are important for maintaining sobriety and overall well-being.\n\nPutting all this together: His multiple arrests, lack of support network (living alone), possible untreated mental health, and limited educational/career plans seem to stack up as significant risk factors. The high school diploma without college enrollment could mean he's not seeking further help or opportunities that might prevent future issues.\n\nWhile his recent job experience is positive, the other factors weigh more heavily towards a higher risk of reoffending within three years. Therefore, I'd assign a high relative weight to each of these factors and predict a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"His multiple arrests (3) and convictions (2) indicate a history of criminal behavior that can contribute significantly to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may increase stress and substance use, both of which are risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"medium\", \"He felt extremely down during a recent month, suggesting possible untreated mental health issues that could impact his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Support Network Missing\", \"high\", \"Living with four parents in an urban area and not being married may indicate a lack of support network, which is crucial for avoiding relapse.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college or working full-time could limit opportunities and contribute to higher stress levels.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"high\", \"Living with four parents might have affected his individualized attention needs, potentially contributing to mental health challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
