    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is one factor. Since he's young and has only one arrest without a conviction, maybe that's low risk? But it's still an arrest, so perhaps medium.\n\nHe weighs 170 lbs at 5'10\", which is average for his age group. No family issues since he's living alone with his mom when she was young\u2014so maybe medium because he has support but no problems there?\n\nHigh school diploma and not college\u2014so he has some education, which might mean better job opportunities, so low risk.\n\nHe worked two jobs, which is positive; stable income could help him stay out of trouble. Low risk here too.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana, which can have negative consequences if it's causing issues. But since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe it's not a major problem now. Medium risk because of past drug use but no current mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his mom at a young age in an urban area\u2014so he might be exposed to higher stress or crime rates. Maybe medium risk due to living conditions and family background.\n\nConsidering all these factors, each point isn't pushing him towards high risk, so the overall prediction would probably be low.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several factors that contribute to his risk of rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: One prior arrest without a conviction is present but not severe enough to immediately indicate high risk.\n\n2. **Demographics and Family Background**: Living with his biological mother in a household of seven, especially at a young age, suggests potential exposure to family dynamics or social stressors, contributing medium risk.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: With a high school diploma and two job experiences, this indicates stable economic status, reducing risk factors.\n\n4. **Drug Use and Mental Health**: Past marijuana use without recent mental health issues could have negative effects if current behavior is problematic, but he hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nConsidering these points collectively, the risk appears to be low as there are no significant contributors to high recidivism risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without a conviction suggests some risk but not necessarily high risk on its own\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of seven adds medium risk due to potential exposure to family dynamics or social stressors\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and employment history indicate stable economic status, reducing risk factors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years could have negative consequences if current behavior is problematic but no recent mental health issues suggest low immediate risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
