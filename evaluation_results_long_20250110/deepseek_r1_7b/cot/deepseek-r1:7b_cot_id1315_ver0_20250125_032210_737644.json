    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. Let's break down all his factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two convictions. That's a solid red flag because past convictions are a big indicator of future behavior. Each conviction carries some risk, so that alone should be considered high.\n\nHis age is 20, which is still relatively young. Young adults often have more impulsive decisions, but it also depends on his current situation and support system. He's living alone, which can be risky without proper supervision or resources. That might add to the medium risk here.\n\nHe has a GED instead of a degree, so maybe he's looking for better opportunities. But sometimes, people with a GED still struggle to find steady employment, leading to dependency issues. That would point towards medium risk because while he's motivated, other factors could affect his stability.\n\nNot being enrolled in college might mean he's not seeking further education or training, which is crucial for avoiding recidivism if he gets back into trouble. So this should be considered medium as well.\n\nHe only held one job during the past year. Employment is a key factor\u2014people with stable jobs tend to have lower recidivism rates. With just one job and no history of unemployment or underemployment, maybe it's not too bad, but still something to consider as medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed for a month. These positive factors suggest he's been making efforts for betterment, which is good news. It lowers the risk because substance abuse and mental health issues are major contributors to recidivism.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of three in a rural area. That environment might have had its own challenges, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there were specific stressors or influences. Since he doesn't mention any issues related to that time, maybe this factor is low.\n\nBelieving in God could be a positive motivator, as spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates. It's a strong internalizing factor, so it should be considered high risk-reducing but not directly contributing to risk unless there are underlying issues he hasn't mentioned.\n\nPutting all these together: two convictions (high), living alone and being 20 (medium), GED and not in college (medium), one job (medium). The positive factors like no drug use and depression (low) might temper some of the high-risk elements. However, the lack of a strong support system or supervision could increase risk.\n\nSo overall, considering all these points, his risk is likely medium with low confidence because while there are mitigating factors, he still has significant risk from his past convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"two_prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Past criminal history of two convictions significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_20_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Age 20 is associated with higher risk due to impulsive decisions, but living alone can be mitigated by support systems.\"),\n    (\"ged_status\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED without college enrollment may indicate limited opportunities for betterment and increased dependency risks.\"),\n    (\"only_one_job Past Year\", \"medium\", \"Employment history is positive, but only one job over the past year could signal instability or underemployment which might lead to reintegration issues.\"),\n    (\"no drug_use_and_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent substance abuse or depression suggests a proactive approach towards avoiding recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological father in a rural household of three does not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless specific stressors are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
