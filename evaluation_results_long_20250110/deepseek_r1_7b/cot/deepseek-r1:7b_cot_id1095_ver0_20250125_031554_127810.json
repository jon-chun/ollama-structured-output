    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Hispanic male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a high recidivism indicator because reoffending is common after prior convictions.\n\nHe's separated and living alone. Living in a stable environment might help reduce risk compared to living with others who could potentially influence him negatively.\n\nHis education level: he has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe not much opportunity for upward mobility, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nNot working during the year is concerning because income instability often leads to other criminal activities or increased drug use.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the last month. These are positive signs that might indicate he's been trying to change his life, which could lower future risk.\n\nHis background: he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area at a young age. That's a crowded home environment, possibly leading to higher stress or neglect, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nNot believing in God might indicate a lack of religious support for his decisions, but that's a personal choice and less directly tied to criminal behavior unless he's influenced by religion.\n\nPutting it all together: The high number of prior arrests (four) is a strong indicator. His living situation alone doesn't negate that much. His education gap could mean limited opportunities, which can lead to further issues. Not working raises concerns about financial instability and possible drug or alcohol issues. Despite the positive factors like no recent drug use and depression, the prior convictions and living conditions are more significant.\n\nSo, I think there's a high risk of rearrest. The confidence is pretty high because three out of four factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"High due to multiple prior arrests and convictions which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide some stability but does not negate past criminal history and current circumstances.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests limited opportunities for positive change which can contribute to recidivism but is not definitive.\"),\n    (\"worklessness\", \"high\", \"Not working during the year increases the risk of involvement in criminal activities or substance abuse commonly linked to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use indicates a possible effort towards self-improvement which mitigates risk but does not override other factors.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests positive mental health which can reduce recidivism risk despite other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"high\", \"Living with both parents in a large household urban area may have contributed to stress or neglect increasing the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Not believing in God is neutral and does not directly correlate with criminal behavior but is unrelated to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
