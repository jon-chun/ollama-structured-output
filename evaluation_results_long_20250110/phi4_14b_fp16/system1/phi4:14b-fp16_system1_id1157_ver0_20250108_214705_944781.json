Her upbringing in an urban area with a household size of 5 could suggest exposure to challenging environments.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Holding only one job during the year might reflect instability or challenges in maintaining employment, which can contribute to risk factors.\n\nWhile these indicators collectively suggest a moderate-to-high risk level, individual circumstances and additional context would be necessary for a more precise assessment. The confidence score reflects this consideration of various contributing factors without definitive evidence pointing to high risk.",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
