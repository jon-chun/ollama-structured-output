This factor alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Employment and Education**: Holding two jobs within a year suggests a level of responsibility and stability. Having a high school diploma is also a positive indicator, although not being enrolled in college limits further educational opportunities.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning but does not automatically indicate ongoing risk without current usage patterns or frequency details.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: The individual has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting no immediate mental health concerns that might contribute to high-risk behavior.\n\n6. **Family and Living Situation**: Growing up in a two-parent household in an urban area is neutral but stable. Currently living alone does not inherently indicate risk without additional context (e.g., support systems).\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: Considering God's role in personal matters can be associated with lower recidivism rates, as it may provide moral guidance.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, they do not collectively suggest a high risk of future criminal behavior or instability. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the limited data on current behaviors and potential changes over time.",
