Being female also statistically indicates a lower risk of re-offending.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: With only one arrest and conviction, her criminal history is relatively limited, suggesting a lower risk profile.\n\n3. **Socioeconomic Factors**: She has completed high school and held a job within the past year. While not enrolled in college might indicate limited upward mobility, having employment is a positive factor.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but without current usage or other substance abuse issues, this may not significantly elevate her risk.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: She has not experienced depression recently, indicating stable mental health, which reduces the likelihood of recidivism associated with untreated mental illness.\n\n6. **Social and Family Background**: Growing up in a stable household with both parents and living alone currently provides mixed insights\u2014while family stability is positive, current solitary living could be concerning if it indicates social isolation.\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God has influence over her life can contribute to personal accountability and lower risk of re-offending for some individuals.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., past drug use, limited job history), they do not collectively indicate a high level of risk. The confidence score reflects the moderate certainty in this assessment given the available data.",
