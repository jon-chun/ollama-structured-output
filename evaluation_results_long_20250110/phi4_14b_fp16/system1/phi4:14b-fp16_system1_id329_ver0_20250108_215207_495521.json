This alone doesn't indicate high risk without further context.\n\n3. **Demographics**:\n   - Race and ethnicity (White) do not inherently indicate higher risk.\n   - Physical attributes like height and weight are irrelevant to risk assessment.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married is common for her age, but it can sometimes correlate with stability issues. However, this alone is not a strong predictor of high risk.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Not living alone might suggest some level of support or supervision, which could be positive in terms of risk mitigation.\n\n6. **Education and Employment**:\n   - Having a GED is a positive factor.\n   - Holding two jobs indicates employment stability, which is generally a protective factor against recidivism.\n\n7. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana is noted, but without current use or issues related to substance abuse, it doesn't significantly elevate risk.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: No recent depression suggests stable mental health, reducing the likelihood of high risk.\n\n9. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household with both parents can be protective. The urban upbringing is neutral without additional context on neighborhood crime rates or family dynamics.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: A belief that God influences personal outcomes might suggest some level of hope and purpose, potentially reducing risk.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, while there are some factors like past arrests and convictions, the presence of protective factors such as employment stability, education, supportive living situation, and absence of current substance abuse or mental health issues suggests a lower risk. The confidence is moderate (75) due to limited data on the severity of past offenses and lack of recent negative behaviors.",
