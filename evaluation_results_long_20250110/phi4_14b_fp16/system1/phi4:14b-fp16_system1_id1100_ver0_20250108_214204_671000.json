Repeat offenses are a strong indicator of higher risk for future offending.\n\n4. **Employment Stability**: Having held only two jobs in the past year suggests potential instability in employment, which can correlate with economic stressors that might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Education Level**: The lack of a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and resources, potentially increasing risk factors associated with recidivism.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) within the last four years is relevant as substance abuse can be linked to criminal activity and mental health issues.\n\n7. **Mental Health Indicators**: Expressing feelings of hopelessness (\"so down in the dumps\") suggests potential mental health challenges, which are significant risk factors for recidivism if not addressed.\n\n8. **Family Background and Beliefs**: Growing up in an urban area with adoptive parents and having a belief system that is detached from religion could influence social support networks and coping mechanisms.\n\nThese combined factors indicate multiple areas of concern that contribute to assessing the individual as high-risk, although confidence is not absolute due to inherent uncertainties in predictive modeling. The confidence level reflects the weight of these risk indicators while acknowledging limitations in prediction accuracy.",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his adoptive parent(s) in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
