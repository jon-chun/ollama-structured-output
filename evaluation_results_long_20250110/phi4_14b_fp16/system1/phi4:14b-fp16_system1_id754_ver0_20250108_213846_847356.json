However, his age (21) also suggests he may still be developing in terms of decision-making skills.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: He has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction does not strongly indicate high risk, as it lacks legal confirmation of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes and Living Situation**: His height and weight are notable but do not directly correlate with risk factors for recidivism or future offenses. Living alone might suggest independence but also a lack of support network, which can be a moderate concern.\n\n4. **Employment and Education**: Not being employed and having no college enrollment could indicate instability, which is a potential risk factor. However, his holding no jobs during the year without further context (e.g., recent graduation) doesn't strongly suggest high risk on its own.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but it's not specified as ongoing or problematic. Lack of depression and stable mental health in the past month are positive indicators.\n\n6. **Family and Social Environment**: Growing up in a relatively large household in an urban area can have varied implications. The presence of both biological parents might suggest some stability during his formative years, which is generally protective against risk behaviors.\n\n7. **Religious or Spiritual Beliefs**: His belief that God has something to do with personal events could indicate a sense of external locus of control, but it doesn't directly correlate with high-risk behavior without additional negative indicators.\n\n**Conclusion**: While there are some factors (e.g., unemployment, single arrest) that might raise concerns, they do not collectively indicate a high risk. The confidence is moderate due to the lack of strong positive risk indicators and the presence of some protective factors.",
