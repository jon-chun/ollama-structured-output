This suggests potential ongoing involvement with the legal system.\n\n- **Unstable Employment History:** Holding multiple jobs within a year may suggest instability or difficulty maintaining steady employment, which is often considered a risk factor.\n\n- **Drug Use:** Past drug use (marijuana) can be indicative of substance-related issues, though it's less severe than harder drugs. However, any history of drug use is relevant to risk assessment.\n\n- **Lack of Marital Status and Living Alone:** Being unmarried and living alone might suggest a lack of social support networks, which are important for stability and reducing recidivism risks.\n\n- **Religious Belief:** While personal beliefs can be protective factors, they do not directly mitigate the identified risk factors in this context.\n\nGiven these considerations, the combination of factors suggests a moderate to high risk, leading to a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75. This reflects the presence of several notable risk indicators balanced against some mitigating aspects like educational attainment and no recent depression.",
