However, being enrolled in school shows some positive engagement, which might mitigate risks slightly.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant factor as it can be associated with increased risk for future criminal behavior or relapse into substance abuse.\n\n5. **Living Situation and Marital Status**: Living alone and never having been married could indicate potential social isolation, which might elevate risk factors.\n\n6. **Religious Beliefs**: A lack of religious belief (\"God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\") can sometimes correlate with higher risk in certain studies, though this is a less direct indicator.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests no immediate mental health crisis, which might reduce risk slightly.\n\n8. **Background Environment**: Growing up in an urban area and having lived in group quarters could have exposed him to environments that statistically correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nOverall, while some factors like education enrollment are positive, the combination of criminal history, drug use, and personal background suggest a moderate to high-risk level. The confidence is set at 75 due to these mixed indicators.",
