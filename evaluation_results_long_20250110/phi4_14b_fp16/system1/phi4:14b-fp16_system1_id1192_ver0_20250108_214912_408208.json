However, without conviction and considering other factors, this alone does not indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** She has been arrested once but was not convicted. A lack of convictions suggests a lower likelihood of recidivism compared to those with prior convictions.\n\n4. **Family and Social Structure:** Being married and living with her spouse can be protective factors against reoffending, as stable relationships often provide support systems that discourage criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Education:** Having a GED is better than having no high school diploma or equivalent, but it indicates some challenges in educational attainment. However, she does not have negative indicators such as current drug use or employment issues.\n\n6. **Employment Status:** Not holding a job for the past year could be a concern, as unemployment can increase risk factors. However, this is somewhat mitigated by her stable personal life and lack of other risk behaviors.\n\n7. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators. Substance abuse and mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\n8. **Upbringing and Beliefs:** Growing up in an urban area with her biological mother and having a belief system involving God could provide social support and personal resilience, which are protective factors.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk elements (e.g., age, lack of employment), the absence of convictions, stable relationship, no recent substance use or mental health issues, and positive beliefs suggest she is not at high risk. The confidence level reflects this assessment with consideration for potential uncertainties in predicting future behavior.",
