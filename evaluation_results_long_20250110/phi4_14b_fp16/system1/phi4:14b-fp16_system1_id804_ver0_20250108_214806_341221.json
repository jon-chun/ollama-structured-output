Holding only two jobs in the past year suggests instability in employment.\n\n4. **Education Level**: Having a GED instead of a higher education degree can correlate with higher risk factors, though this is not deterministic on its own.\n\n5. **Age**: At 22 years old, she is at an age where individuals are often still developing coping mechanisms and life skills, which might increase vulnerability to risk-taking behaviors if other support systems are lacking.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the combination of these factors but acknowledges that individual circumstances can vary widely, and not all predictive models will capture every nuance.",
