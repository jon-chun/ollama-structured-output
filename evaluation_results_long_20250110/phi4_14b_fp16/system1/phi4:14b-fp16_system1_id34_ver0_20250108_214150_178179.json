    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age and Gender:** At 18 years old, males are generally considered higher risk due to impulsivity associated with youth. However, age alone is not a definitive high-risk indicator.\n\n2. **Ethnicity:** There is no specific evidence suggesting that identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander directly correlates with higher criminal justice risk in this context.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** Two prior arrests and convictions suggest some past involvement with the legal system but do not necessarily indicate high future risk, especially without more serious offenses or recent activity.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics:** Height and weight are less indicative of risk unless related to specific behavioral patterns.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being unmarried and living alone might suggest a lack of immediate social support, which could be a moderate risk factor. However, this is not strongly predictive on its own.\n\n6. **Education and Employment:** Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are positive indicators. Holding one job indicates some stability but suggests room for improvement.\n\n7. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression symptoms are positive indicators, suggesting lower risk related to substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\n8. **Family Background:** Growing up in a larger household can suggest varying levels of support or stress but is not directly predictive without more context.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs:** Belief that God has something to do with personal events may provide psychological resilience, which could be protective against risk behaviors.\n\nOverall, while there are some moderate risk factors present (such as previous convictions and living alone), the positive indicators in education, substance use, mental health, and current engagement in college suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to potential unknowns or unmeasured variables that could influence risk assessment.",
