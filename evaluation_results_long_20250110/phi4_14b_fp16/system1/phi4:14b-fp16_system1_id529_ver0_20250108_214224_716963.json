However, without more details on the nature of these offenses or recency, it's moderate rather than high risk.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: Lack of a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college are negative indicators for future stability but holding two jobs during the year shows some level of employment engagement.\n\n4. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use in the past four years and absence of recent depression are positive signs, reducing risk related to substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\n5. **Social and Personal Factors**: Living alone and never married could imply limited social support, which is a risk factor. However, his belief in God suggests some personal coping mechanism.\n\n6. **Household Size During Childhood**: Growing up in a household of size 5 might indicate socio-economic challenges but doesn't directly correlate with high recidivism without additional context.\n\nOverall, while there are several moderate risk factors, the lack of recent criminal behavior or substance abuse and his current employment status suggest a lower risk level. The confidence is moderate due to limited data on the nature of past offenses and social support systems.",
