A single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: Enrollment in college and having held a job indicate positive social integration and stability, which are protective factors against high-risk behavior.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but without current usage or escalation into more harmful substances, it does not significantly elevate risk.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: The absence of recent depression suggests stable mental health, reducing the risk factor associated with mental health issues.\n\n6. **Family and Social Background**: Growing up in a rural area with both biological parents can be seen as a protective factor due to potential family support.\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes may provide a sense of purpose or moral guidance, which can be protective.\n\nOverall, the combination of educational engagement, employment, stable mental health, and lack of recent substance use suggests a lower risk profile. The confidence level is moderate (75) due to the limited data on other potential risk factors such as peer influences, criminal associations, or detailed behavioral history.",
