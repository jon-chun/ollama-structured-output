The individual has been arrested once without conviction, suggesting higher risk.\n\n4. **Education Level**: Lack of education is a significant factor; many who reoffend lack a diploma or GED.\n\n5. **Employment History**: Holding 2 jobs shows some stability but not enough to outweigh other risks, thus medium weight.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Marijuana use is prevalent among those with recidivism outcomes, indicating medium risk.\n\n7. **Mental Health Status**: No recent depression reduces the likelihood of mental health contributing to reoffending, so low risk.\n\n8. **Early Life Household Size**: This factor appears less significant in determining outcomes, thus assigned low weight.\n\n9. **Early Life Residence Type**: Growing up with biological parents is not strongly correlated with recidivism, given medium weight due to urban environment context.\n\n10. **Religious Belief Influence**: Does not seem to significantly impact the likelihood of reoffending; therefore, it's considered low risk.\n\n**Overall Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nThe prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, based on a combination of factors where education level and arrest history are high risks but mitigated by employment stability and absence of recent mental health issues. The confidence level is set at 70 due to the mixed significance of various factors and their interactions in predicting outcomes.",
