His physical attributes and living situation are also not indicative of high risk factors. While past substance use is noted, it has been for marijuana only, which is less severe compared to other substances. His religious beliefs, while unique, do not inherently pose a higher risk. The absence of employment history and the fact that he currently lives alone could be seen as vulnerability factors but are not in themselves indicative of high-risk behavior. Overall, the combination of these factors points towards a low risk assessment.",
