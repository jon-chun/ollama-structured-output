Her limited education and employment history are also less concerning without further context indicating a pattern of disengagement from societal norms or opportunities. The occasional feelings of depression without any evidence of mental health issues or self-harm behaviors, coupled with her religious beliefs, do not indicate high risk either. However, the lack of stable housing and family support in a household of 9 may signal vulnerability, but this alone is not sufficient to predict a high risk profile given the other factors mentioned.",
