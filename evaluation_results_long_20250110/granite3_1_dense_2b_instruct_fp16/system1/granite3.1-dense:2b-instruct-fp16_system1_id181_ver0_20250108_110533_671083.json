Her age, gender, ethnicity, living situation (alone), and religious beliefs do not suggest an inherently high risk profile. The fact that she has never been married and holds no current employment does not necessarily imply future criminal behavior. However, her history of substance use and past mental health struggles (feeling consistently down) should be considered. Overall, the information provided does not strongly suggest a high-risk individual, with a confidence level of 90%.",
