Age (20 years old): While young, this does not automatically indicate high risk; many individuals in this age group are low-risk.\n2. Gender and Ethnicity (White Male): Neither of these factors directly correlate with high risk.\n3. Criminal History: Having been arrested once without conviction suggests a relatively minor offense, not indicating high risk.\n4. Physical Health: The individual's height and weight are average for his age. He has no reported health issues that would suggest high risk.\n5. Employment: Holding one job is not indicative of high risk; it could imply stability or difficulty finding employment.\n6. Substance Use (Marijuana and Cocaine): Past use does not necessarily predict future high-risk behavior, especially if the individual has not used in recent months.\n7. Mental Health: The individual reports no depression over the past month, which is a positive indicator of low risk.\n8. Family Background (Living with both biological parents in a large household): This suggests a stable upbringing, reducing the potential for high-risk development.\n9. Religious Beliefs: The individual's belief that God influences life events can be seen as a positive factor, associating with lower risk.\n\nOverall, these factors indicate a relatively low-risk profile.",
