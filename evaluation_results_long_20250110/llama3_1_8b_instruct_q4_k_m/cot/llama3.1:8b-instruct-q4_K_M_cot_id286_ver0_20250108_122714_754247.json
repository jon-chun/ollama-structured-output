He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
