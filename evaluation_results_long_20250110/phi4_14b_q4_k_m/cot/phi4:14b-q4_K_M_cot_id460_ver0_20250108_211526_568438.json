He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 204 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area.
