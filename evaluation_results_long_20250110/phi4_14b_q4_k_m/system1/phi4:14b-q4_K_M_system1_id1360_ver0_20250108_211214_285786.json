However, repeated interactions with law enforcement can still be seen as a risk factor.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Lack of high school diploma/GED and no current employment are significant socioeconomic factors that correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\n5. **Drug Use:** Past drug use (marijuana) is relevant to assessing risk, especially if it suggests a pattern or potential for continued substance abuse.\n\n6. **Social Support and Mental Health:** Living alone without marriage may indicate limited social support, which can be a risk factor. However, absence of recent depression symptoms is a positive indicator.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs:** While not directly related to criminal behavior, strong religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if they provide moral guidance or community support.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for high risk, but with moderate confidence (75) due to the mixed nature of some indicators and lack of recent negative mental health signs.",
