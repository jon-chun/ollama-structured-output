A belief that God influences personal events can be neutral or even protective depending on context.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could suggest moderate risk (e.g., age, single arrest), the lack of convictions and current stability in employment and mental health lean towards a lower risk prediction with moderate confidence.",
