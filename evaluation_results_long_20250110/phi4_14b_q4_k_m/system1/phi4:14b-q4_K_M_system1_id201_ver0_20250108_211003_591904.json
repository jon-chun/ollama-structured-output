A lack of convictions typically indicates a lower risk level.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: While she lacks formal education (no high school diploma or GED), she has held three jobs over the past year, suggesting some stability in employment.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: No drug use reported in the past four years is a positive factor.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: Experiencing depressive symptoms occasionally can be concerning but does not alone indicate high risk without additional factors like substance abuse or violent behavior.\n\n6. **Social and Cultural Factors**: Identifying as Hispanic, living with others, and having religious beliefs may provide social support structures that mitigate risk.\n\n7. **Household Size**: Growing up in a household of size 4 is neutral; it neither significantly increases nor decreases risk without additional context.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment leans towards lower risk, though some concerns like mental health symptoms warrant monitoring. The confidence level reflects this balance and acknowledges potential uncertainties in individual behavior prediction.",
