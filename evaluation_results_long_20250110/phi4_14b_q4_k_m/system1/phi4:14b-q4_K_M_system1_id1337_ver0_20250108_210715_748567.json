    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe analysis incorporates several key risk factors which collectively suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism or further criminal behavior:\n\n1. **Age and Gender:** Being a young adult (20 years old) can be associated with impulsivity and vulnerability to negative influences, though gender-specific statistics show females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** A previous arrest and conviction indicate prior involvement in the criminal justice system, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n3. **Educational Attainment:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities and increase financial strain, potentially contributing to re-offense.\n\n4. **Employment Stability:** Having held only one job during the year suggests potential instability in employment, which can be a stressor and risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is associated with increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. Recent feelings of depression might exacerbate substance abuse issues.\n\n6. **Mental Health:** Expressing significant depressive symptoms (\"down in the dumps\") can influence decision-making and increase risk behaviors, including criminal activity.\n\n7. **Social and Religious Beliefs:** Lack of a perceived connection with God or religious community may mean fewer protective social supports that often discourage recidivism.\n\n8. **Living Situation:** Living alone might indicate limited social support networks which are crucial in providing stability and preventing re-offense.\n\nWhile these factors suggest an elevated risk, the confidence level is set at 75 due to the complexity of human behavior and the potential for positive change with appropriate interventions.",
