The factors pointing towards high risk include: \n\n* **Age:** Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates, especially when combined with other risk factors\n* **Criminal History:**  9 arrests and convictions are strong indicators of prior criminal behavior.\n* **Socioeconomic Factors:** Lack of education, employment, and living alone may indicate limited social support and potential for vulnerability to peer pressure or substance abuse. \n* **Racial Identity:** Being Black in a society with systemic biases can increase the likelihood of encountering discrimination and unequal treatment by law enforcement.  \n\n**Important Notes:**  Risk assessment should not be solely reliant on a single set of factors but rather used as part of a comprehensive evaluation, considering individual circumstances and contextual information. \n",
