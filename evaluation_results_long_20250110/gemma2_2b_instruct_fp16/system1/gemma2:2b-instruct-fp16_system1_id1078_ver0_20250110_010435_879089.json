This history suggests potential for future offenses and disregard for legal consequences.\n* **Socioeconomic Factors**:  Lack of education, employment, and limited social support networks can contribute to recidivism. \n* **Substance Use**: Marijuana use, even if not currently active, could indicate underlying problems or a predisposition towards substance abuse. \n* **Social Environment**: Living alone in an urban area, particularly with a history of living with his mother in a household of size 3, might point to social factors that increase the likelihood of involvement with criminal activity.\n\n\nIt's important to note:\n\n* This is a preliminary assessment based on limited information. A comprehensive risk assessment requires additional data and context-specific considerations.\n* The absence of depression does not negate the need for further investigation.  \n* Statistical models may be used, but they must be calibrated with careful consideration of social determinants of crime in order to produce accurate predictions. \n\n\n",
