However, it is not a strong indicator in isolation. \n* **Substance Use:** High - Drug use is a significant concern as it can exacerbate existing problems and lead to further criminal activity. \n* **Social Support:** Low - Living alone without strong social ties indicates limited access to support systems which increases risk for relapse.  \n* **Family Structure:** Medium - The household structure may offer stability, but its impact on recidivism is less clear. \n* **Religious Beliefs:** Medium - Religion can provide a moral framework and community support. However, it doesn't inherently predict recidivism.\n\n**Confidence Level:** A moderate confidence level (75%) reflects the complex nature of risk assessment.  Multiple factors must be considered and assessed based on individual circumstances. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is illustrative and does not constitute a definitive prediction of future behavior. Each case should be evaluated individually considering all available information and professional judgment. \n",
