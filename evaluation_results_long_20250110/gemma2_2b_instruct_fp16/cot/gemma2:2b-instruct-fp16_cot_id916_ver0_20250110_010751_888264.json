A high weight is given to age, prior arrest, and substance use due to their well-established link with future criminal behavior. Education level suggests a lower risk.  It's important to note this is a simplified analysis. Actual risk assessment requires much more sophisticated data integration and consideration of individual circumstances. \n",
