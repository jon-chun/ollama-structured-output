While this isn't an indicator of recidivism in itself, it warrants further evaluation and support.\n* **Living Situation (Low):** Living alone could be viewed as a positive factor.\n* **Social Support (Low):**  A lack of strong social connections can increase vulnerability to reoffending. \n\n**Confidence Level:** The overall prediction leans towards \"NO\" due to the presence of factors that traditionally indicate lower recidivism, particularly education and relatively stable employment. However, the high factor for substance use warrants careful monitoring and intervention.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This is a highly simplified risk assessment using limited information. Real-world risk assessments are much more complex and would involve considering multiple factors and individual circumstances. \n* Mental health, substance abuse, and other social determinants of behavior should be considered critical components in any serious risk assessment.\n* It's crucial to remember that risk assessment is just a tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities; it doesn't determine an individual's fate.  \n\n\n",
