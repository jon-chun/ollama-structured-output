Here's why:\n\n* **Age, Education, and Employment**: These factors tend to be associated with lower recidivism rates in young adults. A high school diploma, part-time employment, and relatively recent drug use are all indicators that this individual is not at peak risk.\n* **Race:** While racial bias exists within the criminal justice system, the impact of race on recidivism in this case seems to be a neutral factor based on the provided information. \n* **Prior Arrest (unconvicted):** A single arrest without conviction could suggest the individual is not at high risk for future involvement with law enforcement.\n\n\nIt's crucial to remember that these factors, though statistically relevant, do not completely determine an individual's risk. Recidivism is influenced by complex social and psychological factors beyond what we can assess here. \n",
