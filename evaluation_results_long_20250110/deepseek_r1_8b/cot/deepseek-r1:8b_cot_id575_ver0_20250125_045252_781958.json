    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. I know that age can be a factor\u2014yOUNGER individuals typically have higher recidivism rates compared to older adults. So maybe this is a medium risk there.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest history alone isn't conclusive, but since it's just an arrest without a conviction, it might not weigh as heavily as if he had a prior conviction. Maybe that's a low factor.\n\nHis physical description\u20145'9\" and 143 lbs\u2014is pretty average. I don't know how much height and weight influence recidivism, but maybe it doesn't contribute much. Probably a low factor here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is not living alone. Living situation can impact risk. If he's living with others, there might be more supervision or support, which could lower the risk. So that might be a low factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can influence recidivism\u2014higher education often correlates with lower rates. Since he's enrolled, maybe this is a positive indicator, so perhaps a medium to low factor here.\n\nHe has held four jobs in the past year. Employment can be a strong protective factor. Stable employment usually reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior because it provides structure and financial stability. So that might be a high factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor, but since he's been clean for four years, that's a positive sign. His mental health doesn't seem to be an issue right now, so maybe that's another protective factor. So those could both be low factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family might provide more support and supervision, which can lower recidivism. Plus, being in an urban area isn't inherently risky, so maybe that's a medium factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could mean he has a strong sense of purpose or faith, which might be a protective factor. So that might be low.\n\nPutting it all together: higher education and employment are strong positives, but he's young and has a prior arrest without a conviction. His living situation is positive, and he's clean from drugs now. Maybe his belief in God adds another layer of protection. So overall, I think the risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"only one arrest without a conviction\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"average height and weight, no significant impact\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"low\", \"not living alone, possibly with support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma and enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"held four jobs, strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"clean for four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no depression reported\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"lived with family in urban area\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"faith may provide support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
