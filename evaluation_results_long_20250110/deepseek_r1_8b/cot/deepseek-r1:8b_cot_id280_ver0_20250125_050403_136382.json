    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic details: he's Black, 5'7\", weighs 170 lbs. He's never married and lives alone now. Not having a high school diploma or GED might be a red flag because education is often linked to lower recidivism. But he's held one job recently, which could mean some stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but he reported feeling depressed last month. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism. His upbringing was in an urban area with both biological parents\u2014could that have influenced his environment or access to resources? He also mentions believing in God's influence on his life, which might affect his decision-making or mindset.\n\nArrest history is a big factor. Six arrests without convictions suggests he's been involved in the criminal justice system but hasn't been locked up yet. This could mean he's more likely to continue behavior if not intervened.\n\nLooking at the prediction models I'm familiar with, factors like age, criminal history, education, and substance use are typically weighted medium. His lack of education is a high risk because it's associated with higher recidivism rates. Substance use abstention is low because it's positive. His mental health could be another factor\u2014depression might be medium. His employment, though only one job, is a positive sign, so that would be low.\n\nPutting this all together: education (high), criminal history (medium), substance use (low), employment (low), age (young, medium), depression (medium), belief system (could be either, but maybe low since it's not directly tied to recidivism). So the prediction leans towards yes with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested six times without conviction, indicating a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk factors related to substance-related crimes\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Recent employment suggests possible behavioral stabilization\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk due to higher impulsivity and limited life experience\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Reported depression could increase risk of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents may not significantly impact recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is not directly tied to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
