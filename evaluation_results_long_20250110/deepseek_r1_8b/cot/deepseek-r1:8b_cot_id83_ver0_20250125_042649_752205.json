    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her background.\n\nFirst, she identifies as Black. I know that race can be a factor in the criminal justice system, often leading to disparities, so that's probably a medium factor.\n\nShe has an arrest history without any convictions. That might lower the risk compared to someone with a conviction, so maybe that's a low factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 140 lbs. Not sure how much physical size affects risk, but I think it can sometimes be a factor in sentencing or target selection, so medium.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has more access to opportunities for crime, or maybe less supervision. Could be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower criminality, but she hasn't had any jobs either. Maybe that's a high risk factor because education and employment are protective factors.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but was feeling down a lot recently. Depression can be both a risk factor for committing crimes and a protective factor if it leads to self-incarceration or seeking help. But feeling down might increase the likelihood, so maybe medium.\n\nShe lived with foster parents in an urban area as a child. Urban environments are often high-crime areas, and foster care can sometimes expose kids to more risks. That's probably high.\n\nHer lack of belief in God could mean she doesn't seek spiritual support, which might increase her risk since religious beliefs can be protective. So that might be medium.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like education, living situation, urban background, and mental state are significant. She has some protective factors too, but overall, the combination suggests a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues in the criminal justice system which can increase risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions may indicate lower likelihood of future recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_size\", \"medium\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight might influence behavior or target selection\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could provide more opportunities for criminal activity\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and employment can increase risk factors associated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate higher risk of behavioral issues or self-incident crimes\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing and foster care exposure can be linked to higher criminality risks\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God might reduce protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
