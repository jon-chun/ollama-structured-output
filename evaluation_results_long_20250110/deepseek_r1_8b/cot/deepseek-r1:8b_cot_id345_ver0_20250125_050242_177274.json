    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person who's a 20-year-old male. He has a history of arrest and conviction, which immediately makes me think he might be at higher risk for recidivism. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographic: White male, 5'7\", 128 lbs. Not sure about the weight's significance here, but height is usually not a big indicator on its own. He's never been married and lives alone. Not being married might be a risk factor because it can sometimes correlate with higher criminal activity, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nHe has a high school diploma, which is positive because education can reduce the likelihood of recidivism. He's not enrolled in college, so maybe that's a point against him since continuing education could help in reducing crime.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs this year. That seems like a good sign; employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which are protective factors against recidivism.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years. Current drug use, even if it's just marijuana, is often associated with higher criminal activity. But he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mitigate some risk.\n\nHe grew up in a rural area with both biological parents. Rural areas can have different crime rates and community influences. Having both parents at home might provide some level of supervision or stability, but I'm not sure how that affects future behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could be a protective factor if it leads to a more structured life or adherence to rules, but sometimes religious beliefs can also be used to justify actions, so it's a bit of an unclear factor.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted, which is a strong indicator that he's already had some run-ins with the law. That suggests higher risk.\n\nPutting this all together: His age is 20, which is relatively young but not extremely high in terms of recidivism risk. He has criminal history, which is a significant factor. His employment seems positive, but drug use is a negative. His upbringing and religious beliefs are mixed. So overall, I think he's at medium to high risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards Medium High because he's had an arrest and conviction, uses drugs, and while there are some protective factors like employment and education, the criminal history is pretty substantial. But maybe not the highest, considering his positive attributes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
