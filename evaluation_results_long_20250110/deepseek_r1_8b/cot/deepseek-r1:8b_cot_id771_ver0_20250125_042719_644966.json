    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who has been arrested three times and convicted. The user wants me to assign a low, medium, or high weight to each factor based on how it contributes to rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given. He's Hispanic, 5'11\", 160 lbs. Never married, not living alone, has a high school diploma, working one job, hasn't used drugs in four years, not feeling depressed lately. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two. He doesn't believe in God.\n\nI need to consider each factor and assess its weight. \n\n1. Age: 22 is relatively young; younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might lack impulse control or opportunities for positive reinforcement.\n2. Gender: Male, which statistically correlates with higher recidivism compared to females.\n3. Criminal history: He's been arrested three times and convicted, so that's a strong indicator of past criminal behavior, likely increasing the risk.\n4. Employment: Holding one job is positive; it suggests he has some stability, which can deter further criminal activity.\n5. Drug use: No drug use in four years is a plus as substance abuse is a common contributor to recidivism.\n6. Mental health: Not feeling depressed could be either neutral or beneficial if there's an underlying issue that could lead to criminal behavior.\n7. Family background: Growing up with a single mother might have influenced his environment, possibly increasing risk due to potential neglect or exposure to crime.\n8. Religion: Not believing in God might remove a potential deterrent mechanism for some individuals.\n\nNow, weighing each factor:\n\n- **Criminal history** is definitely high because past convictions are strong predictors.\n- **Age** is medium-high since younger people tend to recast more.\n- **Gender** is medium-high as males are more likely.\n- **Family background** is medium-high due to potential negative influences from childhood.\n- **Employment** is low because stability can reduce recidivism but it's not the strongest factor alone.\n- **Drug use** is low since abstinence reduces immediate risks.\n- **Mental health** is low unless there's a known issue, which isn't indicated here.\n- **Religion** is low as it's a minor factor compared to others.\n\nAdding these up, the total risk seems high. So, predicting a \"YES\" with confidence around 70% makes sense because while some factors are positive (job, no drugs), the criminal history and demographic factors outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases recidivism risk due to lack of maturity and impulse control\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Past arrests and convictions strongly predict future behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Household size and structure can influence criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Job stability can reduce recidivism but isn't a strong predictor alone\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed is neutral unless there's underlying issues not indicated here\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief is minor compared to other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
