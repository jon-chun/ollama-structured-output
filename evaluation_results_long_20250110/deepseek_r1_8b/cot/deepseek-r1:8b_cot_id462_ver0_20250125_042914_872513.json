    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his information step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male. I know that race can sometimes be a factor in criminal justice systems, but I'm not entirely sure how it weighs here. Maybe it's more about socioeconomic factors related to race rather than the color itself.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. That might indicate some educational limitations, which could be linked to higher recidivism rates because education is a protective factor against crime. So that seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests themselves don't necessarily predict future behavior, but the fact that he's been caught before could be a sign of higher risk. Maybe this falls under \"prior criminal history,\" which I've heard is a significant factor. So, that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis employment status: he's held two jobs in the past year. That's a positive sign because stable employment can reduce the likelihood of recidivism. So that should be a low or maybe medium risk factor depending on how much weight it's given.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, is often linked to higher recidivism. The feeling down could indicate emotional stress or instability, which might increase risk. So that's a high factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Also, growing up in a single-parent household might contribute to higher risk factors like socioeconomic disadvantages. That's probably a medium or high risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: he considers God involved in his life. Religion can be a protective factor by providing social support and moral frameworks. So that's low risk.\n\nHe lives alone now. Living alone might mean less supervision and more access to certain risks, but it could also indicate independence. I'm not sure how much weight this should have, maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't been married and has no kids, so family structure is another factor. Single males without children might have different risk profiles than those with family responsibilities.\n\nPutting all these together: prior arrests (high), drug use (high), living in urban area (medium-high?), educational status (medium), employment (low?), religious beliefs (low). \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the exact weights. Maybe I should assign higher weights to factors that are more directly linked to recidivism. Prior criminal history and substance abuse are big ones, so those would be high. Employment is protective, so low. Family structure might be medium if living alone is a risk.\n\nSo, risk factors ranked as:\n\n1. Prior Criminal History: High\n2. Drug Use: High\n3. Arrests: Maybe another factor? Wait, he's been arrested but not convicted. So prior arrests without convictions\u2014how does that weigh in? It's more of a potential indicator than a conviction. So maybe medium.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again:\n\n- Prior Criminal History (arrests): High\n- Drug Use: High\n- Family Structure (urban, single-parent): Medium\n- Education: Medium\n- Employment: Low\n- Religion: Low\n\nSo each of these factors would have a weight: high, high, medium, medium, low, low.\n\nNow, for prediction, I think if multiple high risk factors are present, the prediction is more likely to be \"YES.\" So with two high factors (prior arrests and drug use), plus some mediums, it's probably a \"YES\" with high confidence.\n\nConfidence would be based on how strong these predictors are. Since prior criminal history and substance abuse are strong predictors, I might say 80% or higher confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_criminal_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
