    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who hasn't been convicted yet but has a history of arrest. Let me start by going through each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, 5'8\" and 155 lbs. His living situation is alone, which might mean he doesn't have the kind of support that could prevent him from reoffending. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe he lacks further education, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year, which is positive because having a job can reduce the chances of recidivism by providing structure and income. However, he's been using drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use, especially in the past month, could indicate that his drug usage is still a factor contributing to criminal behavior.\n\nHe comes from a family with both biological parents, living in an urban area as part of a household of five. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or might lead to different stressors compared to smaller families. However, the fact that he considers God has nothing to do with his personal life might indicate a lack of religious or spiritual beliefs, which some studies show can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nSince he hasn't been convicted yet, it's hard to assess his criminal history beyond the arrest. His age is 19, which is relatively young and could mean higher impulsivity, but it's also possible he's matured since then.\n\nI need to assign weights: low, medium, or high. For each factor, I'll think about how significant it might be in predicting rearrest.\n\n1. **Race**: White is often overrepresented in the criminal justice system, so this could be a medium risk.\n2. **Age**: 19 might be on the lower end for adult recidivism, but not too low either\u2014maybe medium.\n3. **Employment**: Having two jobs is good, so this is a protective factor; maybe low.\n4. **Drug Use**: Recent drug use is high risk.\n5. **Family Structure**: Growing up in a larger family might be neutral or slightly positive\u2014could be low.\n6. **Religious Beliefs**: Lack of belief in God might be medium risk as it could affect social support.\n7. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Living alone might be medium, as independence without positive influences can be risky.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risk factors are drug use and age. His employment is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Without a criminal conviction, but with an arrest and drug history, I lean towards higher recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning based on overrepresentation in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may increase impulsivity\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Two jobs indicate stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Household size may provide some support or neutral influence\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief might reduce protective factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without positive influences could be risky\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
