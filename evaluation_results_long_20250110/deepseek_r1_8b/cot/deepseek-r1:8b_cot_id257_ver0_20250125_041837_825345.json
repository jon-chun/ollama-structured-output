    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me start by going through each part of her history step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's 5'5\" and weighs 120 lbs. That's on the lower side for someone her age, maybe indicating she's not taking care of herself physically. I wonder if that's a sign of potential stress or other issues.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone now. Living alone at 18 might mean she doesn't have a strong support system. It could also lead to more risk-taking behaviors since she's not surrounded by others who can check in on her or provide guidance.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is positive because it suggests she's motivated and perhaps less likely to engage in criminal activities. But she's only held two jobs this year, so maybe her work situation isn't stable, which could be a stressor.\n\nDrug use is another big factor here. She has used marijuana in the past four years, and recently she's been feeling down. That combination can be risky because drug use often correlates with higher risk-taking behaviors or criminal recidivism. Feeling down or having mood issues could also increase her likelihood of getting involved in more negative activities.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of six. That's a big family, which might have provided some support, but it could also mean she learned to handle things on her own from a younger age. Sometimes, growing up in large families can lead to different socialization patterns that might not be as nurturing.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That's a bit of an unknown factor.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5979\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd8\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e86\u89e3\u5979\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u4ef0\u7684\u3002\n\nHer criminal history is limited to one arrest without a conviction, so she might not have a significant criminal record, which could lower her risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: her drug use and current mood issues are high risks. Living alone and having only two jobs could be medium risks. The rest of her background, like school enrollment, family size, and lack of marriage, might balance some of those out but aren't as significant individually. Her religion is a bit uncertain but could either help or hinder, so I'm not sure about its weight yet.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high-risk factors are drug use and mood issues. The others are medium to low. I think she has a higher chance of rearrest, so my prediction would lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence around 70-80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"current_mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and using drugs increases risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and past history raise recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"No support system may lead to higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"School enrollment shows positive engagement\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"Large family background might offer resilience\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married but living alone is neutral factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
