    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old female's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a White woman, which is just basic demographic info. I don't know if race has a significant impact on recidivism, but I think it might be more about socioeconomic factors and other variables.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. That suggests some criminal history, so that's probably a medium or high risk factor. Maybe since she's been arrested before, she's more likely to reoffend.\n\nHer height is 5'5\" and weight is 140 lbs. Not sure how physical stats directly affect recidivism, but maybe in terms of employment or substance abuse? I don't know yet.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Divorce can sometimes be a stressor, and living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that could help her avoid criminal behavior. So this could be medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher crime rates because it limits job opportunities and may lead to socioeconomic struggles. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity as people might resort to illegal means for income. So this is probably another high risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but she felt down and depressed recently. The lack of drug use could lower some risks, but the depression might indicate higher stress levels that could lead to criminal behavior. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area when young. Growing up in a large urban family might mean exposure to certain influences or environments that increase crime rates. This is likely a high risk factor due to environmental factors.\n\nHer belief in God's involvement in her personal life. Religion can influence behavior, but I'm not sure if it directly correlates to criminality. It might provide support against crime, so maybe low risk here.\n\nPutting this all together: Criminal history (medium), lack of education and unemployment (high each), living situation (medium), depression (medium), past environment (high), and religion (low). The prediction would lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence because multiple high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrests and convictions indicate some risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Depression may lead to stress-related criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban background and large family size can expose to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may reduce risk through social support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is divorced and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year.
