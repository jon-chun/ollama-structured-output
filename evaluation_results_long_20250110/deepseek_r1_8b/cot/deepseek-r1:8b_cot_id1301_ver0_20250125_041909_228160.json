    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person and predict if she'll be rearrested in three years. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black female. I know that being a young adult can increase risk because they might have less experience with decision-making. Being Black is a factor too; there are unfortunately disparities in the criminal justice system, so that could be a high risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted, which means she's already had some run-ins. Prior convictions usually predict future behavior, so that should be high.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'1\" and 135 lbs. Not sure how much height and weight affect risk, but maybe being smaller could make her more vulnerable in situations. I'll mark that as medium.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system some people do, which could be a medium risk factor because there's no one around to help or monitor her activities.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher crime rates, so that's probably high risk.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Employment can be stabilizing, but since it's only two jobs and not necessarily long-term, maybe medium impact on reducing future arrests.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a predictor of criminal behavior unless it leads to other issues like theft or violence. Since she hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe that use is less concerning right now. I'll go with medium risk here.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month. Mental health can be a factor\u2014good mental health might reduce risk, so medium here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with five people. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences. Also, growing up in a large family might mean more exposure to conflict or stress. That's a high factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religiosity can influence behavior\u2014those who feel guided by a higher power might make different choices. It could either increase or decrease risk depending on how it affects decision-making, so medium.\n\nPutting this all together: age and race are high, prior convictions are high, education is high, living situation is medium, employment is medium, drug use is medium, mental health is medium, family background is high, and religious beliefs are medium. \n\nSo the prediction would be YES with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases risk of poor decision-making and antisocial behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Racial disparities in criminal justice system increase recidivism risk for Black individuals.'),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions indicate higher likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Having held 2 jobs may provide some stability but not enough to negate arrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate higher risk, especially if linked to other issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Good mental health reduces risk; she reports no depression currently.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing and large household expose her to stress and negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may guide behavior but effect on recidivism is uncertain.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
