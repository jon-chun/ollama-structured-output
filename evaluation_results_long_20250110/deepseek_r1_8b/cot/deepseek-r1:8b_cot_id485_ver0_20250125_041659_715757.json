    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this 18-year-old male being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old, which is fairly young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might make poorer decisions. So I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that race can be a risk factor, but in some places it's not considered because of legal reasons. But from what I've studied, being White doesn't always correlate with higher recidivism, so maybe this isn't a major factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That suggests he might have had contact with the criminal justice system before, which could indicate some tendencies towards illegal behavior. So I'll consider this as medium risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and between 150-174 lbs. I'm not sure how physical build factors into recidivism. Maybe if someone is smaller or bigger, it affects how they engage in criminal activities? Not too clear on this one. Maybe low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support of a family or significant other, which can lead to higher risk behaviors. So that could be medium.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a strong protective factor. People who are engaged in their education are less likely to get involved in criminal activities. So this should lower his risk; maybe low.\n\nHe has held one job in the past year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, reducing the chances of recidivism. So that's another protective factor, perhaps medium to low.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Even though it's only marijuana, it shows he's involved in illegal activities, which can lead to more arrests. This should be high risk.\n\nSome months ago, he felt really down and nothing could cheer him up. That sounds like depression or similar mental health issues. Mental health problems can lead to higher recidivism because they might commit crimes to cope with their emotions. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four. Larger families can provide more support, which reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. But he has other factors that might outweigh this, so maybe low here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the role of religion in his life. I'm not sure how religious beliefs affect recidivism. Maybe without spiritual guidance, someone might have less reason to avoid crime. So perhaps medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high from drug use and mental health, high from age, moderate from arrest history and living situation, lower from education and employment, low from family size, and maybe medium for beliefs. The main high factors are age, drug use, and mental health.\n\nSo overall, the prediction is YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and decision-making flaws\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a factor, legal considerations often mitigate its impact in some regions\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrest suggests potential for further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Physical build doesn't significantly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school can reduce recidivism through education and structure\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment provides stability, reducing criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana indicates involvement in illegal activities\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression increases risk of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"Larger families often provide more support, reducing recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Without religious beliefs, there may be less internal motivation to avoid crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
