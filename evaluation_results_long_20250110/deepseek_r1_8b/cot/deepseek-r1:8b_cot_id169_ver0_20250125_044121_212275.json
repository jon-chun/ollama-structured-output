    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each part of his history step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which might relate to some demographic factors. Then, he has a criminal history: three arrests and at least one conviction. That seems significant because a history of convictions often correlates with higher recidivism rates. He's 6'0\" and 210 lbs., so he's on the heavier side. I'm not sure how BMI ties into recidivism, but being overweight can sometimes be a risk factor for other health issues, which might not directly impact criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone now. Living alone might make it harder to get support systems in place, which could increase risks. He has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education level is important; lower education levels are often linked to higher rates of criminal activity because employment opportunities might be limited.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having a job might reduce his risk compared to someone without it. He's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is a risk factor, but if he's not currently depressed, that might mitigate some risks.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Living in an urban environment can expose him to more crime and social disorder, which might increase his risk. He believes God has something to do with his life personally. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support or social ties that reduce criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, the key factors seem to be criminal history, education level, employment status, drug use, living situation, and upbringing. His criminal history is definitely a high risk factor because he's been convicted before, which strongly predicts recidivism. Education being only a high school diploma is another high factor as it limits opportunities. Employment might help, so that could be medium.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is also a high factor since substance abuse often ties into criminal behavior. His living situation alone and not married can be medium risks because isolation might increase chances for criminal acts. Growing up urban is another medium risk due to higher exposure to crime. Religiosity could be a protective low factor.\n\nSo, combining these, his history of convictions, limited education, drug use, and urban background are significant. His job and current mental state provide some mitigation, but not enough to outweigh the high-risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested and convicted multiple times increases the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Limited education can reduce employment opportunities and increase risk for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Current employment provides stability, reducing risk factors associated with unemployment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Previous marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and higher exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may increase exposure to crime and delinquent peers\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence can provide moral support, potentially reducing criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
