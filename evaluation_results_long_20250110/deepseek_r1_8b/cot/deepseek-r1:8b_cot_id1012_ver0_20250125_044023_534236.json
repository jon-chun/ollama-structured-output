    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, her demographic: she's Black, 5'6\", weighs between 150-174 lbs. She hasn't married yet and lives alone. Not having a high school diploma or GED might affect her job prospects and opportunities, which could relate to recidivism. Plus, she isn't enrolled in college, so maybe no structured environment.\n\nHer criminal history is minimal\u2014only one arrest and conviction. So that's a low risk there, unless the conviction was for something serious, but since it's not specified, I'll assume it's minor.\n\nShe has used drugs recently: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and some months back she felt really down. Depression can be a trigger for criminal behavior or relapse, so that might increase risk.\n\nHer upbringing was in a large urban household with her biological mother. Growing up in an urban area could expose her to more crime influences. Also, she believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes, which might influence her decisions or how she deals with stress.\n\nPutting this together: criminal history is low, drug use is moderate, educational status is high risk, and emotional state and upbringing are medium. So overall, I think the prediction leans towards YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"She has a minimal criminal history with one arrest and conviction.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"She lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which can hinder job opportunities and increase risk factors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"She has used drugs recently (marijuana and cocaine) and experienced emotional distress in the past month\"),\n    (\"upbringing_and_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"She grew up in an urban area with her biological mother and holds religious beliefs that may influence her decisions\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health factors like depression can contribute to criminal behavior, but it's not explicitly detailed here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
