    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old female who has a history of arrests and convictions. Let's break down each part of her background step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 21 years old, which is relatively young in terms of criminal justice involvement. Being White might be a demographic factor that could influence sentencing or recidivism rates, but I'm not sure if it's directly correlated here. She has been arrested nine times and convicted, so that's a significant history indicating higher risk.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and 105 lbs. Not sure how physical stature plays into this, but being underweight can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors, though it's speculative.\n\nMarital status: never married and not living alone. Living with others might provide support or supervision, which could affect her likelihood of reoffending.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Lack of further education is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it limits employment opportunities and increases stress levels.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. Stable employment can reduce criminal behavior, so this might lower her risk compared to others with similar backgrounds.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use is a known predictor of recidivism, especially if she's using it currently or recently.\n\nDepression: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can lead to criminal behavior, so not reporting depression might indicate lower risk here.\n\nFamily background: She lived with her mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, might expose her to more influences that could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: She doesn't believe God affects her personally. Religiosity is often linked to lower recidivism because it provides moral support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting this all together, factors like past convictions, drug use, lack of education, and family background seem highly relevant. These might tip the scale towards higher risk. The employment and current mental health (lack of depression) could mitigate some of that risk. Overall, I think she's at high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is often correlated with higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White demographic may have different recidivism rates compared to others\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests and convictions indicate a high risk\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't directly correlate to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide support or supervision\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without further education is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"One job held during the year can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression may indicate lower risk in this area\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban family background increases exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Non-belief in God may reduce reliance on religious support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
