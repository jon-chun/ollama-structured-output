    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, her demographics: she's White, which might have some impact based on existing data, but I'm not sure if it's high, medium, or low. I think it could be low since being White isn't always a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. That seems like a medium risk factor because a history of arrests often correlates with higher recidivism, even if there are no convictions yet.\n\nHer height is 5'6\" and weight is 190 lbs. I don't know how relevant physical size is, so maybe low. It doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior as far as I can tell.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. That could be medium because living with others might provide more structure or supervision, which reduces risk. Not being married also might mean she has less support, increasing the risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. A high school diploma is positive, so maybe low. Education can be protective against crime.\n\nShe's held one job this year. Employment is usually seen as a protective factor, so that could be medium to high because it indicates she has some stability which might reduce criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs and not being depressed are both positive signs, so those should be low risk factors.\n\nAt 22, she's considered young, and living with both parents in a household of six as a child. A big family might provide more support or supervision, which could lower recidivism risk, so maybe medium to high. But I'm not sure if it's high because the exact impact isn't clear.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That's interesting. Religiosity can be a protective factor in some cases, so that might be low or medium depending on how it influences her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, I think each of these factors contributes differently. Arrest history is significant, so that's high. Employment adds stability, so medium. Never married and not living alone could increase risk, so maybe medium. Education is good, so low. No drug use and no depression are both positives, so low. Big family might help, but since she's 22 and now on her own, perhaps it's medium. Religiosity is probably low.\n\nSo the prediction would be NO because most factors are protective or neutral, but I'm not 100% confident because the arrest history is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Family Structure During Adolescence\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
