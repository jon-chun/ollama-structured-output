    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood that this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let's start by looking at each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I'm not sure how relevant his ethnicity is in terms of recidivism, but I think it might be related to systemic issues or community factors that could influence his chances. Maybe I'll assign this a medium risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests, one conviction. Prior convictions usually increase the likelihood of future rearrests, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6'2\" and weight is 160 lbs. Not sure how physical stats affect recidivism directly, but maybe in terms of substance abuse or job opportunities, which are factors here. I'll consider it a low to medium factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to social isolation, which might increase the risk of getting involved in criminal activities again. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big indicator for recidivism because it limits job prospects and increases the chances of involvement in the criminal justice system again. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year, which adds to the problem by reducing his economic stability. Economic hardship is known to contribute to criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as high.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Substance abuse is a significant factor for recidivism. The recent depression could indicate instability or stress that might lead to criminal behavior again. This is definitely a high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can expose him to more crime and may increase his chances of reoffending. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal activity, so this is another high risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but it's unclear how this affects recidivism. Maybe it provides some support or structure, which could reduce risk, or maybe it's a coping mechanism that doesn't address the underlying issues. I'm not sure, so I'll consider it low.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are: ethnicity (medium), prior arrests/convictions (high), physical stats (low), living alone (medium), education (high), employment (high), substance abuse/depression (high), upbringing (high), and religious beliefs (low).\n\nNow, considering how these factors interact. He has a history of arrest and conviction, which is the strongest indicator here. Substance abuse and lack of education and employment further exacerbate the risk. Living in an urban area where crime is more prevalent also plays a role. However, his belief in God might offer some protective factors or social support that could reduce his chances.\n\nI think the overall risk is quite high because multiple high-weighted factors are present, like prior convictions, substance abuse, lack of education, and living in an urban area. Even though he's not currently employed or has low education, those are big red flags for recidivism.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards a high confidence that he will be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut identity may influence systemic issues\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to social isolation\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases criminal justice involvement\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs reduce economic stability, contributing to crime\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_depression\", \"high\", \"Recent substance use and depression increase risk\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing may expose him to more crime opportunities\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might offer support or coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
