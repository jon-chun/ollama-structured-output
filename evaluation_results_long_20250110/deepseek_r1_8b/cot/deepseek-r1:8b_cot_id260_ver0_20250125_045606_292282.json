    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. I know that in the criminal justice system, there are disparities, so being Black might be a medium risk factor because of higher rates of incarceration and potential recidivism.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 180 lbs. Maybe his weight doesn't directly correlate much with crime risk, but being young could be a factor. I'll assign this as low since it doesn't seem significant.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone might mean he has more access to commit crimes without supervision, so that could be medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can deter crime, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe held one job this year. Employment is usually stabilizing, so that's another low.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and feels down every month. Drug use itself isn't always bad, but frequent use and feeling down could be signs of higher risk, maybe medium to high.\n\nHe lived with his mother in an urban area as a kid. Urban environments often have more crime opportunities, so that's a medium risk.\n\nHe believes God affects his life personally. Religiosity can influence behavior, sometimes reducing crime, but if it's a strong belief, it might help, so maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks seem to be drug use and living in an urban area with a supportive family history. The rest are lower factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face higher rates of incarceration and recidivism due to systemic issues\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age may not inherently increase risk, but context matters\"),\n    (\"body_type\", \"low\", \"Physical build doesn't directly correlate with crime risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase opportunities for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school can be a stabilizing factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job, indicating some responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and emotional distress may indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother may expose to crime-prone environments\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
