    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk based on the given criteria. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Being a young adult male could be a factor in criminal behavior, but it's not definitive on its own. However, considering he has been arrested and convicted before, that adds to the concern.\n\nHe's had four arrests and been convicted, which suggests prior criminal history. That's a significant red flag because it indicates he's already engaged in illegal activities. The number of arrests (four) might also point towards higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history.\n\nHis physical description: 6'2\" and 190 lbs. While height and weight can vary, there's not much here that stands out as a direct indicator of risk, unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone now. Living alone at his age could mean he's more independent, but it doesn't inherently pose a high risk. It might even indicate he's focusing on self-improvement or education.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently, which shows he's engaged in productive activities. Education can be a mitigating factor against criminal behavior, but again, prior arrests complicate this.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the year. Employment is generally seen as a positive indicator, providing stability and structure. This could reduce his risk compared to someone without employment or unstable work history.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a concerning factor. It's associated with higher risks of criminal behavior, including violence and property crimes. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate that his mental health isn't currently impaired, but drug use itself remains a high-risk factor.\n\nAt a young age (presumably 4), he lived in group quarters in an urban area. Growing up in a crowded environment can sometimes correlate with higher exposure to criminal influences or stressors, though it's not determinative on its own.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This lack of spiritual belief could be a protective factor or a risk factor depending on context. Sometimes, religious beliefs are associated with lower recidivism rates because they provide moral support and community ties. Without such beliefs, there might be less internal accountability, increasing the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests and convictions, which is a strong indicator of higher risk. The drug use also adds to this concern. While having a job and being enrolled in school are positive signs, they may not sufficiently offset his criminal history and substance abuse issues. The lack of spiritual belief might further increase the risk by reducing potential inhibitors against reoffending.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's likely that he does pose a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
