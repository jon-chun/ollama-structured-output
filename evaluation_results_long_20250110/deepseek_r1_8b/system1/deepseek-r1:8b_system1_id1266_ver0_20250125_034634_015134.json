    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrest history can be indicative of higher risk, especially if there are prior incidents. But since she hasn't been convicted, it might not be as direct a factor unless there's a pattern.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic and is 5'2\" weighing between 125-149 lbs. Demographics alone aren't conclusive, but being Hispanic could be associated with higher risk in some contexts, though not always directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't married yet and lives alone, which might indicate she's independent, possibly reducing risk factors related to social support or family influences. However, living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if there are fewer checks in place.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor, as it's often linked to higher rates of criminal activity and drug use. Not being in college suggests she might not have stable income or support systems, which could contribute to further issues.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Recent use is concerning, especially if she feels down during the past month. Drug use itself is a risk factor, and feeling hopeless or depressed can sometimes lead to more criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment might have exposed her to different stressors and influences, which could contribute to higher risk factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can sometimes influence behavior, but it's unclear if this would lead to criminal activity or if it might provide support against it.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: arrest history, drug use, educational status, living situation, and family background. The combination of being arrested, using drugs, lacking education, and potentially having access to urban stressors could increase her risk. However, without a prior conviction, it's not certain. Still, the presence of multiple high-risk indicators suggests a higher likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
