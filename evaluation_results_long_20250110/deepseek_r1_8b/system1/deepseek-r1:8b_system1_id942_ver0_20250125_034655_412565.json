    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's just demographic info, not necessarily a risk factor itself. Next, he has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction isn't a strong indicator of higher risk, though it does show some involvement with the legal system.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 155 lbs. That doesn't really contribute to risk assessment. His marital status\u2014never married and living alone\u2014is common among young adults and doesn't inherently pose a high risk. Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college could be neutral or even positive if he's working.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year, which is a positive indicator of stability. However, he admits to using drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially recent use. But here, it's specified as \"past four years,\" so maybe not the most current usage.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression could increase risk of certain behaviors but isn't directly linked unless there's more context about how he's coping with that. At a young age, living with both biological parents in an urban area might have exposed him to different environments or stressors, but without knowing if those experiences were positive or negative, it's hard to assess.\n\nReligiously, he believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could indicate a sense of control or a belief system that might influence his behavior, but again, the direction isn't clear.\n\nPutting this together: He has a history of arrest and drug use, which are moderate risk factors. The absence of current depression and some positive indicators like employment suggest he's functioning relatively well. However, drug use is a concerning factor, especially if it's recent. Since the last usage was within four years, it's not clear if it's current or active.\n\nIn risk assessment, one arrest without a conviction isn't enough to label him as high risk unless there are more aggravating factors. His stable employment and lack of recent depression might mitigate some risks. The drug use needs more context\u2014frequency and impact on his life.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while there are some red flags like past drug use and an arrest, the overall picture doesn't strongly indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
