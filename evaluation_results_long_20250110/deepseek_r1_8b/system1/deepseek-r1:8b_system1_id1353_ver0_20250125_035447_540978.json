    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to break this down step by step. So, the user provided a scenario about a person and wants me to determine if they pose a high risk based on certain factors.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's an important demographic factor because race can sometimes be a contributing factor in criminal justice risk assessments, though it's a sensitive area.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. This suggests he might have had interactions with the legal system without a formal conviction, which could indicate higher risk factors like involvement in the criminal justice system or potential for future offenses.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 170 lbs. Not sure how much that factors into risk assessment beyond maybe overall health or mobility, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and is living with someone, so he doesn't have the responsibilities of marriage or potentially a stable environment that might deter criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having only a GED can be a risk factor as education levels are often correlated with lower rates of criminality, but since he's not in college, it might indicate higher risk if he's not pursuing further education or employment stability.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year. That's a positive indicator because stable employment is linked to lower recidivism rates. People with steady work are less likely to engage in criminal activities.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent use within the past month makes it more concerning as current substance use can increase risk of offenses. Plus, feeling down or hopeless could be a sign of mental health issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a rural area when he was young. Rural areas sometimes have different crime rates and living in a household with a parent might offer some protection, but it's not clear if that environment had any negative influences.\n\nReligious beliefs, particularly about God's influence on personal outcomes, could be a protective factor or maybe a coping mechanism, but it's hard to assess without more context.\n\nPutting this all together: He has arrest history, current substance use, feels down, and some education and employment history. His lack of college enrollment and past drug use are concerning. The fact that he hasn't been convicted doesn't mean he's not a risk. The presence of mental health indicators adds to the concern.\n\nI'm leaning towards YES because several high-risk factors are present: criminal history (though no conviction), substance abuse, potential mental health issues, and some educational/employment factors that might contribute to higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
