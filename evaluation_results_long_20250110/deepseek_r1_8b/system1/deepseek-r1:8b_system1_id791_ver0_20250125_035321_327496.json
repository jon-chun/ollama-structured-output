    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it's not necessarily indicative of high risk.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. A criminal history is definitely a significant factor. Having arrests and a conviction increases the likelihood of further criminal behavior because prior convictions are often predictors of recidivism.\n\nHer physical description isn't directly relevant here, but her marital status might be. She's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal activity, as it may provide stability and support.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a concerning factor because it limits employment opportunities and can contribute to higher risk behaviors. Unemployment can lead to financial stressors, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activities.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another red flag because it can lead to issues like money troubles, which may push someone towards criminal behavior for survival or other reasons.\n\nIn the past four years, she used marijuana. Drug use, especially recent use, is a risk factor as it's associated with higher rates of criminal behavior. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Sometimes, substance abuse can be a coping mechanism for mental health issues, but if she's not currently experiencing depression, it might reduce some risks.\n\nShe grew up in a household of five with both biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a large family in a rural setting might have its own set of challenges or protective factors, depending on the family dynamics and economic status, which isn't provided here. But without more info, I can't make an assumption.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can be both protective and risk-increasing, depending on how it's expressed. If it leads to positive behaviors or support networks, it might be protective. If it's used in a way that justifies criminal behavior (like religious justification for certain actions), it could increase risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is a strong indicator. Lack of education and unemployment can contribute to higher risks. Recent drug use is concerning. While she isn't currently depressed, past use and lack of education are factors that often go hand-in-hand with criminal behavior. The absence of current depression might slightly mitigate some risks but not enough to override the other high-risk factors.\n\nSo, considering all these points, it's likely that there's a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
