    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 21-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male who's had two arrests and one conviction. That's a concerning start because prior criminal history often correlates with higher risk. But I should consider the nature of those arrests\u2014were they minor infractions or more serious offenses? The info doesn't specify, so I have to go with what's given.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 160 lbs. Not particularly notable physically, but weight can sometimes be a factor in health-related risks, though it's not directly linked here unless combined with other factors like substance use.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't uncommon, but it could indicate potential social isolation or higher risk-taking behaviors since he might have fewer supports in place.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Limited education can sometimes be a risk factor, especially if combined with other issues like substance abuse or criminal history.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment is often seen as a stabilizing factor, so having only one job might not be as concerning unless it's inconsistent or indicates instability.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use of cocaine can be particularly problematic and may indicate higher risk behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which could mean he's managing his substance use better currently.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. Rural backgrounds can sometimes have different social dynamics, but without more info on whether there were issues in the household or family history of crime, it's hard to assess.\n\nReligiously, he considers God plays a role in his life personally. Religion can be a protective factor if it provides support or discourages criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Criminal history is a big red flag. His age and living situation aren't inherently risky on their own, but paired with substance use, they might increase risk. The recent drug use (especially cocaine) could indicate higher propensity for high-risk behaviors. However, the lack of depression might mean he's not currently dealing with emotional issues that could exacerbate risk.\n\nI'm a bit torn because while his criminal history is significant, other factors like his current mental state and employment might mitigate some risks. But given the two arrests and conviction, it leans towards higher risk. I think I'll go with YES, but maybe with lower confidence since there are some positives like no recent depression and stable housing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
