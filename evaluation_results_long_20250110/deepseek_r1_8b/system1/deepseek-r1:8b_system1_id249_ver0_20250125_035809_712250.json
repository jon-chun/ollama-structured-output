    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but I don't know how much that alone contributes. Maybe more about behavior or history?\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. So he has a criminal record, which is a red flag for risk assessment. The fact that he was arrested and convicted suggests he might have higher propensity for similar behaviors in the future.\n\nHis physical build is 5'9\" and between 225-249 lbs. That's considered overweight or obese, but I don't know how that directly ties to criminal behavior unless it's related to health issues affecting decisions.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Being single might not necessarily be a risk factor, but living alone could mean he doesn't have the same level of supervision or accountability as someone in a relationship or with family.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education can sometimes correlate with lower criminal activity, so that's a positive sign.\n\nHe held 3 jobs during the year. Employment is generally seen as a stabilizing factor, which might reduce risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Recent use of drugs could be concerning, especially if it's more than occasional use. However, not feeling depressed recently might indicate he's functioning well mentally right now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is usually better for development compared to environments with neglect or abuse. But urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could indicate a sense of control over events and possibly a different worldview that might affect decision-making processes.\n\nPutting it all together: he's been convicted, has criminal history, is using substances, but hasn't shown depression recently. He's employed and in school, which are positive signs. His upbringing was stable, and he believes in a higher power, which might influence his choices positively.\n\nSo, considering these factors, while there are some risks (criminal history and substance use), there are also mitigating factors that suggest he's not necessarily a high risk right now.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
