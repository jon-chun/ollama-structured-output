    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this risk factors for a criminal justice risk assessment. The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. He's been arrested once and convicted, so he has some criminal history. He's not married, lives alone, doesn't have a job, and hasn't been to college after getting his GED.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he was in a household with three adults who weren't his biological parents, living in an urban area. He also believes that God plays a role in his personal life.\n\nI need to assess whether these factors indicate high risk. First, criminal history is a big factor. He's been convicted, which suggests he's had contact with the justice system before. Being 22 and not enrolled in college or holding a job might point to higher risk factors like unemployment, which can correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nLiving in an urban area can contribute to higher crime rates due to more opportunities and possibly more exposure to criminal influences. The fact that he was raised in a non-traditional household without his biological parents could indicate potential instability or different socialization factors that might increase risk.\n\nHis substance use history is limited to marijuana within the past four years, which isn't as severe as, say, harder drugs, but it's still a factor. His religious beliefs about God's influence might affect decision-making or coping mechanisms, potentially increasing risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: criminal history, potential socioeconomic disadvantages (unemployment, not college), urban living, non-traditional upbringing, and substance use. These elements could collectively suggest a higher risk for reoffending.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
