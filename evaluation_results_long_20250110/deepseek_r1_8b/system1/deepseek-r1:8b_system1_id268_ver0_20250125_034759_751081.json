    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old male, Hispanic. Young age can sometimes be a factor but not always. Being Hispanic might have cultural implications, but without more context on how that affects risk, it's hard to say.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Multiple arrests suggest some history of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator. Past convictions mean he's had formal interactions with the justice system before.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 190 lbs. Not particularly tall or heavy, but body size isn't a direct risk factor unless it relates to other behaviors like physical activity or job holding.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risks if there are fewer supports in place, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which could be a risk factor for things like employment stability or involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the year. Stable employment can be a mitigating factor, indicating he's holding down work, which might suggest he's responsible or has some structure in his life.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is concerning, but not using drugs currently could mean he's seeking help or have moved away from substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment might have exposed him to different stressors or influences. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could contribute to the risk factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but it's unclear if this would protect him from criminal activity or increase it, depending on how he interprets divine intervention.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests and convictions, which is significant. Multiple arrests suggest he might have a pattern of behavior that could lead to further issues. His employment suggests some stability, but his past drug use is a concern. The lack of educational enrollment and living alone might contribute to higher risk factors like social isolation or economic stressors, which can sometimes correlate with criminal activity.\n\nSo considering all these points, especially the history of arrests and convictions, it seems likely that he does pose a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
