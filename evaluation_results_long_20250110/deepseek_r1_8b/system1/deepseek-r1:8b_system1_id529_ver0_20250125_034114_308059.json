    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors for someone who might be a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. That's a demographic factor, but alone it doesn't indicate high risk. \n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Two arrests and a conviction suggest some criminal history, which could be a risk factor. But I need to consider the nature of those arrests\u2014were they minor offenses or more serious? The question doesn't specify, so I'll note that as a potential concern.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 170 lbs. That's within a normal range, not particularly indicative of anything.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which is common for someone his age. Doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor, especially if it impacts job opportunities or leads to unemployment, which can increase criminal activity.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. That's positive; steady employment can reduce\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed recently. No recent drug use is good, but without knowing his past, it's hard to assess. Feeling not depressed is a positive sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a large family might have its challenges, but without more info on how that influenced him negatively, it's unclear.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could indicate religious beliefs, which can be protective or sometimes lead to different decision-making processes.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is a point of concern, lack of education is another, but positive employment and recent sobriety are mitigating factors. Without knowing the nature of arrests, I can't say it's definitely high risk. Maybe medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
