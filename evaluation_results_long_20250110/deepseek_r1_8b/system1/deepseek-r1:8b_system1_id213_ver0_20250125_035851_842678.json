Let me go through each point carefully.\n\nFirst, the person is Black and 5'9\" weighing 188 lbs. That's average, nothing too concerning physically. He has two arrests but no convictions, so he hasn't had any legal consequences yet. \n\nHe's single, living alone, which might be a red flag as it could indicate instability or lack of support. His educational status: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. That's concerning because education is a strong predictor for future behavior, especially without any job history mentioned.\n\nNo jobs during the year suggests he's either unemployed or not working consistently. Unemployment can increase risk factors like criminal behavior if other issues aren't addressed.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use can be a significant factor linked to higher risk behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign as depression often correlates with higher risks.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of two. That's a stable upbringing compared to single-parent or chaotic households, which might reduce some risks. He believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes, which could be a protective factor if it provides him with a sense of purpose or control.\n\nPutting this together: Two arrests without convictions, no education, no job, and recent drug use are all high-risk indicators. However, the lack of depression and a somewhat stable upbringing might mitigate some risks but not enough to offset the other factors. I think this points towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
