    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's go through this risk assessment step by step. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male with a history of four arrests and convictions. That\u2019s concerning because it shows he\u2019s had run-ins with the law before, which can be an indicator of higher risk.\n\nHe's living alone and separated, which might mean he lacks strong social support systems. Living alone can sometimes contribute to higher risk behaviors or isolation, though it's not always a direct indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having any jobs during the year could be a red flag as it suggests he might not have stable income or structure, which can sometimes lead to higher risk activities.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t used drugs in four years and hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently. That\u2019s positive because substance abuse and mental health issues are often linked to criminal behavior, so his lack of drug use and current mental state could mitigate some risks.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area with both biological parents. Urban environments can sometimes be higher stressors, but having both parents might have provided some level of support or supervision that might reduce risk compared to other family structures.\n\nHis lack of belief in God could indicate he doesn\u2019t rely on religious or spiritual networks for support, which might increase his risk compared to someone who does have such support systems.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some positive factors like no recent drug use and stable mental health, the four arrests and convictions are significant. The absence of college enrollment and lack of employment could also point towards higher risk behaviors or difficulties in leadings a lawful life. His current living situation and family background might offer some support but don\u2019t outweigh his criminal history.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, there is an indication that this person poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
