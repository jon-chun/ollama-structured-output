    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, she's never been convicted, only arrested once. That might lower the immediate risk since she hasn't had a criminal history beyond an arrest.\n\nShe has a stable job history with four jobs in the past year, which suggests she's responsible and has consistent income. That's a positive sign.\n\nShe's not using drugs now, and her last use was over four years ago. This indicates good behavior regarding substance abuse, which could mitigate risks.\n\nHer mental state is something to consider. She feels down sometimes and mentions feeling hopeless. While this isn't directly tied to criminality, persistent negative emotions can sometimes be a red flag for higher risk behaviors. However, without more specific information about her mental health being addressed or causing issues in her life, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's living with family, which provides support and structure. Living with relatives can buffer against certain risks compared to living alone or in unstable environments.\n\nHer educational background is a GED, not enrolled in college. While higher education isn't a direct risk factor, lacking further education could be a concern for future opportunities, but it doesn't necessarily correlate directly with criminal behavior.\n\nShe identifies as White and lived in an urban area as a child. Race and upbringing can influence perspectives, but without specific information on how these factors contribute to potential risks, it's hard to assess.\n\nHer religious beliefs might offer her some support or coping mechanisms, which could be positive in managing stress or negative emotions.\n\nConsidering all these points, she has some positive indicators like stable employment, no recent drug use, and family support. However, her mental state is a concern. Without more info on whether this affects her behavior, it's a bit unclear. But given the overall stability, I might lean towards a lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
