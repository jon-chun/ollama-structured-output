    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, age is a big factor. He's 21, which is in the prime age for getting into trouble. Younger people often have higher rates because they're still developing and might make impulsive decisions.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That means he hasn't had a formal conviction, so maybe he hasn't learned from that past mistake yet. But an arrest record itself can be a risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6'8\" and he weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant body size factors into recidivism, but being taller doesn't necessarily protect him from getting rearrested. So maybe this isn't a high factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has fewer people around to keep him accountable or provide support, which could increase his chances of making poor decisions again.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and lead to more criminal activity as a means of income. This seems like a significant risk factor because education is a strong protective factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Having steady employment suggests he might be motivated or have some structure, which could decrease the likelihood of recidivism. So maybe this is a positive factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed lately. Drug use itself can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent. However, his current mental state doesn't indicate ongoing issues, so perhaps this isn't as high of a risk right now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size four. Growing up in a single-parent family might have its challenges, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say if that's a significant risk factor here.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it provides moral support and community ties, which could deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Age is high, lack of education is high, history of drug use is medium, and some positive factors like current employment might mitigate some risks. His arrest record is low since he hasn't been convicted yet, but the fact that he was arrested once could still be a factor.\n\nSo, considering these, I think the risk factors are: age, lack of education, history of substance use, and maybe household size. Others seem less relevant or are positive.\n\nI'd assign high to age, high to lack of education, medium to substance use, low to current employment, and maybe low to living alone since it's a neutral factor here.\n\nBased on these weights, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it often correlates with impulsive behavior and limited decision-making\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of high school diploma or GED increases the likelihood of criminal activity due to limited job opportunities\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: History of marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"current_employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Having held two jobs suggests some stability which can reduce recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_young_age\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a household of four provides some familial support, though specifics are unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
