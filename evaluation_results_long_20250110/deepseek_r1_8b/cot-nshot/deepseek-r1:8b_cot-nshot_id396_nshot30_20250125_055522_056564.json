    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on what I know from the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the previous cases, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates, but it varies. I think medium weight makes sense here because while they're more likely, there are exceptions both ways.\n\nNext, she's White. In the examples, White individuals had a mix of outcomes, but it didn't consistently correlate with higher or lower risk. Maybe low weight because race alone doesn't determine recidivism much.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. From the data, having been arrested once and convicted seems to be a significant factor. In the examples, people with past convictions had medium to high risk. I'll go with high here because it's a clear indicator of prior criminal behavior.\n\nHer weight is 145 lbs, which is within a normal range. The examples didn't show a direct correlation between weight and recidivism, so I'll assign low weight to this factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Single status and living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors, but the data doesn't clearly show it. Maybe medium because being alone might mean less support, increasing the chance of getting into trouble again.\n\nShe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is generally seen as positive, but not having further education can sometimes be a risk factor. It's unclear here, so I'll go with low.\n\nShe held three jobs this year. Employment is usually a good indicator of lower recidivism because it provides structure. So, I'll give this a high weight because steady work can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and feels down most of the time. Drug use, especially recent, is a significant risk factor. Even though it's only marijuana, frequent use and feeling down are both indicators. High weight here makes sense.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological dad in an urban area. Family structure can influence behavior; having a stable family might reduce risk, but being in an urban area can increase exposure to crime. I'll assign medium because the family aspect is positive but the environment is negative.\n\nShe believes God has control over her life. Religious beliefs can be protective or sometimes lead to different coping mechanisms, which could either help or hinder behavior. It's unclear, so low weight seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors with high weights are: prior conviction, recent drug use, and employment. These seem like strong predictors of recidivism. The other factors don't have as clear an impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is younger, which may increase risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not significantly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of arrest and conviction increases likelihood\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight within normal range is not directly related\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_ged\", \"low\", \"GED shows some educational achievement, which is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and low mood are strong indicators\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\", \"medium\", \"Mixed impact from family and urban environment\"),\n    (\"religion_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs vary in their impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
