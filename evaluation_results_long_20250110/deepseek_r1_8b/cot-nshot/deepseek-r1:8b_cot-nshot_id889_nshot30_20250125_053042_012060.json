    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on what I know from the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the previous examples, younger people tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not have as much motivation or stability yet. So I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, his race is Black, which has been shown in studies to correlate with higher arrest rates and recidivism. So that's another high weight factor.\n\nHe has 19 arrests and convictions. That\u2019s a significant number, indicating a history of criminal behavior. High-weight here makes sense because more arrests often lead to more rearrests due to the cycle of the justice system.\n\nHe weighs 210 lbs, which is on the higher side. Obesity or being overweight can contribute to health issues, but I'm not sure how directly that affects recidivism. It might impact job opportunities or mental health, though. Maybe medium weight because it's a contributing factor but not as direct as others.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and lives alone now. Being single and living alone could be either good or bad. Without family support, he might have fewer ties to the community, increasing his chances of recidivism. So I think this is a high-weight factor because social isolation can lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a strong predictor against recidivism. Without it, he\u2019s less likely to find stable employment or improve his life circumstances, making rearrest more probable. So this is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nHe has held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and higher crime rates because without legitimate income, he might turn to illegal activities for survival. This is another high-weight factor as joblessness is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially in the context of higher crimes, is a significant factor. While it's just marijuana, it\u2019s still a substance abuse issue that can contribute to criminal behavior. So I'll give this a high weight because substance abuse is linked to recidivism.\n\nHe feels down and has some days where nothing cheers him up. Mental health issues like depression or anxiety can lead to more criminal behavior as people might act out when they're not coping well emotionally. This is another high-weight factor since mental health plays a role in decision-making and behavior.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area of size 8 when he was young. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can expose him to higher levels of crime and stress. Urban areas often have more resources for criminal activities and higher police presence, contributing to recidivism rates. So this is high-weight.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his life. This could be part of a support system or personal belief that might help him turn his life around. If he relies on faith, it might reduce his likelihood of rearrest by providing motivation and support. So I'll give this a low weight because religious beliefs can sometimes lead to positive outcomes.\n\nNow, putting all these together: age, race, prior arrests, weight, living alone, lack of education, no job, substance use, mental health issues, family background, and his faith.\n\nI think the factors that stand out as high risk are age, prior arrests, not having a job, no education, substance use, mental health, and family background. These all contribute significantly to recidivism.\n\nEven though he considers God in his life, which might help, it's outweighed by the other high-weight factors. So overall, I'm leaning towards him being rearrested again within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
