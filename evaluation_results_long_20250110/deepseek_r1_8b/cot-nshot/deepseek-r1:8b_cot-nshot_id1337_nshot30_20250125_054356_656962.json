    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested. For instance, an 18-year-old in example #27 had multiple factors but still ended up with a \"NO\" outcome. However, others like the 20-year-olds also had variable outcomes. So I think age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. In the examples, race and ethnicity didn't always directly correlate with recidivism, but it's often considered a demographic factor that can influence outcomes. Since Hispanic individuals might have different rates compared to others, I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nArrest history: She has been arrested once and convicted. From the data, having been arrested and convicted seems significant. Most examples showed higher arrest counts leading to rearrest likelihood. So this is likely high risk.\n\nWeight: 138 lbs. Body weight isn't directly mentioned as a factor in the examples, but being underweight could be associated with higher stress or other issues that might increase recidivism. Maybe low risk here.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Single individuals sometimes have different rates of criminal behavior compared to those in stable relationships. In some cases, single persons had outcomes like \"NO\" (e.g., example #27), but others with similar factors had \"YES\". So maybe medium risk.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. From examples, lacking education was a strong factor. The person in example #28 with 7 arrests and low education had a \"YES\" outcome, so this is likely high risk.\n\nEmployment status: She held 1 job. In the data, holding no jobs (like example #27) might be worse than having one. So having a job could reduce recidivism risk. Maybe low or medium.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down during the last month. Drug use is a strong factor for recidivism. The person in example #29 had drug use and felt down, but she had 17 arrests and ended up with \"NO\". It's mixed, so I'll rate this medium risk because sometimes it leads to rearrest, but not always.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: Lived in a household of size 4. Bigger families might offer more support or supervision, which could lower recidivism risk. So maybe low or medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God has nothing to do with her life. Beliefs can influence behavior. In example #30, someone who considered God's influence had a \"YES\" outcome. So this might be a high risk factor as it could mean she lacks a support system that might deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Age: 20 \u2192 Medium\n- Ethnicity: Hispanic \u2192 Medium\n- Arrest history: High\n- Body weight: Low\n- Marital status: Medium\n- Education: High\n- Employment: Low/Medium\n- Drug use: Medium\n- Household size: Low\n- Beliefs: High\n\nSo the highest risks are arrest history and education, both high. Then drug use and beliefs as medium. The rest are lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity can influence recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Conviction indicates higher likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Underweight might not directly affect recidivism but could relate to stress\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single status may correlate with higher recidivism in some cases\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education strongly links to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having a job reduces recidivism risk compared to none\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use increases recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Bigger households may provide more support, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"religion_beliefs\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious belief can increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
