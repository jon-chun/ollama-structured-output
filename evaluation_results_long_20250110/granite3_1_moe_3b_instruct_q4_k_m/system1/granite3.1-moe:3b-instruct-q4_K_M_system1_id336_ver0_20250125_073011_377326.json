    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe individual's age (19), race/ethnicity (Black), and living alone indicate a higher risk due to potential lack of social support structures and the vulnerability associated with being young. His arrest history, while not conviction, suggests a history of interaction with law enforcement which could be indicative of substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nThe individual's past use of marijuana in the last four years indicates potential drug involvement and dependency issues. However, this does not automatically equate to high risk; it's more about the context of regular use. \n\nHis employment history (2 jobs) suggests some level of stability but could also be a sign of impulsive behavior or lack of responsibility. His past marital status (never married), education level (high school diploma, not enrolled in college), and single living situation all point to potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe individual's religious belief ('God has something to do with what happens to me personally') may indicate a strong sense of morality or discipline, but it could also be indicative of coping mechanisms that might not always be healthy in terms of risk-taking behavior.\n\nLastly, while he considers himself depressed and hasn't felt this way over the past month, this is a positive sign indicating his awareness and ability to seek help if needed. Overall, these factors point towards high-risk potential due to lack of structured support systems, history of substance abuse, young age, and impulsive behavior.",
