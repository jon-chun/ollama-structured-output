    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 3 times and convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests are a strong indicator of future recidivism. For instance, in Example 29, someone with 17 arrests had a NO outcome, but that might be an outlier. In other cases like Example 5 (arrested 3 times), the outcome was YES, so high weight here.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been using marijuana and cocaine recently. Drug use can correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign a high weight here, similar to Examples 5, 28, etc., where drug use led to YES outcomes.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, which is a moderate risk. In Example 30, living alone didn't lead to rearrest, but other factors were strong. So maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with his mother in a small urban household as a child. Urban environments can have more crime, so this is a medium factor.\n\nNo jobs during the year suggests unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism. This should be high because having no income can push someone towards illegal activities.\n\nAge 18 is young, but he's already had arrests, so maybe low impact here since age might not be as significant once there's a history of crime.\n\nHe considers God uninvolved in his life. Spirituality can influence behavior; without it, he might lack certain coping mechanisms. This could be medium.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors (arrests, drug use, no job) and mediums (education, living alone, environment, spirituality). The positives are that he hasn't been depressed recently, but the negatives outweigh that. Based on examples where similar factors led to YES outcomes, I'd predict YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"3 prior arrests and convictions strongly correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Status\", \"medium\", \"Lacks diploma/GED and not enrolled in college, limiting opportunities and increasing risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong indicator of potential future illegal activity leading to arrest.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year indicates unemployment, which correlates with higher recidivism rates as lack of income may push towards criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone might limit support networks and increase vulnerability to criminal influences.\"),\n    (\"Residential History\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a small urban household could contribute to exposure to environmental risk factors for crime.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role in his life, potentially indicating lower self-control or community ties that might deter crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
