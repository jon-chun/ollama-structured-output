    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this 19-year-old male is likely to rearrest within three years. Let's go through each of his risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once but not convicted. In the examples given, a lot of people had multiple arrests and convictions, especially those who were more likely to recidivate. Since this person only has one arrest without a conviction, that might be a lower risk factor. I remember seeing cases where having no convictions could mean less severe charges or maybe it's just an arrest that didn't lead to anything, which is a bit better.\n\nHe identifies as White. Looking at the examples, race wasn't a predominant factor in determining recidivism. The outcomes varied regardless of race, so I think this one might be low impact.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. Body weight is something that sometimes relates to gang involvement or other factors, but in the examples provided, height and weight didn't seem to correlate directly with recidivism. So maybe this is a low factor here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. The examples showed mixed results for marital status. Some single individuals did rearrest, others didn't. Living alone could mean less support, but without more context on his living situation, I'd rate this as medium because it might indicate some level of isolation or lack of social support.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism rates. In the examples, people without education were more likely to rearrest. This seems like a strong indicator, so I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment can be tricky because even part-time or temporary jobs might count. But consistent employment is usually seen as protective against recidivism. Since he only had one job and maybe it was temporary, this could be a medium risk factor indicating possible instability.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant indicator of potential recidivism because drug crimes are common. In the examples, many who used drugs did rearrest, so I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive, but mental health issues can still be a factor even if not currently manifesting. Since he's not showing signs now, maybe this is low impact.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 5. Family environment can influence recidivism, especially if it's chaotic or has criminal elements. But without knowing the specifics, I'd rate this as medium because larger families might have more challenges but could also offer support.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs were present in some examples but didn't seem to directly correlate with recidivism outcomes. So this is likely a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors are education level and drug use, which are high risks. The arrest history and living situation contribute medium risks, while others like marital status and employment are lower. Considering that he has multiple moderate to high risk factors, especially around education and substance use, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. But since his only arrest didn't lead to conviction and he's employed (even minimally), maybe the confidence isn't too high but still leans towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only arrested once, no conviction\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation in examples\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status/Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate isolation\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Minimal job history suggests instability\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression currently\"),\n    (\"Family environment\", \"medium\", \"Large household could have challenges\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
