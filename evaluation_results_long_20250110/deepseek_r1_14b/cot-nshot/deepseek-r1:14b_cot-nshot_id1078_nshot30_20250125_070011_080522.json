    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to predict whether a 20-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. First, I'll list out all the provided information:\n\n- **Age**: 20 (young adult)\n- **Race**: Black\n- **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested 10 times, convicted\n- **Height/Weight**: 5'11\", 180 lbs (average build)\n- **Marital Status**: Never married, currently not living alone\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n- **Employment**: No jobs held during the year\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years\n- **Mental Health**: Not felt depressed in the past month\n- **Living Situation**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area as a child\n- **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Considers God has nothing to do with what happens\n\nNow, I'll compare each factor to the examples given.\n\n1. **Arrest and Conviction History (High Weight)**: In the examples, higher arrest counts (like 7, 10, 17) often led to a \"YES.\" For instance, Example #28 had 7 arrests and was a \"YES,\" while Example #3 had 1 arrest but was a \"NO.\" Since this individual has 10 arrests and is convicted, it's a strong indicator.\n\n2. **Employment Status (High Weight)**: In Examples like #14, not holding a job led to \"NO.\" However, in others with no jobs, outcomes varied. Here, since there are no jobs, it's negative but not the strongest factor alone.\n\n3. **Education Level (High Weight)**: No diploma or GED correlates with higher recidivism. Examples #1 and #27 without education were \"NO\" and \"NO.\" This is a significant factor.\n\n4. **Living Situation as Child**: Lived with mother in an urban area of size 3. In the examples, living with both parents (Examples #6, #26) sometimes led to \"NO,\" while others didn't focus on this. Maybe low impact here.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana, which is common but still a factor. Examples like #14 and #27 used drugs and were \"NO\" or \"NO.\" Not as strong as other factors.\n\n6. **Spirituality**: Believes God has no role. In examples, this wasn't a primary focus, so probably low impact.\n\n7. **Age**: 20 is young but not necessarily a high risk factor on its own, though it's an adult age where recidivism might be more established.\n\n8. **Race**: While race can be a factor, in the examples, outcomes varied regardless of race. So perhaps lower weight here unless combined with others.\n\n9. **Height/Weight**: Average build, likely low impact.\n\n10. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed recently is positive but may not significantly influence recidivism if other factors are strong.\n\nConsidering all these, the strongest factors are arrest history and education level. Arrest count being high (10) suggests a pattern, while lack of education and employment are concerning. Drug use adds another layer but isn't as impactful alone.\n\nLooking at examples with similar factors: Example #3 had 1 arrest, no job, no diploma, and was \"NO.\" Example #28 had 7 arrests, no job, and was \"YES.\" This case has more severe factors than #3 but less than #28. However, the high number of arrests (10) might push it towards \"YES.\"\n\nI'm about 65% confident because while the arrest count is high, other mitigating factors like not feeling depressed and possibly some community support could influence outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and conviction history significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year indicates potential instability\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in past four years is a moderate factor\"),\n    (\"Living Situation as Child\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with mother may have some impact but less than other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
