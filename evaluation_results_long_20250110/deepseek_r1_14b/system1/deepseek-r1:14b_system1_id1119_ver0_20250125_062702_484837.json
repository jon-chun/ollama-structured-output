    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal justice issues. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old Black male. Age is often a significant factor because younger individuals are generally at higher risk due to being in their prime years for criminal activity. However, race alone isn't a determinant of risk; it's more about how societal factors might influence opportunities or systemic issues. But I have to consider that sometimes these factors can contribute to statistical data.\n\nHe has been arrested six times without any convictions. Arrests without convictions could indicate a few things\u2014maybe he was involved in minor offenses, or perhaps there were legal loopholes. However, multiple arrests regardless of conviction history can still be a red flag because they suggest ongoing involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I might not give much weight to that unless it's related to physical altercations or specific types of crimes where size matters.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Lack of strong social ties can sometimes be a risk factor because there\u2019s less support systems in place. Living alone might mean he has more freedom to engage in risky behavior without immediate consequences, but this isn't a direct indicator on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked with higher crime rates because education can be a protective factor against delinquency. Without a diploma, it might limit his employment opportunities, pushing him towards alternative means of income that could be illegal.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially when combined with other risk factors. Financial stress and lack of legitimate income can push someone towards crime as a way to survive or support himself.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and he's been feeling down in the dumps all month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to legal issues, and contribute to criminal behavior. Chronic drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates. His recent feelings of depression might indicate underlying mental health issues, which can also be a contributing factor to risky behavior.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four siblings or family members. While larger families can sometimes mean more support, it could also indicate a lack of individual attention or potential exposure to negative influences early on. This is a moderate risk factor but not the strongest.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal happenings. Spiritual beliefs can be both protective and potentially isolating depending on how they're applied. In some cases, strong religious beliefs might deter someone from criminal behavior due to moral guidelines, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests without convictions suggest some level of involvement; lack of education and employment point towards limited opportunities; drug use and recent depression are strong indicators of potential instability or risky decisions. The combination of several moderate risk factors (age, race, unemployment, education) with more significant ones like substance abuse and ongoing legal involvement could suggest a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, since he hasn't been convicted yet, it's possible that these arrests didn't result in charges, which might indicate good legal representation or non-serious offenses. But given the other factors\u2014unemployment, education, drug use\u2014the overall risk seems elevated but not extremely high.\n\nI would rate this as a moderate to high risk. Maybe around 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
