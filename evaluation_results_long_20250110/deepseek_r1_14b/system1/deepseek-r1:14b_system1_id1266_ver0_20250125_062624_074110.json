    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this individual presents a high risk based on the provided factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female, which is relatively young but still an adult. Her Hispanic identity might be relevant in some contexts, but without specific cultural or legal factors related to that, I'll note it as neutral unless other aspects tie into it.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential future issues, especially if they're recent or frequent. Two arrests might suggest a pattern, but the lack of convictions could mean she hasn't had significant legal trouble yet.\n\nHer physical stats don't seem to add risk factors on their own. Being 5'2\" and weighing in that range is typical and doesn't correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might reduce some risks, like domestic issues, but being unmarried at 19 isn't a direct indicator of risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college could be a red flag. Lower educational attainment is often linked to higher risk factors because it can limit employment opportunities and increase stress. However, she has held one job during the year, which shows some stability but might be temporary.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism. The fact that she's used these drugs recently indicates ongoing issues.\n\nShe experienced depression symptoms in the past month, feeling so down nothing cheered her up. Mental health issues can contribute to risk factors by affecting decision-making and increasing stress levels, which might lead to impulsive actions.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of six could indicate community dynamics but doesn't directly point to high risk unless there are other family issues, which aren't mentioned here. However, living in an urban area might expose her to more crime and negative influences.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal events suggests she's spiritual or religious. This can sometimes be a protective factor, as religion is often associated with lower criminal behavior due to stronger community ties and moral guidelines.\n\nPutting this all together: The significant factors are two arrests without convictions, substance abuse in the past year, lack of education, unemployment status (only one job), and recent depression symptoms. These points lean towards higher risk because drug use and mental health issues are strong predictors. However, her living alone, being employed, and spiritual beliefs might mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high-risk assessment but with moderate confidence because while several factors point to risk, others provide some stability. Without more severe criminal history or additional negative indicators, the confidence isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
