    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. So, I'm supposed to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk and provide a JSON response with \"YES\" or \"NO\" for prediction and a confidence level between 0-100.\n\nFirst, looking at the age: she's 19. That's young, but not necessarily an indicator of high risk on its own. Many young people have brushes with the law without going on to commit serious crimes.\n\nNext, she identifies as Hispanic. I know that ethnicity can sometimes correlate with certain statistics, but it's a sensitive area and I should be cautious here. It shouldn't be a direct factor unless there are specific cultural or socioeconomic factors at play.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests don't always lead to convictions, so this might not be a strong indicator. However, it does suggest some level of legal involvement, which could be a red flag.\n\nHeight is 5'6\". I'm not sure how relevant physical height is in risk assessment. It doesn't seem directly related to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't uncommon, especially if she's independent or comes from a family situation that required her to live separately. Being unmarried likely has no direct bearing on risk factors here.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This might indicate limited educational prospects, which could correlate with higher risk factors like unemployment or economic stressors. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. Having consistent employment is generally a positive factor that can reduce recidivism by providing stability and income. So this might actually be a protective factor rather than a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and some days she's felt down in the dumps. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, particularly if it's recent and ongoing. The fact that she's using both marijuana and cocaine could be concerning. Additionally, feeling depressed recently might indicate mental health issues, which can also contribute to higher risk.\n\nFamily background: She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Growing up in a large family in an urban setting can present challenges, but it's not inherently risky unless there are other factors like family dysfunction or exposure to crime. Without more details, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Having strong religious beliefs can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior as it may provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance. So this might actually lower the risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together:\n\n- Positive indicators: Employment history, religious beliefs.\n- Negative indicators: Drug use, arrest record, possible socioeconomic challenges from urban upbringing.\n\nThe key here is the recent drug use, especially cocaine, which is more associated with higher criminal behavior and recidivism. Her arrest without conviction might not be a strong indicator alone, but combined with drug issues, it could raise concern. The fact that she's young and has other positive factors like employment and religious beliefs might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nI would say there's a moderate risk. Maybe around 60-70% confidence? But I need to balance the factors carefully. Drug use is significant but her employment and possible support systems (like religion) could help reduce that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
