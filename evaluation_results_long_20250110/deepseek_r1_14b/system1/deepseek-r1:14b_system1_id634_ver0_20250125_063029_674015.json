    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, Hispanic. Age is in his early twenties, which can sometimes be a higher risk period due to possible impulsive behavior, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Criminal history, even if just a single conviction, can be a red flag. However, the fact that it's only one arrest might temper that risk somewhat.\n\nHispanic ethnicity\u2014while some studies suggest certain groups may have higher recidivism rates, it's important not to stereotype and consider other factors more concretely linked to risk.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 180 lbs. Physical stats alone don't indicate risk; they might come into play in different contexts but aren't direct indicators here.\n\nMarried and living with his spouse\u2014marriage is generally associated with lower recidivism rates as it provides stability and support, which could mitigate some risk factors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED can indicate challenges in formal education, which might be correlated with other risk factors like unemployment or lack of opportunities, but without further context on his educational background, it's hard to assess the weight here.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year\u2014employment is typically protective against criminal behavior as it provides income and structure. Having two jobs suggests he's responsible and perhaps more tied into a routine that reduces delinquency.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use, especially recent usage, can be a significant factor. Marijuana, while less severe than other substances, can still impair judgment and may correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nNo reported depression in the past month\u2014mental health is crucial. The absence of current depressive symptoms might reduce risk, but if there's underlying mental health issues not mentioned, that could be a concern.\n\nHe lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 2. This indicates he may have had unstable living arrangements early on, which can contribute to higher risk factors as it relates to lack of consistent support systems and possible exposure to negative influences.\n\nConsiders that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\u2014this might indicate a lack of strong spiritual or moral framework, which could influence decision-making and behavior. However, personal spirituality varies widely and isn't a direct indicator without more context.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some protective factors like marriage, employment, no current depression. But there are risk factors such as prior conviction, recent drug use, and early unstable living arrangements. The fact that he's Hispanic could be considered in the context of statistical data on recidivism rates for certain groups, but it should not be the sole factor.\n\nThe presence of a criminal history, even if just once, coupled with recent drug use and potential influences from past living situations might suggest a higher risk, but it's balanced by his current stable living situation and employment. The confidence level isn't extremely high, perhaps around 65%, as there are both mitigating and concerning factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
