    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female, White. Age is quite young but not necessarily an indicator of high risk unless other factors come into play. Her race might be relevant in some contexts, but I don't see immediate red flags there.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, especially if the convictions are for serious offenses. However, without knowing the specifics of the charges, it's hard to gauge severity. Still, a conviction does suggest some level of legal trouble which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe stands at 5'7\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Body weight alone doesn't indicate risk unless there are health issues related to it, but that's not provided here. So probably not relevant for criminal risk assessment.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a factor if she struggles with isolation or lacks social networks. But being unmarried isn't inherently risky.\n\nShe has an associate degree and isn't enrolled in college now. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, but her having completed some education doesn't necessarily negate other risk factors. She's held three jobs in the year, which shows she's employed but job hopping might indicate instability or issues maintaining consistent employment.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. Recent use (past month) of feeling down indicates possible depression or substance abuse, which could be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of five might suggest challenges during upbringing, possibly exposure to negative influences or environments conducive to crime. However, without more details on family dynamics or environment, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can be both protective and potentially lead to radicalization, though that's less common. It might affect her decision-making but isn't a direct indicator of risk.\n\nPutting this all together: she has criminal history, recent drug use, possible mental health issues (feeling down), living alone, and came from an urban household. These factors could contribute to higher risk, especially considering the arrest/conviction history and ongoing drug use which are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

She has completed study at an associate/junior college and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
