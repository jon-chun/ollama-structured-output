While race isn't a direct indicator, it can relate to systemic issues.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited education, which is linked to lower employability and higher crime rates.\n\nLiving alone might mean less social support, increasing risk factors.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held 2 jobs during the year. While some employment is positive, it's inconsistent and may indicate instability.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in recent years is a significant red flag for criminal behavior.\n\nHe experienced persistent sadness recently, which could relate to mental health issues. Mental health struggles can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with 6 siblings might have exposed him to higher crime rates or negative influences.\n\nBelieving that God has control over his life might indicate strong beliefs but doesn't directly contribute to risk assessment.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple arrests, drug use, lack of education, mental health issues, and unstable living situation points towards a high-risk individual. However, factors like employment history slightly mitigate but don't eliminate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
