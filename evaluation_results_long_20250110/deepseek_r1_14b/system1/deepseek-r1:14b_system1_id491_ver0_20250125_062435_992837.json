    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male. Age can sometimes be a factor because younger individuals might have less stability. He identifies as White; race isn't typically a direct indicator but can influence societal factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean that the charges were dropped or he was acquitted, which is positive, but it still shows some risk-taking behavior.\n\nHe stands at 5'9\" and weighs 145 lbs. Height and weight alone don't usually indicate risk unless there's an underlying issue like obesity, which isn't the case here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living with others might mean he has support systems in place, which could be protective factors against high risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment can correlate with future stability; without education, there are fewer opportunities, potentially leading to higher risks like unemployment or criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having a job is good, but only one might indicate limited work history or instability in employment, which could be a risk factor if he loses that job.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so this absence is positive. Lack of depression is also favorable.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4 in a rural area. Growing up in a rural setting might mean less access to certain resources or higher crime rates depending on the area. Having lived with both parents could be protective, but it's unclear without more info.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by offering coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some negative indicators like arrest, lack of education, single job, and living arrangement. Positive factors include no drug use, not depressed, and religious beliefs. The mix suggests moderate risk but leans towards lower since the positive aspects might mitigate some negatives.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
