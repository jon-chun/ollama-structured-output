    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have less stability but are also developing. Being female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that's somewhat protective.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race directly impacts risk here, but it's noted for completeness.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk indicator, even without a conviction, because they might show a tendency towards problematic behavior. However, no conviction could mean the case was dismissed or she wasn't found guilty.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 175-199 lbs. I don't see how height and weight directly relate to criminal risk unless it's related to specific types of crime, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a slight risk factor if she lacks social connections. However, being 18, this is common and not necessarily a strong indicator.\n\nEnrolled in school: Education can be protective against reoffending, as it provides structure and opportunities.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year: Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so that's positive.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. Cocaine is particularly concerning as it can lead to more impulsive actions.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month: Mental health is important; not feeling depressed might reduce some risks, but without knowing other mental health factors, it's hard to assess fully.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 4: Family dynamics can influence behavior. Living with a parent might provide stability, but if there are issues within the family, that could be a risk. However, without more info, this is neutral.\n\nConsiders God has nothing to do with her personal outcomes: This seems like a personal belief and not directly linked to criminal risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history, recent drug use, living alone, and being young are moderate risk factors. Positive aspects include school enrollment and employment. I'm leaning towards high risk but with some protective factors present.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
