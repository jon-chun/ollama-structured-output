    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment case for a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested seven times but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can be a red flag because they often indicate involvement in criminal activities, even if there's no conviction. The fact that there are multiple arrests is concerning\u2014it shows a pattern rather than an isolated incident.\n\nHe\u2019s young, 21, which is still considered early adulthood. Younger individuals might have less impulse control and higher risk-taking behaviors. His Hispanic identity could be relevant depending on the context of his arrests, but without specific info on bias, I'll focus on other factors.\n\nLiving situation-wise, he's not living alone, which might mean he has some support system, but it could also indicate that he's in a environment that doesn't encourage positive change. He lived with his biological mother in a household of four when he was young\u2014this could point to potential family dynamics or influences that might have contributed to his behavior.\n\nHe\u2019s 6'2\" and weighs 215 lbs., which is within the average BMI range, so no immediate health red flags there.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. This shows some level of commitment to education, which could be a positive indicator. However, being in a two-year program might suggest he hasn't pursued higher education further, but that's not necessarily a negative unless it impacts his current situation.\n\nEmployment history: He's held one job during the year. Steady employment can be a good sign, showing responsibility and structure in his life. However, having only one job might mean limited income or perhaps challenges in maintaining multiple roles.\n\nSubstance use: He has used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana use isn't typically associated with high violent crime rates, it can still contribute to risk factors like impaired judgment or potential legal issues, especially if he's arrested for drug-related offenses.\n\nMental health: He hasn\u2019t felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. However, mental health can fluctuate, and without knowing his history beyond the last month, there might be underlying issues not captured here.\n\nSpirituality: He believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. While this could indicate resilience or coping mechanisms, it's also possible that such beliefs might influence his actions in ways that aren't entirely predictable.\n\nPutting this all together, the key factors are multiple arrests without convictions, which is a significant indicator of potential future risk. His age and employment status show some stability but don't outweigh the arrest history. The lack of depression is a plus, but other aspects like drug use and living situation could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"YES\" for high risk because multiple arrests are often indicative of ongoing issues, even without convictions. However, his educational enrollment and employment might slightly lower the confidence level compared to someone with a worse profile. So I'd estimate around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
