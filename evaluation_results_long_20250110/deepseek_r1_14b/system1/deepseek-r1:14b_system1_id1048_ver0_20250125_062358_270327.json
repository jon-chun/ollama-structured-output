    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male, which is relevant because demographic factors can sometimes correlate with certain risks, though it's important not to stereotype.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That\u2019s a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually point towards higher criminal tendencies or potential for recidivism. So that definitely contributes to high risk.\n\nLooking at his living situation: he's currently living alone and hasn't been married. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor if he's not handling things well on his own. No prior marriages don't necessarily add risk but combined with other factors, it could be relevant.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now but hasn\u2019t held any jobs during the year. Lack of steady employment can indicate economic instability or difficulty in maintaining responsibilities, which might correlate with higher risk behaviors. However, being in school is a positive indicator, so that somewhat mitigates the lack of work history.\n\nSubstance use: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is concerning because it can impair judgment, contribute to criminal behavior, and indicate ongoing issues that might lead to further problems.\n\nMental health-wise, he's felt down in the dumps recently, even during the past month. Persistent sadness could be a sign of underlying depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors as they can affect decision-making and stability.\n\nFamily background: He lived with his biological mother in an urban area household of size 4. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics also play a role. Without more details on the family environment, it's hard to assess, but living in such conditions could contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This might indicate a lack of strong social or religious support systems, which can be protective factors against criminal behavior and other risks.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests/convictions, recent drug use, mental health issues, living alone without job history, and potential socioeconomic factors from an urban background. These are all significant risk indicators for possible future offenses or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
