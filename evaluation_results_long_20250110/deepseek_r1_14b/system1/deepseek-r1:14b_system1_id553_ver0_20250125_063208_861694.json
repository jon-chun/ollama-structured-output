Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age might be a factor since younger individuals could have less stability, but being Black isn't inherently a risk indicator. Next, she has been arrested once and convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, especially if it's a conviction.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and weighs 110 lbs. I don't see how height and weight contribute to risk assessment here, so maybe not relevant.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor. No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests possible educational instability, which can correlate with higher risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year, indicating some stability but perhaps limited income. No drug use in four years is positive, but she's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues\u2014a known risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 6 when young might suggest a chaotic background, possibly contributing to higher risk. She considers God influential in her life, which can be protective or indicative of coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: One arrest/conviction, unstable living situation, limited education, recent depression symptoms, and a large household upbringing. These could point towards high risk. However, no ongoing drug use might slightly lower the confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
