    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case. The individual is a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That arrest could be a red flag, as prior arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future offenses, even without a conviction.\n\nHe has a history of drug use\u2014specifically marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is often linked to higher risk of reoffending or engaging in criminal behavior. However, he hasn't reported feeling depressed recently, which might suggest that mental health isn't currently a significant factor.\n\nLiving alone and not being married could mean less social support, potentially increasing risk factors. His background includes living in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of seven. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and growing up in a large family might indicate exposure to certain influences or challenges.\n\nHe holds two jobs, which shows responsibility but also that he's working multiple roles, maybe under financial pressure. Having a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college suggests education isn't his current focus, though that doesn't necessarily correlate with risk.\n\nHis religious beliefs\u2014or lack thereof\u2014might influence behavior. He believes God has nothing to do with his personal circumstances, which could affect his coping mechanisms or decision-making processes.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the arrest and drug use are significant. The other aspects like employment and living situation don't strongly indicate high risk but aren't entirely neutral either. There's a moderate likelihood he might pose a risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
