    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the provided factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22, which is relatively young but not too young. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but that varies widely.\n\nEthnicity: Hispanic. I'm not sure if this directly impacts risk assessment unless there are systemic factors at play, but I should consider it in context.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, but a conviction does indicate some level of past criminality.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 210 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant physical stats are here unless there's an association with certain crimes or risk factors.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. No spouse might mean fewer social supports, but he's living alone which could be a neutral factor.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, as education is linked to opportunities and stability.\n\nEmployment history: Held two jobs during the year. Having recent employment is generally a positive sign, indicating some level of responsibility.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use in past four years. While marijuana isn't typically associated with high violent crime rates, any drug use could indicate potential for substance-related offenses or impaired judgment.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. No current mental health issues reported, which is positive.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more social challenges, but not everyone from such backgrounds is high risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective, but it's context-dependent.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a conviction, which is a significant red flag. His education level and lack of college enrollment might contribute to lower social mobility. Urban upbringing could mean exposure to more negative influences. However, he's employed, hasn't shown signs of depression, and while he uses marijuana, it's not a high-risk drug in this context.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium risk because the conviction is concerning, but other factors don't strongly indicate a high-risk individual. Maybe 60% confidence? I think that's a reasonable middle ground.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
