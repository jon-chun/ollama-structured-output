    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point systematically.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not necessarily indicative of higher risk unless there are other factors. Gender-wise, females generally have lower recidivism rates than males, so that might mitigate some risk.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race, but ethnicity alone doesn't typically predict criminal behavior. Her arrest history shows she's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This could mean a couple of things: either the charges were dismissed or she didn't proceed to trial. The absence of a conviction is positive, but an arrest itself can still be a red flag.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Generally, being in a stable relationship might reduce risk factors, though it's not a definitive indicator. Her height and weight don't contribute much to risk assessment unless there are other health-related issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher risk of criminal behavior because limited education often leads to fewer job opportunities. She hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could mean unemployment is an issue. Unemployment is another factor linked to increased criminal activity as financial stress might push someone toward illegal means.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. However, she admits to feeling down in the dumps some days recently, indicating possible mental health issues or stress. Mental health struggles can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors if not managed properly.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 4 isn't inherently risky unless there were other factors like family dysfunction, which aren't specified here. Lastly, she feels that God has nothing to do with her personal outcomes, which might indicate a lack of strong social or religious support systems, potentially increasing risk if those are protective factors.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some negative indicators like arrest, unemployment, and low education, but also positive ones like no drug use, being married, and stable living situation. The mental health aspect adds complexity. Given the balance, I'm leaning toward a moderate risk rather than high. So, prediction would be \"NO\" for high risk with maybe 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
