    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's young, which might make her more impulsive but also has higher potential for change. Her gender is female\u2014women generally have lower recidivism rates than men, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe's Hispanic. I know that race and ethnicity can be factors, but it's important to consider systemic issues rather than individual traits. So maybe this should be low unless other factors compound it.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. Unconvicted might mean the charge was dismissed or she didn't plead guilty, which could indicate less severity. However, an arrest itself is a risk factor, so I'll note that as medium.\n\nLiving alone at 20 without being married could mean she has more independence but might lack support networks. This might be low unless other factors suggest instability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so this should be low. She's employed in three jobs, which shows responsibility and ability to hold down work\u2014another positive sign (low risk).\n\nNo drug use in four years is great; substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism. No depression recently also helps, as mental health issues can contribute to reoffending. Both of these are low risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is protective, but urban areas might have more crime exposure. I'll consider this medium because while family support is good, the environment could still be a risk.\n\nLastly, she feels God has nothing to do with her life. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some, so the absence of it might mean less internal coping mechanisms\u2014this could be low but maybe leaning towards medium if religion plays a role in others' lives.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low except for the arrest and perhaps her background. Since she's young, hasn't used drugs, is employed, and educated, I'd predict she won't recidivate. My confidence is around 75% because while some factors are positive, the arrest could still be a concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old; young age may indicate higher risk due to immaturity but also potential for change\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"female gender generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may be a factor in some contexts, though it is important to consider systemic issues rather than individual traits\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"one arrest without conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"never married and living alone at 20 years old may suggest independence but could also indicate lack of support networks\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"has a high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college; education is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"held three jobs during the year; steady employment is a positive factor associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years; substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not felt depressed over the past month; mental health issues can be a risk factor but current status is stable\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"grew up with both biological parents in an urban area; family stability may provide some protection, but urban environment could have higher exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"considers God has nothing to do with her personally; lack of religious involvement may or may not be a risk factor depending on individual circumstances\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
