    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be impulsive or not have stable life circumstances yet. So that's probably high.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think race alone should influence the assessment unless there are systemic factors. But maybe in some contexts, it could play a role? Hmm, not sure about that one. Maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested once without conviction. An arrest can still be a red flag because it shows potential for law involvement. So medium here.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'2\" and 170 lbs. Physical size might influence confrontations or perceptions by others, but not directly linked to recidivism. Probably low impact.\n\nNever married and living with others. Not being alone could mean more supervision and support, which is a protective factor. So that's low risk.\n\nGED and not in college. GED can be a barrier but he has some education. No college enrollment might indicate less focus on future goals. Maybe medium here since education ties to recidivism rates.\n\nTwo jobs in the past year. Having steady employment is usually a good sign, as it provides income and structure. So that's low risk.\n\nDrug use in past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major factor linked to crime. That should be high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but absence here is positive. Low impact.\n\nGrowing up with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so that's a medium factor. Also, family dynamics could influence behavior.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Spiritual factors sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if someone feels supported by a higher power, but lack of belief isn't directly linked. So maybe low impact.\n\nNow, considering all these, the strongest factors are drug use and age. Employment is positive, living with others is protective. The arrest and urban background add some risk, but not as significant. \n\nSo overall, I think he's at a moderate risk. Maybe confidence around 60% because of mixed factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are often more likely to engage in risky behavior and have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor for recidivism, but systemic issues may play a role\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction can still be a red flag indicating potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not being married and living with others may indicate some level of social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not currently enrolled in college could indicate limited educational focus\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine and marijuana, is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a biological mother may contribute to environmental risk factors\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's influence on personal life does not directly correlate with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
