    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male. Young age can sometimes be a risk factor because younger individuals might have less stability and more\u51b2\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002 But at 21, it's not extremely high, but still something to consider.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how significant that is here without more context about his experiences with the justice system.\n\nArrested once and convicted once. A single conviction might be a moderate risk factor because it shows he has a history of\u8fdd\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cbut one instance isn't as concerning as multiple offenses.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'3\" and 175-199 lbs. Physical size can sometimes relate to crime statistics, but I'm not sure how much that plays into individual risk assessment without specific data linking height/weight to recidivism.\n\nNever married, living alone. Being unmarried might mean fewer social ties, which could be a slight risk factor. Living alone might also reduce support networks, potentially increasing the chance of rearrest.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education can be protective against recidivism. Having a diploma is better than nothing but not as strong as higher education. Not being enrolled might mean he's not currently seeking further education, which could be a slight negative factor.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment is generally a good sign because it provides structure and income. Two jobs suggest stability and responsibility, which likely reduces recidivism risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression in the past month. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so his clean record here is positive. No recent depression also suggests he's not struggling with mental health issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of five as a child. Family stability can be protective. Having grown up in a home with two parents might lower recidivism risk, especially if the environment was stable.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and deter from criminal behavior, which is a positive factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: He's young but employed and educated. No recent substance abuse or mental health issues. Positive family background and spiritual beliefs are protective. The only negatives are being unmarried and living alone, along with a prior conviction.\n\nI think the risk factors would be moderate for most elements, with some low and one high (the prior arrest/conviction). His stable employment, education, no drug use, and supportive background likely mitigate the risks. So overall, the prediction would be \"NO\" for rearrest, with maybe 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of stability\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race can be a factor, but individual circumstances matter more\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate past criminal behavior, a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism on their own\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried; marital ties can reduce recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and not enrolled in college; education is protective but less so than higher education\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employed in two jobs; stable employment reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years; substance abuse is a major risk factor, absence here is positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month; mental health issues can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable household; strong family ties are protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Believes God influences events; spirituality may reduce recidivism but is context-dependent\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
