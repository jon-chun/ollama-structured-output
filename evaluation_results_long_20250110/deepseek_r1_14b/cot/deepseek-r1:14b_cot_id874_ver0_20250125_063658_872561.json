    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but at 21, he's on the lower end of that spectrum. His race might not directly impact risk, so I'd consider this a low factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction is a moderate risk since it indicates past criminal behavior but isn't a long history. \n\nHeight and weight\u20146'0\" and 240 lbs. These stats are more about physical presence; they might influence interactions but aren't direct predictors of recidivism, so low.\n\nNever been married and not living alone. Being unmarried isn't necessarily a risk factor, but not living alone could mean he's relying on others for support, which is somewhat neutral to low in risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong low or even medium factor because higher education can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHeld three jobs during the year. Steady employment is positive; it suggests he's managing his life well, so that's a low to medium protective factor.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use can be linked to criminal behavior, especially if it leads to substance-related crimes or repeat offenses, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression reported recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, that's low protective.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing can be protective, so this is low.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life events. Spirituality or lack thereof might influence behavior, but I'm not sure how significant this factor is; probably low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the main high risk is drug use. The positive factors like education and employment are strong but need to be balanced against past arrest and conviction. It's a bit of a mix, so my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%. I'd lean towards predicting he might rearrest, but not strongly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White identification is not a direct risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest and conviction history indicates past criminal behavior but not extensive history\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size does not directly correlate with recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married status is neutral to risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may indicate some support system, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Steady employment suggests responsibility and reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use can be linked to higher recidivism due to potential legal issues or substance-related crimes\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable household is protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in divine influence on personal events is neutral to risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
