    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's recidivism over the next three years. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old White male. Age is a factor because younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates, but since he's in his early twenties, that might be moderate. His race isn't directly a risk factor, so I'll note it but not assign weight here.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and convicted. Arrests are definitely a red flag. Multiple arrests usually indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a high risk factor for recidivism.\n\nCurrently, he weighs 190 lbs at 6 feet 4 inches. His physical size isn't directly a risk factor unless it's related to past crimes, but there's no info suggesting that, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nHe hasn't been married and isn't living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor if he has more independence, but not living alone might mean he's in a supportive environment or maybe not. Without more context, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism because it provides opportunities and reduces\u95f2\u6687\u65f6\u95f4. So this should be a medium positive factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a strong protective factor as steady work reduces the likelihood of criminal activity. However, since he only had one job, maybe part-time or temporary, I'll consider it low to medium.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has experienced depressed mood recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior. His recent depression could also increase impulsivity, so this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and three others. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family environment matters too. If the household was supportive, it's protective; if not, it's risky. Since he's had multiple arrests, maybe the environment wasn't great. I'll assign medium here.\n\nHe considers God irrelevant to his life events. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior, so lack of spirituality might make him more susceptible to negative influences. This is a low to medium risk factor.\n\nNow, putting all these together: high factors are prior convictions and drug use/depression. Medium factors include age, education, and possibly the upbringing. Low factors are living situation, employment, size, and spirituality.\n\nSince two high factors and several mediums, but especially with multiple convictions and ongoing issues like drugs and mood, I think he's at a higher risk. So prediction is YES for recidivism, confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"enrolled in a 2-year college, which is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"held one job during the year; some stability but limited\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana use increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"recent depression symptoms increase impulsivity and risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"not living alone, which may or may not be protective\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"height and weight not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"lack of belief in God might correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"grown up in an urban area which can have higher crime rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
