    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the age is 22. That's relatively young, but not too young in terms of criminal history. However, being younger might mean there's more room for change, which could be a protective factor, so I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nNext, he identifies himself as Black. While race can be a factor due to systemic issues and biases, it's important to consider context without stereotyping. This should be handled carefully, but in terms of statistical models, sometimes demographic factors like race are included. However, given the other factors, I might rate this as low unless there's specific data indicating higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate that charges were dropped or acquitted, which is positive. However, arrests can still be a red flag. The risk here would probably be medium because while he hasn't been convicted, the arrests are concerning.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 188 lbs) don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless they're factors in gang activity or physical altercations. Without more context, I'd consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might reduce support networks but isn't inherently risky. No spouse could mean less pressure but also no positive influence. This is probably medium because living alone can be a risk factor for recidivism as he lacks social support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. This seems like a strong indicator, so I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the year. Unemployment is a significant predictor of rearrest. Without income, he might turn to illegal activities, making this high risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use can be a factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. However, compared to harder drugs, it might have a lower impact. I'd rate this as medium.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no depression is positive. This would be low risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological dad in a household of two. Family structure can influence behavior, but without more details on the family environment, it's hard to assess. Maybe low or medium, but I'll lean towards low since he had a parent figure.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Faith can be protective and reduce recidivism. This should be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several factors like education, employment, and drug use are high/medium risks. Protective factors include age and faith. The overall risk seems moderate but leaning towards higher due to the structural issues like education and joblessness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young, which may indicate potential for change\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Black individuals can face systemic issues, but no specific indication of gang affiliation or crime history\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest possible legal involvement without proven guilt\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior based on physical stats alone\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate lack of support networks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No job history in the year increases risk due to potential financial strain\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can be a factor but less severe than harder drugs\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, which is positive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with biological dad in a small household\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
