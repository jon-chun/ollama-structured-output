    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to tackle this risk assessment step by step. Let's break down each factor provided.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age can be significant because younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates due to immaturity or lack of stability. However, since he's only 20 and has limited criminal history, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate a low-level offense or good legal representation. This could be a mitigating factor, so I'll assign it low weight.\n\nHeight and weight are both within average ranges, which don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, these factors can be disregarded.\n\nHe's never been married. Marital status isn't a direct indicator of recidivism but can sometimes influence stability. I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nLiving situation: he's not living alone, which might mean he has some support system in place. This could reduce the risk, so another low factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While education is a protective factor, having just a diploma without current enrollment might not be as strong as higher education. Medium seems appropriate here.\n\nEmployment history: he's held one job during the year. Steady employment is a positive sign linked to lower recidivism. This should be low risk.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used in four years and no depression symptoms recently. Abstinence from drugs for an extended period is a strong protective factor, so I'll note this as high.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Large households can sometimes mean higher exposure to negative influences but also support. This might be medium risk.\n\nLastly, he believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs are often associated with lower recidivism rates as they can provide motivation for positive behavior. High weight here seems fitting.\n\nConsidering all these factors, most lean towards low or medium risks except drug abstinence and spiritual beliefs which are high. However, the lack of a conviction and stable employment are strong positives. The age is still a bit concerning but not overly so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity itself is not a direct indicator of risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest, no conviction, which suggests low severity offense\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight; no direct correlation with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married may indicate less stability but not necessarily higher risk\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone could imply some form of support system\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, which is a basic level of education; more protective than no diploma\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Currently employed, which is a positive factor associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in four years, indicating strong self-control and reduced risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests current mental stability\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a large household in an urban area; could have exposure to negative influences but also support\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"high\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which is associated with lower recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
