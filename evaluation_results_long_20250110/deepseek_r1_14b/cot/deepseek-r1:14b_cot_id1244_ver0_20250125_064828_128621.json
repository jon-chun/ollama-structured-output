    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 21-year-old Black male. Age is usually a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability. But being 21 isn't super young; it's on the lower end but not extremely so. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but I need to consider other factors too.\n\nHe's been arrested once without a conviction. That arrest is a red flag because even if there was no conviction, an arrest can indicate potential law involvement. But since he wasn't convicted, maybe it was a false charge or minor offense that didn't lead to a conviction. Still, arrests are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nLiving alone at 21 might mean he's independent but could also lack support networks. Some studies suggest living with others can reduce recidivism by providing oversight and support. So living alone might be a slight risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which is neutral to slightly positive. Employment-wise, he's had two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is usually protective against recidivism because it provides income and structure. However, having multiple jobs could indicate instability if they're short-term or part-time.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and isn't depressed recently. These are positive factors as mental health issues and substance abuse often increase recidivism risk. His current state seems stable on these fronts.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and a household of five might indicate some challenges. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and living in a larger family could mean more supervision but also potential for exposure to negative influences. The exact impact here is mixed, so I'd consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, as they might provide motivation and support systems. This is likely a low-risk factor because it's generally associated with positive outcomes.\n\nPutting all these together: arrest history (medium), age (low to medium), race (some systemic factors but not the strongest here), living alone (medium), education and employment (positive, so low risk), substance abuse and mental health (very low risk), background in an urban area (medium), and spiritual beliefs (low). \n\nThe majority of these are either low or medium. Since only one factor is high (arrest history without conviction isn't too severe but still significant), the overall risk might lean towards lower. However, arrest history is a notable point.\n\nI think I'll assign each factor accordingly, weigh them, and decide if the cumulative effect suggests he's likely to rearrest or not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"Youth can be associated with higher risk of impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"low\", \"Potential systemic issues but no direct evidence\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"high\", \"Arrest without conviction may indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of support networks could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"Education is neutral to slightly positive\"),\n    (\"two_jobs_past_year\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is generally protective\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_four_years\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"not_depressed_past_month\", \"high\", \"Good mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_large_household\", \"medium\", \"Urban area and family size could have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs_god\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can be protective but not a strong factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
