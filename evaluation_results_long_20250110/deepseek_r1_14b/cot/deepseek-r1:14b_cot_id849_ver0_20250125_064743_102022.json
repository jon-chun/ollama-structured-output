    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is on the younger side but not extremely so. Younger individuals might have higher risks due to immaturity, but it's not the highest weight here.\n\nNext, gender is female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so this should be a low factor.\n\nRace is White. I don't see race as a significant predictor in itself, unless there are systemic issues, which aren't indicated here, so probably low.\n\nArrest history: she's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can sometimes indicate lower risk if it was a minor offense, but it still counts as an arrest, so medium.\n\nEducation level is high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism; higher education can reduce the risk, so low here because she has a diploma but isn't furthering her education.\n\nEmployment: she's held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is a strong protective factor, indicating she has structure and financial stability, so medium.\n\nDrug use: no usage in four years. Abstaining from drugs for an extended period is very positive, so low risk here.\n\nMental health: she felt down in the dumps recently. While not severe, persistent feelings of depression can be a risk factor if they lead to substance abuse or other issues, but since it's recent and not chronic, medium weight.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. Stable family environment is protective; low risk here.\n\nReligious belief: she considers God influencing her life. Religious involvement is often associated with lower recidivism, so that's a low factor.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are low or medium. There's no strong high-risk factors, except perhaps the arrest history and mental health indicators. However, since there's no conviction and other protective factors like employment and education, overall risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; may have some influence on recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race is not a strong predictor of recidivism in itself\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction; arrests can be predictive even without convictions\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma may indicate some level of education and stability\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs suggests current employment stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could be a risk factor if persistent or severe\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable rural household\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide some level of support and stability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
