    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is quite young. Younger offenders are generally more at risk because they might not have stable lives yet and could be influenced more easily. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nRace might play a role in recidivism rates, but it's a sensitive area. I don't want to overemphasize this unless there's clear data suggesting otherwise. Maybe medium here since other factors are more impactful.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. A criminal history is a strong indicator of future offenses, so that should be high.\n\nHeight and weight, 6'1\" and 180 lbs., don't directly correlate with crime unless they're linked to certain types of crimes. I'd say low impact here.\n\nMarital status\u2014never married and living alone. Being single might mean less stability, but it's not a direct indicator. Maybe medium.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is positive; education can reduce recidivism. So that's a strong protective factor, high weight on the positive side.\n\nNo job in the past year is concerning because unemployment is linked to higher crime rates. That should be high as a risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior, so that's high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is good; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if untreated, but he's not showing signs now. Low impact here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household of six. Stable family might have protective effects, but living in an urban area could mean more exposure to crime. Maybe medium as the factors balance out slightly.\n\nReligious belief that God has a role in his life can be a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So high positive impact.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: two arrests and a conviction, unemployment, drug use\u2014all high negatives. Age 18 is high risk, education is positive, religion is positive. The negatives seem to outweigh the positives, especially with recent drug use and lack of employment. So I think he's likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age of 18 is a strong indicator for higher recidivism risk as younger offenders are less stabilized\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a factor, it's not the primary determinant here compared to other factors\"),\n    (\"criminal_history_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate past criminal behavior which correlates with future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism unless linked to specific crime types\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may suggest less stability but not a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"high\", \"Current enrollment in school is a protective factor, though past criminal behavior still poses risks\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year is a significant risk factor as unemployment correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is strongly linked to increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces some risk, though other factors remain critical\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both parents in an urban area; mixed impact as family stability can be protective but urban environment may expose to crime\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"high\", \"Strong belief in God's role in his life is a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
