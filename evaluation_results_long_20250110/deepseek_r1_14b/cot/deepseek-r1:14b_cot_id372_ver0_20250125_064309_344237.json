    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, so past arrests may have less impact than if she were older. However, being in her late teens can still be a risk factor as she's still developing.\n\nNext, gender is female. Generally, men have higher recidivism rates, but there are exceptions, especially if the crimes are similar. I don't see any immediate info on crime type here.\n\nRace is White. Race isn't typically a direct predictor, so I'd consider this low unless other factors interact with it, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's arrested three times and convicted once. The number of arrests suggests she might have ongoing issues, even though only one conviction. This should carry some weight as multiple arrests are often linked to higher recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime risk, so this is low.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Being unmarried can be a factor, but it's not definitive unless other stressors are present. So I'd rate this low.\n\nLiving alone might indicate isolation or lack of support systems, which could be a medium factor as social supports are known to reduce recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lower education is often linked with higher risk factors for crime due to limited opportunities. This seems like a medium impact.\n\nEmployment: She has held one job during the year. Stable employment can be protective, but since she only had one job, perhaps it's recent or unstable, so maybe low to medium. I'll go with medium here because having some employment is better than none, but not consistently known.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant factor. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, especially for drugs like cocaine which are more associated with criminal behavior. This should be high.\n\nDepressed mood: She's felt down all last month, nothing cheered her up. Depression can impair judgment and increase stress, leading to criminal behavior as an outlet or due to lack of coping mechanisms. High impact here as mental health is a strong predictor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological dad in a household of size 4. Family environment can influence behavior, but without more details on dysfunction, I'd rate this low.\n\nReligious views: Considers God has nothing to do with her fate. Low impact unless she's part of a religious community that provides support, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNow, considering all factors, drug use and mental health are high, arrest history is medium, employment status and education are medium, living alone and family background are low, age and gender are low. \n\nThe strongest predictors here are substance abuse and depression. These can lead to continued criminal activity as she might turn to drugs again or engage in crimes due to despair.\n\nTherefore, the prediction would be \"YES\" for rearrest, with confidence around 70% considering the high impact of drug use and mental health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old, which is a relatively young age but still beyond adolescence\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female, generally lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race, not typically a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"medium\", \"3 arrests indicating potential ongoing issues\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"1 conviction suggesting legal involvement\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, no direct link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED potentially limiting opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job, indicating some stability but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depressed mood can impair judgment and increase risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological father in a household of 4, no specific dysfunction noted\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"No belief in divine influence, not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
