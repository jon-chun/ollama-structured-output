    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 19. That's young, but often that's a high risk because younger people are more likely to commit crimes again. So probably high.\n\nHe's male and identifies as Black. I know that race can be a factor in recidivism rates, though it's complicated due to systemic issues. Still, this might be a medium factor.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he was just unlucky or maybe didn't have the resources for a proper defense. That's probably high risk because an arrest can indicate potential criminal behavior even if not convicted.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'4\", 170 lbs. I don't think physical stats are directly linked to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married. Single status isn't a strong indicator, but it could mean less family support, which might be medium or low. Maybe low unless there's more info on support systems.\n\nLiving alone\u2014this can be a risk factor because without the structure of family, someone might engage in criminal behavior. So that's medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism. Having a diploma is better than nothing but not engaging further could limit opportunities, so maybe low to medium. Let's say low since he has some education but no current enrollment.\n\nNo jobs during the year\u2014unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because it limits opportunities and increases idleness. Definitely high risk here.\n\nNo drug use in past four years\u2014that's good. Substance abuse often correlates with crime, so this would be a low factor.\n\nNo depression symptoms over the past month\u2014mental health issues can contribute to crime, so no depression is positive. Low risk factor.\n\nLived with biological mother in a 2-person rural household. Family dynamics and environment matter. Rural areas might have less access to resources or higher crime rates. Being in a small household could mean more influence from parents but if it's a high-crime area, that's negative. Let's say medium because of the rural aspect.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014religious involvement can be protective. People with strong religious ties often have lower recidivism rates, so this is low risk.\n\nNow, looking at all these factors: one arrest without conviction (high), living alone (medium), unemployment (high), others are low or not significant. The negative factors outweigh the positives, especially considering age and employment status.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old is a high risk factor for rearrest as younger individuals are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Identifying as Black can be a factor due to systemic issues and higher recidivism rates in some communities, though it's complex and varies widely.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"An arrest without conviction indicates potential criminal behavior or lack of legal resources, increasing rearrest likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism as it limits opportunities and increases idleness.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, potentially increasing risk factors for rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
