    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but at 22, it's on the lower end, so I wouldn't weight this too high.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race itself isn't a predictive factor, so that shouldn't influence the risk assessment.\n\nArrested once and convicted. A single conviction is a moderate risk factor because prior arrests are indicative of potential future issues, but one instance isn't overwhelmingly concerning.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I'll disregard those physical stats.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might reduce some support systems, which could be a slight risk factor, but it's probably low impact.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment can affect employability and opportunities. A GED is lower than a diploma, so this might slightly increase her risk, but it's not a major factor on its own.\n\nHeld 3 jobs in the year. Stable employment is actually a positive sign; it shows responsibility and integration into society. This should be protective against recidivism, so low weight here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Past drug use is a known risk factor for rearrest, especially if she has any history of substance abuse issues beyond just marijuana use. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nFeels down in dumps most of the time last month. Persistent sadness could indicate mental health issues or stressors that might lead to criminal behavior as an outlet. This is another medium factor because mental health can significantly impact recidivism.\n\nGrew up with biological dad in a household of 4, urban area. Family environment and socioeconomic factors can influence behavior, but without more specifics on family dynamics or trauma, this might be low impact unless there were issues like abuse or neglect, which aren't mentioned here. So I'll consider it low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personally. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism by offering a sense of purpose and community. This is protective, so low weight.\n\nNow, aggregating all these factors: two medium risks (drug use and mental health), a couple of lows related to employment and spiritual beliefs, and the rest are neutral or positive. There's no strong indication of high risk factors like multiple prior arrests, violent offenses, or severe mental illness.\n\nConsidering all this, the overall risk seems moderate but leans towards lower because there are more protective factors than significant risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is not a strong indicator of high recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One conviction indicates past criminal behavior, but it's not overly concerning given the single instance\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can be a risk factor for future offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Persistent sadness could indicate underlying mental health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 3 jobs shows some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs may provide support reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
