The prediction leans towards the individual being at higher risk for rearrest within three years (YES), with a confidence level of 75%. Factors indicating a higher risk include age (medium), race (high), arrest history (high), and drug use (medium). Conversely, marital status (low), employment history (low), and belief in divine intervention (low) are considered less influential. The living situation (medium) and early family environment (medium) also play roles in the assessment. This model aims to integrate various aspects of an individual's background and behaviors to provide a comprehensive risk prediction.",

He has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
