The prediction suggests a moderate risk of rearrest within three years due to significant factors like drug use and mental health issues, despite some protective factors such as stable family background and belief in a higher power. The confidence level is set at 65% to reflect the complexity and uncertainties inherent in predicting criminal behavior.",

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
