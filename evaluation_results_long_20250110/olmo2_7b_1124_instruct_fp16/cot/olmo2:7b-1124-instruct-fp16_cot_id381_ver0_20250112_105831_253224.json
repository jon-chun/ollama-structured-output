The recent depression and lack of cheer may also suggest substance influence issues.\n* **Depression symptoms:** **High** - Depression can significantly increase the risk of recidivism, as it impacts decision-making and emotional regulation.\n* **Family structure as a child:** **Medium** - Growing up in an intact family provides some protective effects against future criminal behavior; however, adverse experiences may negate this advantage.\n* **Belief in religion:** **Low** - While belief can offer moral or spiritual support, it does not directly influence the predictive weight for recidivism risk.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a **YES** to the prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism with **75% confidence**. The assessment considers a mix of protective (education and belief in religion) and risk-enhancing (past drug use, depression symptoms, and single living status) factors.",
