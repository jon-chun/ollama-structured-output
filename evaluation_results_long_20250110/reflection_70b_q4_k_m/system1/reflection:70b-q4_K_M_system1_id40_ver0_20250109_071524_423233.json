    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe this analysis is appropriate given the risk factors presented. The individual's history of arrests and convictions, lack of education and employment, drug use, and mental health concerns all contribute to a higher risk assessment. Additionally, his living situation, family dynamics in childhood, and spiritual outlook may indicate instability or potential for negative influences.\n\nThe confidence level of 85% reflects the presence of multiple significant risk factors across various aspects of the individual's life. While no single factor is definitive, the cumulative effect of these indicators strongly suggests a high-risk profile.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on the provided risk factors and my analysis as a risk assessment expert, I have determined that this individual presents a high risk.\n\nThe combination of several significant risk factors leads me to predict a higher likelihood of problematic behavior or potential for criminal activity. Some key indicators contributing to this assessment include:\n\n1. Criminal History: The person has been arrested multiple times and has a conviction record, which suggests a history of engaging in illegal activities.\n\n2. Socio-Economic Factors: He lacks formal education (no high school diploma or GED) and is currently unemployed, which can lead to increased frustration and desperation that may contribute to risky behavior.\n\n3. Substance Use: The individual has used drugs such as marijuana and cocaine within the past four years, including some use in the past month. This drug use history is a significant risk factor for criminal activity.\n\n4. Mental Health Concerns: He reported feeling down or depressed at times during the past month, which can increase vulnerability to negative influences or impulsive decisions.\n\n5. Unstable Living Situation: The person currently lives alone and has experienced living arrangements that were not with biological, foster, or adoptive parents in his youth, potentially indicating instability or lack of support structures.\n\n6. Limited Support Network: Being separated and lacking a stable family environment may further contribute to increased risk.\n\n7. Lack of Religious Influence: His belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally could indicate a sense of isolation from community support systems.\n\nWhile no single factor definitively determines an individual's behavior, the cumulative effect of these multiple risk factors across various aspects of his life leads me to conclude that this person presents a high risk. The confidence level in this assessment is 85%, reflecting both the presence and severity of these indicators.\n</output>",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
