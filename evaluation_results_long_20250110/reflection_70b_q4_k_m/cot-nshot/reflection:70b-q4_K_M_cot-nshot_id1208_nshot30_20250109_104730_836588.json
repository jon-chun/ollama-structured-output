    "raw_message_text": "Here's the solution to your problem, following all the specified requirements:\n\n<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, let's devise a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze each risk factor in the given case\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) based on their impact on recidivism\n3. Compare with n-shot examples to inform our analysis\n4. Make a prediction based on the weighted factors\n5. Calculate confidence level\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing risk factors:\n   - Age: 18 (young, potentially higher risk)\n   - Arrest history: 1 time convicted (moderate risk)\n   - Race: Black (potential bias in system, but not a direct factor for recidivism)\n   - Marital status: Never married (neutral)\n   - Education: No high school diploma or GED (higher risk)\n   - Employment: Held 2 jobs (lower risk)\n   - Drug use: Used marijuana in past 4 years (moderate risk)\n   - Mental health: Some depression symptoms (moderate risk)\n   - Family background: Lived with biological mother in urban area (neutral to low risk)\n   - Religious views: Believes God has some control (potentially lower risk)\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   - Age: High\n   - Arrest history: Medium\n   - Race: Low (not a direct factor for recidivism prediction)\n   - Marital status: Low\n   - Education: High\n   - Employment: Low\n   - Drug use: Medium\n   - Mental health: Medium\n   - Family background: Low\n   - Religious views: Low\n\n3. Comparing with n-shot examples:\n   The case shares similarities with Example 26 (age, arrest history, education) but differs in employment and family background.\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the weighted factors, particularly young age, lack of high school diploma, drug use, and some depression symptoms, there is an increased risk for recidivism.\n\n5. Calculating confidence level:\n   Given the combination of high-risk factors (age, education) and moderate-risk factors (arrest history, drug use, mental health), I would estimate a higher likelihood of recidivism but with some uncertainty due to positive factors like employment and family background.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive. However, I should consider that the model might give more weight to age and lack of education than other factors. Also, the presence of some depression symptoms could potentially increase the risk if not properly addressed.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on the detailed analysis of the given case and comparison with n-shot examples, here's the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age: 18\", \"high\", \"Young age is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Arrest history: 1 time convicted\", \"medium\", \"Previous conviction increases risk but not excessively high due to limited history\"),\n    (\"Lack of education: No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Limited educational background significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Employment: Held 2 jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk, though job duration and quality are unknown\"),\n    (\"Drug use: Used marijuana in past 4 years\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental health: Some depression symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Untreated mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nThis prediction indicates that based on the weighted analysis of risk factors, there is a significant likelihood (75% confidence) that this individual will be rearrested within 3 years. The high-risk factors such as young age and lack of education play a substantial role in this assessment, while positive factors like employment history slightly mitigate but do not outweigh these risks.\n\nIt's important to note that recidivism prediction models should be used with caution and considered alongside other factors for comprehensive risk assessment. Additionally, addressing specific issues through interventions (e.g., educational programs, job training, mental health support) could potentially alter this predicted outcome.\n</output>",
