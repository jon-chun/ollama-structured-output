The presence of drug use history, which consistently emerges as a high-risk factor across many examples.\n2. Indications of mental health issues (depression) that could increase vulnerability to negative behaviors or relapse.\n3. The lack of religious beliefs, which appears in several high-risk cases.\n4. Limited job stability and possibly immature behavior suggested by living alone at 19.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is not extremely high due to mitigating factors such as:\n1. The individual's young age with only one arrest history.\n2. Completion of a high school diploma.\n3. A stable family background in early life.\n4. No evidence of severe drug addiction or multiple convictions.\n\nThese mixed signals make it challenging to predict with absolute certainty, hence the moderate confidence level of 65%.\n</output>",
