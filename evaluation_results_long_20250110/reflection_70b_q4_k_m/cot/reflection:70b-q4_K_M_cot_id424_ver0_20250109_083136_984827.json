    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the given information about the individual and assign risk factors for recidivism. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. Identify potential risk factors from the provided information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Consider how these factors collectively influence the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n4. Make a prediction about whether this individual will be rearrested within 3 years.\n5. Estimate the confidence level in the prediction.\n\nLet's go through each piece of information and assign risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 19 - High risk (young adults are more likely to recidivate)\n2. Race: White - Low risk (some studies suggest lower recidivism rates for white females)\n3. Arrest history: 4 arrests, no convictions - Medium risk (multiple arrests indicate potential issues, but lack of convictions suggests they may not be severe)\n4. Physical characteristics: Height and weight - Not a significant factor\n5. Marital status: Never married - Low risk (not typically associated with higher recidivism rates for females)\n6. Living situation: Not living alone - Medium risk (potentially indicates instability or lack of independence)\n7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college - High risk (limited education is often linked to higher recidivism)\n8. Employment: Held 2 jobs in the past year - Low risk (some employment history is positive)\n9. Drug use: Past use of marijuana and cocaine - Medium risk (drug use is a factor, but not recent or severe enough to be high-risk)\n10. Mental health: No depression reported - Not a significant factor\n11. Childhood living situation: With biological mother in an urban area - Low risk (stable family environment despite urban setting)\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with her life - Medium risk (could be positive or negative influence)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe I've covered all relevant factors. However, I should also consider the interaction between these factors and how they might compound each other's effects. For example, limited education combined with a history of multiple arrests could increase overall risk.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's compile this information into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are more likely to recidivate\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White females tend to have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests indicate potential issues, but lack of convictions suggests they may not be severe\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Not typically associated with higher recidivism rates for females\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Potentially indicates instability or lack of independence\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Limited education is often linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Some employment history is positive, but limited\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, but not recent or severe enough to be high-risk\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment despite urban setting\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Could be positive or negative influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n<reflection>\nThe prediction and confidence level seem reasonable based on the factors analyzed. The individual has several high-risk factors (age, education) and some medium-risk factors that could contribute to a higher likelihood of recidivism within 3 years. However, there are also some low-risk factors that mitigate these concerns. A 70% confidence level reflects this mixed picture.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are more likely to recidivate\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White females tend to have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests indicate potential issues, but lack of convictions suggests they may not be severe\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Not typically associated with higher recidivism rates for females\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Potentially indicates instability or lack of independence\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Limited education is often linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Some employment history is positive, but limited\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, but not recent or severe enough to be high-risk\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment despite urban setting\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Could be positive or negative influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
