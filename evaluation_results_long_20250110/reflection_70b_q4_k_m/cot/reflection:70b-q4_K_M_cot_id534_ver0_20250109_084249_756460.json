    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assign a risk level (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each factor and assign a risk level:\n   - Age: 20-year-old male\n   - Race: Black\n   - Arrest history: 1 arrest, no convictions\n   - Physical appearance: 6'0\", 160 lbs\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living situation: Currently living alone\n   - Education: High school diploma, not in college\n   - Employment: Held 2 jobs in the past year\n   - Drug use: Used marijuana in past four years and past month\n   - Mental health: Felt down in dumps some of the time in the past month\n   - Childhood environment: Lived with biological parents in urban area\n   - Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal life\n\n2. Assign risk levels:\n   - Age: Low (young adults are generally at higher risk)\n   - Race: Medium (systemic factors may increase risk)\n   - Arrest history: Medium (first arrest, but no convictions yet)\n   - Physical appearance: Low (no significant factor in recidivism)\n   - Marital status: Medium (lack of stable relationships can increase risk)\n   - Living situation: High (living alone can indicate social isolation)\n   - Education: Medium (high school diploma is a positive factor)\n   - Employment: Medium (multiple jobs may indicate instability)\n   - Drug use: High (substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism)\n   - Mental health: Medium (some symptoms, but not severe)\n   - Childhood environment: Low (stable family structure, despite urban setting)\n   - Religious beliefs: Low (may be protective factor)\n\n3. Collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on these factors, there are several high and medium risk indicators that suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\n4. Determine confidence level:\n   The presence of multiple risk factors, especially the use of marijuana and living alone, increases the confidence in this prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe I've covered all relevant factors and assigned appropriate risk levels based on current research in criminal justice risk assessment. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and real-world predictions would require more detailed information and potentially additional assessments.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"20-year-old males are generally at higher risk for recidivism due to age-related impulsivity\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic factors may increase risk, but individual circumstances vary widely\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"First arrest with no convictions yet; still a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"Physical appearance\", \"low\", \"No significant factor in recidivism predictions\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is a positive factor, but not in college could be a missed opportunity for further education and skill-building\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs in the past year may indicate job instability or lack of commitment to employment\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use in past four years and past month is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential ongoing substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Some symptoms of depression, but not severe enough to be considered high risk at this point\"),\n    (\"Childhood environment\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure despite urban setting reduces childhood trauma as a risk factor\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May serve as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
