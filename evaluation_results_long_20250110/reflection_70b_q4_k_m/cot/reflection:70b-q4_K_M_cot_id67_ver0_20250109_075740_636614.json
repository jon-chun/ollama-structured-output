    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to develop a step-by-step plan to analyze each risk factor and then make a prediction based on these factors. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Analyze each piece of information provided as potential risk factors.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each assigned weight.\n4. Summarize all risk factors in a list.\n5. Based on the analysis, predict whether the individual is likely to be rearrested within 3 years (YES or NO).\n6. Assign a confidence level to this prediction (0-100%).\n\nLet's go through each piece of information and analyze it as potential risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 22\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Being young is often associated with higher crime rates, but 22 is not exceptionally young.\n\n2. Race/ethnicity: White\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: Research suggests that race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n3. Number of arrests: 3\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Multiple arrests are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\n4. Conviction history\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Having a conviction on record can increase the likelihood of future offenses, but it's not as strong as multiple arrests.\n\n5. Height and weight: 6'4\" & 180 lbs\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: Physical attributes are generally not good predictors of recidivism.\n\n6. Marital status: Never married\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Lack of stable relationships can be associated with higher crime rates, but it's not a strong factor alone.\n\n7. Living situation: Not living alone\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: This could actually be protective against recidivism as it suggests some level of social support.\n\n8. Education: High school diploma\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Having only a high school education may limit job opportunities, potentially increasing criminal behavior risk.\n\n9. College enrollment: Not enrolled\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: While beneficial for reducing recidivism, not being in college is common and not strongly predictive on its own.\n\n10. Employment history: Held 1 job during the year\n    Weight: Medium\n    Reasoning: Unstable employment can contribute to higher crime rates, but having a single job suggests some level of engagement.\n\n11. Drug use: Used marijuana in past four years\n    Weight: High\n    Reasoning: Recent drug use is strongly associated with increased recidivism risk.\n\n12. Mental health: No depression in the past month\n    Weight: Low\n    Reasoning: Lack of recent mental health issues suggests a lower risk for destructive behaviors.\n\n13. Family history:\n   - Age when living with biological mother: Young age\n   - Household size: 3\n   - Location: Rural area\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: An unstable or potentially dysfunctional family environment may increase recidivism risk, but the information is limited and mixed.\n\n14. Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with what happens personally\n    Weight: Low\n    Reasoning: While religion can be protective against crime, this belief alone doesn't strongly indicate lower recidivism risk.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and takes into account various aspects of the individual's life. However, it might be beneficial to emphasize that multiple factors interact to determine overall risk. The high weight assigned to drug use (marijuana) could potentially be downgraded slightly, as while it is a risk factor, marijuana use is relatively common among young adults.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's summarize and predict based on these factors:\n\nSummarized Risk Factors:\n- Multiple arrests: High\n- Drug use: Medium-High\n- Young age: Medium\n- Conviction history: Medium\n- Unstable employment: Medium\n- Limited education: Medium\n- Potentially unstable family background: Medium\n\nPrediction:\nBased on the analysis, it seems likely that this individual will be rearrested within 3 years. The combination of multiple arrests, recent drug use, young age, and other factors indicates a higher risk for recidivism.\n\nConfidence Level: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nAfter completing the analysis and prediction, I believe the assessment is comprehensive and takes into account various risk factors. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can always affect outcomes, so while there is a strong indication of potential recidivism, certainty cannot be guaranteed.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age: 22\", \"medium\", \"Being young is often associated with higher crime rates, but 22 is not exceptionally young.\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity: White\", \"low\", \"Research suggests that race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests: 3\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Having a conviction on record can increase the likelihood of future offenses, but it's not as strong as multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight: 6'4\\\" & 180 lbs\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are generally not good predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships can be associated with higher crime rates, but it's not a strong factor alone.\"),\n    (\"Living situation: Not living alone\", \"low\", \"This could actually be protective against recidivism as it suggests some level of social support.\"),\n    (\"Education: High school diploma\", \"medium\", \"Having only a high school education may limit job opportunities, potentially increasing criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"College enrollment: Not enrolled\", \"low\", \"While beneficial for reducing recidivism, not being in college is common and not strongly predictive on its own.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 1 job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to higher crime rates, but having a single job suggests some level of engagement.\"),\n    (\"Drug use: Used marijuana in past four years\", \"medium-high\", \"Recent drug use is strongly associated with increased recidivism risk, though marijuana use is relatively common among young adults.\"),\n    (\"Mental health: No depression in the past month\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent mental health issues suggests a lower risk for destructive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family history: Young age when living with biological mother, household size 3, rural area\", \"medium\", \"An unstable or potentially dysfunctional family environment may increase recidivism risk, but the information is limited and mixed.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with what happens personally\", \"low\", \"While religion can be protective against crime, this belief alone doesn't strongly indicate lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
