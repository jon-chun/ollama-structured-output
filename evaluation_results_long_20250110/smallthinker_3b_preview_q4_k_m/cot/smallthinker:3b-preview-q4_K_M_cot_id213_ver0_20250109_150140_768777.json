    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. Let me break down the factors one by one and think through them step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but not convicted. This suggests a pattern of involvement in law-breaking activities, which could indicate a higher risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign this factor a \"high\" weight.\n\nNext, his age and biological father living situation. At 22 years old, he is still young enough to be influenced by his environment. Living with his biological dad at a young age might have an impact on his life choices. Therefore, I'll give this factor a \"medium\" weight.\n\nNow, let's think about his educational background. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of higher education and possibly limited prospects for employment and financial stability. So, this factor will also be rated as \"high.\"\n\nLiving alone without any jobs for the past year suggests that he might be facing challenges in finding stable employment. This could contribute to his risk of recidivism, so I'll assign it a \"medium\" weight.\n\nHis substance use history is another important factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which may indicate potential issues with substance abuse. Therefore, this factor will be rated as \"high.\"\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might suggest he is currently not experiencing any mental health crises that could influence his behavior. This factor will be rated as \"low.\"\n\nHis biological dad's presence in his life at a young age could have influenced his life choices. So, I'll assign this factor a \"medium\" weight.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with what happens to him personally might indicate some level of spiritual beliefs or values that could influence his behavior. However, this is somewhat vague and doesn't provide clear evidence of recidivism risk, so I'll rate it as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism based on these factors. Given the pattern of arrests, limited education, substance use history, living situation, and lack of employment, it seems likely that he is at a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nFinally, I need to assign a confidence level. Based on the analysis, I'll rate this as 80%.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice but not convicted, suggesting a pattern of involvement in law-breaking activities.\"),\n    (\"age and biological father living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological dad at a young age may have influenced his life choices and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education and employment status\", \"high\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, indicating limited prospects for employment and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without any jobs for the past year may indicate challenges in finding stable employment and potentially contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"high\", \"He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which may indicate potential issues with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests that he is currently not experiencing any mental health crises that could influence his behavior.\"),\n    (\"biological dad's presence in life at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological dad at a young age may have had an impact on his life choices and behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
