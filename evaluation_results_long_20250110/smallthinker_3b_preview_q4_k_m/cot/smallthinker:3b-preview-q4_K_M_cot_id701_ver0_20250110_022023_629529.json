    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the given information step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the person's background. She is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. This racial/ethnic identity might be relevant in certain jurisdictions, but it does not significantly impact her risk level on its own. So, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This incident suggests some level of behavioral problems, which could indicate a higher risk. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"medium.\" Let me think about this further - the fact that it's not a conviction means it might be less severe than a typical arrest, so I'll keep it at medium.\n\nShe is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. These physical characteristics generally do not influence risk assessment in criminal justice settings. So, this factor remains \"low.\"\n\nHer living situation - currently living alone - does not provide a significant basis for assessing her risk level. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nShe has never been married, which might suggest independence but doesn't directly impact risk. This factor is also \"low.\"\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which could indicate substance abuse issues. However, it's not a severe issue like addiction or multiple drug types. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5. This information might be relevant in certain contexts, but generally, it does not significantly impact risk assessment. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This attitude towards spirituality may not directly influence her risk level in criminal justice settings. So, this factor is also \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's compile these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White racial/ethnic identity does not significantly impact risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\"),\n    (\"arrests_convicted\", \"medium\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests some level of behavioral problems, but not severe enough to warrant a high-risk designation.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not typically influence risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone does not provide significant basis for assessing risk level.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married does not directly impact risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana is a concern, but not severe enough to warrant a high-risk designation.\"),\n    (\"childhood_home_size\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents and household size is generally not indicative of significant risk factors for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_attitude\", \"low\", \"Attitude towards spirituality does not typically influence risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I've covered all necessary points. Yes, everything seems to be in order. The final step is to provide a confidence level based on the analysis. Given the factors considered, I would say there's moderate uncertainty about her future behavior, so I'll assign a 60% confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White racial/ethnic identity does not significantly impact risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\"),\n    (\"arrests_convicted\", \"medium\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests some level of behavioral problems, but not severe enough to warrant a high-risk designation.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not typically influence risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone does not provide significant basis for assessing risk level.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married does not directly impact risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana is a concern, but not severe enough to warrant a high-risk designation.\"),\n    (\"childhood_home_size\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents and household size is generally not indicative of significant risk factors for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_attitude\", \"low\", \"Attitude towards spirituality does not typically influence risk assessment in criminal justice settings.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
