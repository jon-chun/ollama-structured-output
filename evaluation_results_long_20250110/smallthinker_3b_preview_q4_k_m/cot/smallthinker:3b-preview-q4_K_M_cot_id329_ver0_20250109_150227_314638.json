    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant point that needs careful consideration. Arrests are a strong indicator of future criminal behavior. Given this, I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, let's consider the drug use. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this is not an ongoing issue, it does indicate a history of substance abuse, which can be a risk factor. However, since she hasn't used them recently and doesn't feel depressed now, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's think about her living situation. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests that she might have unstable living arrangements, which could increase the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities. This factor will also be assigned a high weight.\n\nHer past incarceration is another critical factor. She has been convicted twice, which means she has already demonstrated a propensity for criminal behavior. This factor will be given a very high weight.\n\nEducation and employment history are important as well. She has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college. Additionally, she has held only two jobs during the year. These factors suggest that she may have limited educational attainment and job stability, which could impact her future behavior. I'll assign these a medium to high weight.\n\nHer perception of spirituality is an interesting factor. She believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate a strong moral compass or a sense of accountability, depending on how it's interpreted. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nFinally, let's consider her living environment in the past. She lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area. While this doesn't directly correlate to future behavior, it does provide insight into her upbringing and potential social influences. This factor will be assigned a medium weight.\n\nNow that I have considered all factors, let's compile them into a JSON object format as requested:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"High arrest rate indicates propensity for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, although not recent, suggests potential for substance-related involvement.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Unstable living situation may increase likelihood of involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"very_high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate established pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"medium_to_high\", \"Limited education and job stability may impact future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is somewhat vague and lacks direct correlation to future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Past Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Household size and urban location provide context for upbringing.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nThis JSON object reflects my detailed analysis of each risk factor and the collective prediction based on them.",
