    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting future criminal behavior. Given the severity of these incidents, I would assign this risk factor a high weight.\n\nNext, we look at his physical attributes. His height and weight are within normal ranges, but there's no direct link to criminal behavior based on physical characteristics alone. Therefore, this factor will be assigned a low or medium weight depending on its relevance to the context.\n\nHis educational background is another important factor. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lack of formal education and potential future criminal involvement due to limited prospects for employment. Given this, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nLiving conditions are also worth considering. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6 at an early age. While living in larger households can sometimes lead to behavioral issues, the specific context here is not clearly indicative of criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor a low or medium weight depending on its relevance.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only one job during the year. This could indicate difficulties finding stable employment and potentially increased likelihood of future criminal activity. Given this, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nThe drug use history is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. However, some time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests emotional distress but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor a low or medium weight depending on its relevance.\n\nHis consideration of God's role in personal life indicates a potential lack of direction and values, which might lead to criminal behavior if he feels disconnected from societal norms. Given this, I would assign this factor a low or medium weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize the weights:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior that warrants a high risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"medium\", \"While his physical attributes are within normal ranges, there is no direct link to criminal behavior.

The specific circumstances do not suggest a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has only held one job during the year, indicating difficulties finding stable employment and potentially increased likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"There is no evidence of drug use in the past four years, but some emotional distress may lead to risky behaviors. The lack of direct correlation with recidivism makes this factor low.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
