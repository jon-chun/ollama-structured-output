    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess each risk factor for a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. Being a young adult with no prior convictions might suggest lower risk, but the context of his arrest is important. I'll assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\nNext, his height and weight range are within normal limits, so that doesn't seem like a significant factor for risk assessment. Therefore, \"low\".\n\nMarital status: currently living alone with no family responsibilities. This suggests low risk as well.\n\nEducation level: he has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. Given his age and circumstances, this seems reasonable. So, \"low\".\n\nEmployment history: only one job during the year. That's consistent with someone who might be exploring different opportunities or has limited work experience. I'll also assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\nSubstance use: he has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This suggests a lower risk of substance-related problems, so \"low\".\n\nHome environment: living with his biological mother in a large household. This might indicate some support but could also mean more family stress. I'll assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nBelief in divine intervention: he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This doesn't directly impact risk assessment, so it's not assigned any weight here.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to make a prediction and confidence level. The combination of lower substance use and current living situation suggests lower risk, but the age factor is important. Given this, I'll predict \"NO\" with high confidence, around 85%.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The person is a young adult with no prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"While being Black or male may influence societal perceptions of crime, this individual has not been convicted and has other mitigating factors.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant risk factor related to physical attributes.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone with no family responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment, consistent with age and circumstances.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Only one job during the year, suggesting exploration of opportunities or limited work experience.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Has used drugs in the past four years but not felt depressed recently.\"),\n    (\"home_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a large household, potentially indicating some support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
