    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate the risk factors associated with a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested multiple times. Let me break down each factor and assign a relative weight based on its potential impact on 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history:\n- He has been arrested 9 times.\n- He has convictions.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- Some of the time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up.\n\nGiven these factors, I would classify the arrest frequency and drug use as high risk. The multiple arrests and drug use suggest a pattern of behavior that may be linked to criminal activity. Let me think about this further.\n\nNext, let's look at his personal life:\n- He has never been married.\n- He is currently living alone.\n- He has held only one job during the year.\n\nLiving alone without a stable support system and having limited employment history could indicate social isolation and a lack of support, which are significant risk factors for recidivism. I would also classify this as high risk.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational background:\n- He has a GED certificate.\n- He is not enrolled in college.\n\nWhile having a GED suggests some level of education, the fact that he is not enrolled in college could indicate limited opportunities and potential lack of motivation for positive change. I would classify this as medium risk.\n\nNext, let's examine his living history:\n- He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when young.\n- He considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLiving in a large household and believing in the influence of God on personal life could provide a sense of community and spiritual guidance. However, the size of the household might not necessarily indicate a risk factor for recidivism. I would classify this as low risk.\n\nFinally, let's consider his overall behavior:\n- He has used drugs.\n- Some feelings of depression.\n\nThese factors suggest potential substance abuse issues and mental health concerns, both of which are significant risk factors for recidivism. I would classify these as high risk.\n\nNow, let me think about the collective impact of these risk factors. The combination of arrest history, drug use, limited employment, living alone, lack of education, and current beliefs could collectively increase the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that this individual is at a high risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_frequency\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of non-compliance with the justice system and potential disregard for the law.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of drugs, particularly marijuana, and feelings of depression may indicate substance abuse issues and mental health concerns.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Limited employment history and lack of education may suggest a lack of positive role models and limited opportunities for growth.\"),\n    (\"living_history\", \"low\", \"Living with a large household and considering God's influence may provide a sense of community and spiritual guidance, but not necessarily indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"personal_life\", \"high\", \"Currently living alone without a stable support system and feeling down may indicate social isolation and potential risk factors for substance abuse and mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

He has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
