    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors and consider their potential impact on recidivism:\n\n1. **Male**, Hispanic: This demographic doesn't have a strong correlation with recidivism rates in my experience. So, I'll assign it a low weight.\n2. **Two arrests, not convicted**: While this is concerning, it does not necessarily indicate a high risk of recidivism without conviction history. Therefore, I'll also assign this a low weight.\n3. **Height and weight**: These physical characteristics do not directly correlate with recidivism rates. So, another low weight for this factor.\n4. **Married**, living with spouse: This suggests stability and support, which generally reduces the risk of recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n5. **High school diploma**, no college enrollment: Education level does not directly correlate with recidivism rates. So, another low weight for this factor.\n6. **Unemployed**: Unemployment can be a risk factor, but it's important to note that many individuals in this situation are transitioning or exploring options. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n7. **Past use of drugs (marijuana)**: Past drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this a high weight.\n8. **No feeling depressed**: Lack of depression suggests a lower likelihood of impulsive or violent behavior, so I'll assign this a low weight.\n9. **Lived with 6 people in an urban household at young age**: This could indicate exposure to violence and substance use, which are risk factors for recidivism. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n10. **Believes God has something to do with personal life**: This is more of a philosophical stance and does not directly correlate with recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which is a significant risk factor.\n- They have been unemployed for some time, which also indicates potential instability.\n- They have no feeling of depression, which reduces the likelihood of impulsive behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll predict that they will be rearrested within three years. The confidence level is moderate to high due to the combination of risk factors and the stability factor from being married.\n\nLet me summarize this in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male\", \"low\", \"This demographic does not have a strong correlation with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Hispanic\", \"low\", \"Similarly, ethnicity does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Two arrests, not convicted\", \"low\", \"While concerning, arrest history without conviction does not necessarily indicate high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Married\", \"low\", \"This suggests stability and support, which generally reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma, no college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Education level does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Unemployed\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can be a risk factor for recidivism, but it is important to note that many individuals in this situation are transitioning or exploring options.\"),\n    (\"Past use of drugs (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No feeling depressed\", \"low\", \"Lack of depression suggests a lower likelihood of impulsive or violent behavior.\"),\n    (\"Lived with 6 people in an urban household at young age\", \"medium\", \"This could indicate exposure to violence and substance use, which are risk factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse.
