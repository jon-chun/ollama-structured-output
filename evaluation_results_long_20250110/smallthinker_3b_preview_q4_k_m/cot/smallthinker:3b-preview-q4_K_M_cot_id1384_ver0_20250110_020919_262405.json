    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information about a 19-year-old American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut female with specific circumstances. Let me break down the factors one by one and assign them appropriate weights.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. Being a young adult with these demographic characteristics could influence her risk profile due to societal expectations and potential biases. However, this factor alone doesn't seem to significantly increase or decrease her risk level. So, I'll categorize it as low.\n\nNext, the fact that she has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted is intriguing. While not a conviction, these arrests indicate some level of involvement with the legal system. However, without further information on the severity of offenses or any patterns in her behavior, this factor also falls into the low category.\n\nHer physical attributes, such as height and weight, don't seem to directly impact her risk profile related to crime or recidivism. So, I'll keep this at a low weight.\n\nMarriage and living with her spouse could potentially influence her actions and choices, but without more context on how these relationships affect her behavior, I'll also categorize this as low.\n\nThe lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate and not being enrolled in college might suggest some educational disadvantages. However, it's unclear how significant this is in terms of criminal risk. So, I'll keep this at a low weight as well.\n\nHer employment history is sparse, holding only one job during the year. This could indicate potential difficulties in securing stable work, but again, without more context on her job performance or reasons for unemployment, it's hard to gauge its impact on her crime risk. Therefore, I'll categorize this as low.\n\nThe fact that she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant concern. Drug use can be linked to increased criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like unemployment or lack of education. This factor seems important enough to be medium-weighted.\n\nHer recent feelings of depression, described as \"so down that nothing could cheer her up,\" suggest mental health issues. Mental health problems have been linked to higher rates of substance abuse and potentially increased criminal activity. This is a strong risk factor, so I'll categorize it as high.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area might indicate some level of family support or challenges. However, without more information on the nature of these relationships and their impact on her behavior, I'll keep this at a low weight.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally could influence her actions and decisions. While faith can be protective in many cases, it's also possible that it could lead to more impulsive or less rational decisions. Given the limited information, I'll categorize this as medium-weighted.\n\nNow, let me summarize my findings:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"This factor is considered low because while being a young adult can influence risk profile due to societal expectations and potential biases, it does not significantly impact her crime risk without further context.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"The gender of the individual does not appear to be a significant factor in this case as there is no specific data suggesting that it affects their likelihood of committing crime.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight do not directly impact crime risk without additional context on how they might influence behavior or interactions with others.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage status does not seem to be a significant factor in this case as there is no specific data suggesting that it affects her likelihood of committing crime.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate and not being enrolled in college might suggest some educational disadvantages but without further context on how these factors impact her behavior, they are considered low weight factors.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year could indicate potential difficulties in securing stable work but this factor does not significantly increase or decrease her crime risk without additional information.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"medium\", \"Her history of drug use over the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, is a significant concern as it can be linked to increased criminal behavior.
