    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male who has been arrested once, convicted, lives alone, and is currently enrolled in school. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. An 18-year-old with a prior conviction will likely face higher scrutiny from justice officials, which increases the risk of further offenses. This factor should be assigned a high weight.\n\nNext, I'll think about his employment status. Holding only one job during the year is relatively common for young adults. However, it does indicate a lack of stability and experience in the workforce. This factor should be rated as medium-high.\n\nNow, let's consider his living situation. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation and a lack of social support. However, it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior unless combined with other factors. I'll assign this a low-medium weight.\n\nHis educational status is important. Being enrolled in school at 18 years old indicates a commitment to education and potentially reduced risk of crime. This factor should be rated as low.\n\nThe use of drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, is a significant factor. While it's not necessarily indicative of criminal intent alone, repeated substance use can lead to impaired decision-making and increased likelihood of risky behaviors. This factor should be assigned a medium-high weight.\n\nDepression is another important factor. The person has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that they are currently in a stable emotional state. This factor should be rated as low.\n\nHis biological mother's household background from an urban area may have influenced his upbringing and possibly his exposure to criminal activities. However, this factor is less direct and therefore should be assigned a low-medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief in God not being involved with personal life indicates a lack of moral compass or ethical guidance. This factor should be rated as medium.\n\nLet me check the overall risk assessment based on these factors:\n- Arrest and conviction history: high\n- Employment status: medium-high\n- Living situation: low-medium\n- Educational status: low\n- Drug use: medium-high\n- Depression: low\n- Household background: low-medium\n- Belief in God: medium\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given that he has a prior conviction and has used drugs, these factors suggest a higher risk of rearrest. However, his education and living situation somewhat mitigate this risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the person has a moderate to high risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction increases risk of further offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium-high\", \"Holding one job during the year indicates lack of stability, but not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior alone.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low-medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, but not directly correlated with increased crime risk unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"educational status\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school at 18 years old suggests commitment to education and potentially reduced crime risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium-high\", \"Repeated drug use can impair decision-making and increase likelihood of risky behaviors, but not necessarily indicative of criminal intent alone.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests current stability and low risk for impulsive or violent behavior.\"),\n    (\"household background\", \"low-medium\", \"Growing up in an urban household with biological mother may have influenced upbringing, but factor is less direct.\"),\n    (\"belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal life suggests lack of moral compass or ethical guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment.
