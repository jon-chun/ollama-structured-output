    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested twice, convicted, lives alone in an urban area, and uses drugs. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. This factor should be given a high weight because repeated arrests suggest a pattern of illegal activities.\n\nNext, his conviction. Being convicted on at least one offense indicates a clear record of law-breaking. This factor should also be weighted as high because it directly correlates with the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nThe current age and living situation are important but relatively less significant compared to criminal history. Living alone in an urban area might suggest greater freedom, but the arrest history outweighs this consideration.\n\nEducation and employment status. The individual has a GED certificate and no jobs, which could indicate limited educational benefits from formal schooling and possibly increased exposure to crime due to lack of structured life path. However, given the strong criminal history, this factor is less impactful than repeated arrests or convictions.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. While he uses marijuana in the past four years, it doesn't seem to be a significant issue for recidivism. The absence of depression over the past month further reduces the risk of future offenses based on mental health concerns.\n\nHis upbringing and personal beliefs are less directly relevant to the prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism, so they should be weighted as low.\n\nLet me check my analysis again to ensure I haven't missed anything. The arrest history and conviction clearly stand out as high-risk factors, while other aspects like education, employment, drug use, living situation, and upbringing are less impactful in this context.\n\nNow, let's assign the weights:\n\n- Arrest History: High\n- Conviction: High\n- Current Age and Living Situation: Low\n- Education and Employment Status: Low\n- Drug Use: Low\n- Upbringing and Personal Beliefs: Low\n\nWith these factors in mind, I can confidently predict a high risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests strongly suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Conviction\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates a clear record of law-breaking.\"),\n    (\"Current Age and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lives alone in an urban area, but arrest history outweighs this factor.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment Status\", \"low\", \"GED certificate, no jobs, but arrest history is more significant.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Uses marijuana in the past four years, but no depression over the past month suggests low risk of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing and Personal Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, considers God's role, which is less relevant to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 168 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
