    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of a 19-year-old male White individual being rearrested again within three years. He's had two arrests but hasn't been convicted yet. Let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is relatively young. Being in that age group might indicate a higher potential for impulsive behavior or experimentation with illegal activities. So, I'd say the risk of recidivism here could be medium to high, but let's consider other factors.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Single individuals might have different risks compared to those who are in relationships. Maybe it's low risk, but I need to think about how living alone could influence his actions. Perhaps no significant impact on recidivism risk based on this factor alone.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Does that suggest any particular vulnerabilities? Well, completing high school might indicate some responsibility or at least an understanding of the consequences of illegal activities. Maybe low to medium risk here.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. That suggests he has had employment recently, which could indicate stability or perhaps even a lack thereof if he was fired multiple times. Hmm, maybe medium risk.\n\nDrugs: He's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and some days in the past month felt down to the point where nothing could cheer him up. These are indicators of substance use and mental health issues. Substance use can be a significant factor in criminal behavior, and mental health concerns might also play a role. So, this could be medium to high risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a household size of four when he was younger. Living in close quarters might provide support or perhaps even foster an environment where illegal activities are more tolerated. It's unclear how this directly affects recidivism risk, but it's something to consider. Maybe low to medium risk.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is a bit vague, but it might indicate some level of belief in divine intervention or perhaps a sense of morality being influenced by religious beliefs. I'm not sure how this directly relates to recidivism risk, but it could suggest that he perceives certain actions as wrong due to his beliefs.\n\nNow, let's try to assign weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: Medium\n\n2. Arrests (not convicted): Low to medium\n\n3. Living situation: Low to medium\n\n4. Education level: Low to medium\n\n5. Employment history: Medium\n\n6. Drug use: High\n\n7. Household dynamics: Low to medium\n\n8. Belief in divine intervention: Low\n\nConsidering that drug use is a high risk factor, and arrests might be indicative of future criminal behavior, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's medium.\n\nOverall, the combination of drug use and possibly unstable living situation could push this into a higher risk category.\n\nPrediction:\n\nBased on these assessments, I'd say the 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction is \"YES,\" indicating a likely possibility of being rearrested within three years.\n\nConfidence: Let's say 70%.\n\nSo, the JSON object would look like this:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may indicate impulsivity or experimentation, but in terms of recidivism, it could vary.\"),\n\n(\"arrests_not_convicted\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction might suggest some level of criminal behavior, but since not convicted, perhaps this factor is less critical for prediction.\"),\n\n(\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may or may not influence recidivism risk; it's unclear how living situation affects future behavior.\"),\n\n(\"education_level\", \"low_to_medium\", \"GED and no college enrollment might indicate some level of responsibility, but mental health concerns are more relevant here.\"),\n\n(\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs suggest stability in employment, which could mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n\n(\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, especially current feelings of depression, may indicate substance abuse issues and potential criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\"),\n\n(\"household_dynamics\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Living with biological mother at household size 4; unclear how this directly affects recidivism risk.\"),\n\n(\"belief_in_divine_intervention\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role in personal life may influence moral compass, but it's not a direct indicator of future criminal behavior.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}",
