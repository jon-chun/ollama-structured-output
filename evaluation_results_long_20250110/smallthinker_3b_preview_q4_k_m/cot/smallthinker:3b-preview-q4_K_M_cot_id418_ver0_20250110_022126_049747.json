    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess the given information regarding a 20-year-old male Asian / Pacific Islander who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider his age and gender. At 20 years old, he's in a high-risk period for criminal behavior. However, with no prior convictions, the impact of this factor seems to be somewhat mitigated. So, let me assign \"medium\" weight to this risk factor.\n\nNext, I'll look at his physical attributes. He's 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. While these can influence an individual's likelihood of involvement in crime, they don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Thus, I'll assign \"low\" weight to this factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. This suggests he might have some educational background but may lack the higher education that often comes with more stable employment opportunities. However, the absence of a conviction also plays a role here. So, let me consider \"medium\" for this risk factor.\n\nHe's currently living alone and has never been married. While living alone can sometimes indicate independent behavior, it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal activity. Therefore, I'll assign \"low\" to this factor as well.\n\nHis job history shows he has only held one job during the year. This could imply some level of instability or potential for reoffending if his current situation changes. However, combined with no convictions and using drugs in the past four years but not feeling depressed recently, I'll assign \"low\" to this risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, especially when it occurs within a short timeframe. This suggests a higher weight on this risk factor.\n\nLiving with an 8-person household at a young age could indicate exposure to various influences that might impact his behavior. While not directly correlating to crime, the level of family dynamics and peer influence is significant. Thus, I'll assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nConsidering his belief in God having something to do with what happens to him personally, it seems he has some form of spirituality or personal beliefs. This can sometimes influence behavior, especially if it includes a sense of responsibility or moral guidance. However, the lack of conviction and other factors suggest a lower weight on this risk factor.\n\nLet me now aggregate these weights:\n\n- Arrested once but not convicted (medium)\n- Physical attributes (low)\n- High school diploma with no college enrollment (medium)\n- Living alone and never married (low)\n- Job history (low)\n- Drug use in the past four years but no depression (high)\n- Household size at a young age (medium)\n- Belief in God's influence (low)\n\nNow, let me calculate the prediction. Given the aggregated weights and considering all factors, I predict:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested once but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating a potential for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"The individual's physical attributes do not strongly correlate with an increased risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and no college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"While having a high school diploma may suggest some level of education, the lack of college enrollment could indicate limited job opportunities or a higher likelihood of reoffending if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Living alone and never married\", \"low\", \"The individual's living situation does not strongly correlate with an increased risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"low\", \"Having only held one job during the year may suggest some level of instability or potential for reoffending if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in the past four years but no depression\", \"high\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior. However, the lack of current depression may indicate a lower likelihood of immediate involvement in crime.\"),\n    (\"Household size at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Living with an 8-person household at a young age may have exposed the individual to various influences that could impact his behavior, but this is not strongly correlated with criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's influence\", \"low\", \"The individual believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which may indicate a sense of morality or responsibility. However, this belief does not strongly correlate with an increased risk of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
