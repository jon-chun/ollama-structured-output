    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign a risk weight to each factor before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. A female aged 19 is generally considered at low risk due to societal norms and higher likelihood of rehabilitation. So, I'll assign a \"low\" weight here.\n\nNext, her arrest history. She has been arrested twice and convicted, which indicates significant criminal behavior. This factor should be weighted as \"high\". Let me think about this for a moment... The fact that she has already had two arrests suggests a pattern of behavior that may continue, so it's important to consider this heavily in the risk assessment.\n\nHer height and weight are relatively average, with no indicators of physical danger or vulnerability. Therefore, I'll assign a \"low\" weight here.\n\nMarital status is not directly linked to criminal risk factors, but being married can sometimes indicate a support system that may mitigate crime. However, given her other factors, I'll still assign a \"low\" weight.\n\nEducation and employment history are also important. She has no high school diploma or GED certificate and does not have any college enrollment. Additionally, she has held only one job during the past year. This suggests limited social connections and possibly lower employability, which could be linked to criminal behavior. I'll assign a \"high\" weight here.\n\nSubstance abuse is another critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, with marijuana being a common substance and cocaine indicating a more severe issue. Additionally, she feels so down that nothing can cheer her up during the past month, which suggests depression or mental health issues. These factors should be weighted as \"high\".\n\nLiving conditions are also relevant. Growing up in a household of size 4 in a rural area does not indicate specific risk factors related to crime, but it's important to consider any behavioral patterns that may have developed due to these living conditions. I'll assign a \"low\" weight here.\n\nFinally, her belief in God is not directly linked to criminal behavior and can be seen as a mitigating factor for some individuals. Therefore, I'll assign a \"low\" weight here.\n\nNow, let's aggregate these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the pattern of arrest history, substance abuse, and limited education and employment, it seems likely that she may reoffend within three years. Therefore, I'll assign a \"NO\" prediction with a confidence level of 80%.\n\nLet me check my thoughts one more time to ensure everything is considered. Yes, this comprehensive analysis leads me to the following JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"A female aged 19 is generally considered at low risk due to societal norms and higher likelihood of rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"A history of arrest and conviction indicates significant criminal behavior, suggesting a pattern that may continue.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"No indicators of physical danger or vulnerability; average measurements are not linked to crime risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can sometimes indicate a support system but is not directly linked to crime risk factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED and no college enrollment suggest limited social connections and possibly lower employability, which could be linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Only one job during the past year indicates a lack of stable employment and possible criminal involvement in the past.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and feelings of depression/sadness are indicators of higher risk for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a rural household does not indicate specific crime-related issues but is considered generally safe.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is not directly linked to crime risk factors and can be seen as a mitigating factor for some individuals.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
