    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested only once, but that doesn't mean she won't be arrested again. This is a significant factor, especially for someone with no prior convictions. I'll rate this as high because it suggests a recent and potentially serious issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nNext, I'll look at her age. At 19 years old, she's still in the early stages of her life, which means there's more room for growth and development. This factor is low because it doesn't indicate any immediate danger or risk.\n\nHer height and weight are also important factors. They don't directly relate to criminal behavior, but they could influence how she interacts with law enforcement. These factors are also low in terms of risk.\n\nLiving alone might suggest a lack of support system, which could be a factor for someone at high risk of recidivism. However, this is a bit subjective and depends on other factors like employment and education. I'll keep it as low.\n\nHer educational background is another important factor. Having a GED certificate suggests she has some basic skills but may not have the higher-level education that could provide better opportunities and reduce her risk of recidivism. This factor is also low.\n\nEmployment status is crucial here. She's held only one job in a year, which indicates unemployment or underemployment. This is a medium-risk factor because it suggests she might be at high risk of not having a stable income, which could lead to criminal behavior as a means of survival. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHer substance abuse history is significant. She has used drugs, including marijuana and cocaine, and reports feeling down almost all the time. This indicates a pattern of substance abuse that could be linked to her increased risk of recidivism. I'll rate this as high.\n\nThe household size and structure at a young age are also important. Living with both biological parents in a large household suggests some level of familial support, which is positive. This factor is low.\n\nHer belief in God might influence her decision-making but doesn't directly affect her risk of recidivism. This factor is low.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested once, which may indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is still relatively young and may have more time to reform.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"These factors do not directly relate to criminal behavior but could influence how she interacts with law enforcement.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which could be a factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate suggests some level of education and skills, but not necessarily a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job in the past year may indicate unemployment or underemployment, potentially increasing her risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse history\", \"high\", \"The individual has used drugs and reports feeling down most of the time, indicating a pattern of substance abuse that could increase her risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size and structure at age 15\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a large household suggests some level of familial support.\"),\n    (\"belief in God\", \"low\", \"This factor does not directly influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested once, which may indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is still relatively young and may have more time to reform.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"These factors do not directly relate to criminal behavior but could influence how she interacts with law enforcement.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which could be a factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate suggests some level of education and skills, but not necessarily a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job in the past year may indicate unemployment or underemployment, potentially increasing her risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse history\", \"high\", \"The individual has used drugs and reports feeling down most of the time, indicating a pattern of substance abuse that could increase her risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size and structure at age 15\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a large household suggests some level of familial support.\"),\n    (\"belief in God\", \"low\", \"This factor does not directly influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
