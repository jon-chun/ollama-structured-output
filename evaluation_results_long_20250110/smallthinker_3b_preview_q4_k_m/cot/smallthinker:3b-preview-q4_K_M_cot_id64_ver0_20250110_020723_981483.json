    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old White female who has been arrested once, convicted, lives alone in an urban area, and has used drugs in the past. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested only once, which is a relatively low-risk situation. However, having a conviction still carries some weight, so I'll rate it as medium risk.\n\nNext, let's look at her educational background. She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she might not have the same opportunities for higher education or career advancement as someone with more formal education. So, I'll assign this a low risk factor.\n\nHer living situation is another important aspect. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase the likelihood of substance use and other risky behaviors. However, it's also possible that living alone provides some sense of independence and autonomy. Given these mixed factors, I'll rate her living situation as medium risk.\n\nNow, let's consider her employment history. She has held only one job during the year. This could indicate instability or a lack of career progression, but it might also be due to various life circumstances such as school attendance or other responsibilities. Therefore, I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nHer drug use is another critical factor. Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana) increases the risk of substance-related issues and potential recidivism. Given her current situation and the context, I'll assign a medium risk to her drug use.\n\nDepression is an important factor, but she has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that she currently does not have depression, which reduces the risk of recidivism associated with it. So, this will be rated as low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area during her childhood is significant. Growing up in such circumstances can shape one's values and behaviors in profound ways. I'll assign this a medium risk factor.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally could provide a sense of meaning and purpose. However, it might also lead to avoidance of seeking professional help or engaging in risky behaviors due to faith-based beliefs. Therefore, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nNow, let's compile these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest is relatively low-risk, but a conviction still carries some weight.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and has a significant impact on recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase the risk of substance use and other risky behaviors, but it may also provide independence and autonomy.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Only one job in the past year suggests instability or lack of career progression, but this could be due to various factors such as school attendance or other responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Using drugs in the past four years increases the risk of substance-related issues and potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month reduces the likelihood of depression-related risks, such as increased substance use or poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a household of size 4 can shape values and behaviors, but it does not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with what happens to her personally may provide a sense of meaning and purpose, but could also lead to avoidance of seeking professional help or engaging in risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object encapsulates the risk factors and their weights, along with a prediction and confidence level for the 3-year rearrest recidivism.",
