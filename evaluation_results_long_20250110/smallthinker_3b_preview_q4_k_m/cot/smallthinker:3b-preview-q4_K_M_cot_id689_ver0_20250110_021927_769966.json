    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 20 years old, he is still relatively young, which might suggest a higher likelihood of risk-taking behavior. However, as an adult, his legal status and potential for rehabilitation should also be considered. Let me think about this... Given that he has been convicted, I would assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nNext, his conviction history. He has been arrested once and convicted, which clearly indicates a higher risk of reoffending. This seems straightforward, so I'll assign \"high\" to this factor.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical characteristics. His height and weight are relatively average for an adult male. There is no clear indication that these factors contribute significantly to the risk of reoffending. So, I'll assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\nLiving situation is another important factor. He is currently living alone, which might suggest a higher likelihood of isolation but also greater personal freedom. Let me think... Since there's no direct link to criminal behavior, I'll assign \"low\".\n\nEducation level and employment history are crucial. With a high school diploma and only 2 jobs in the past year, it seems he has limited education and job experience. This might increase his risk of unemployment and potentially reoffending. So, I'll assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nDrug use is also significant. His recent marijuana use and feelings of depression could indicate a higher likelihood of substance abuse or impaired judgment. Let me check... Given the context, I'll assign \"high\".\n\nFamily background is another aspect. Living with his biological dad in a household of size 3 might suggest some level of family support, but it's also possible that this environment contributed to his behavior. So, I'll assign \"medium\".\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its role in his life. This seems more related to personal beliefs than direct criminal risk factors. Therefore, I'll assign \"low\".\n\nNow, let's consider all these factors together. The high conviction history and recent drug use suggest a higher risk of reoffending. However, the limited education and employment history also play a significant role. Let me calculate the collective risk... \n\nAfter careful consideration, I conclude that he has a moderate to high likelihood of reoffending.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, this individual is still relatively young with potential for learning and growth.
