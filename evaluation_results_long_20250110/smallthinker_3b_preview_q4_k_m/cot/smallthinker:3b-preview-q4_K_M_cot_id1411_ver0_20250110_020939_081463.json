    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor for a 22-year-old male White defendant with a complex history. Let me break down the factors step-by-step and think about their relative weights.\n\nFirst, let's look at his arrest record. The defendant has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending. I'll assign this a high weight because it suggests a propensity for criminal activity.\n\nNext, his physical attributes like height and weight don't seem directly relevant to the risk assessment beyond their symbolic meaning in some contexts. So, I'll consider them low or negligible in terms of risk.\n\nNow, let's think about his marital status and living situation. Living alone might suggest more autonomy and less supervision, but it could also indicate a higher potential for deviant behavior. Given this mix, I'll assign medium weight to this factor.\n\nHis educational background is another important aspect. With a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 2-year college, he has some education but not the highest level. This suggests limited social mobility and potentially more opportunities for criminal activity, so I'll give it a low weight.\n\nEmployment status is also crucial. Holding only one job during the year indicates unemployment or part-time work, which could mean financial instability and reduced access to resources that might otherwise deter crime. Therefore, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another significant factor. Using drugs in the past four years, particularly marijuana, and having experienced depression-like symptoms recently, suggests vulnerabilities that could lead to criminal behavior. Given this combination, I'll give it a high weight.\n\nLiving conditions as a child are also important. Growing up with a biological mother and living in a household of size 4 in an urban area might indicate exposure to poverty and crime, which could influence future behavior. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral guidance or empathy, which is likely to increase the risk of reoffending. Therefore, I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNow, let's sum up these weights and make a prediction:\n\n- Arrest record: 9/10\n- Physical attributes: 2/10\n- Marital status: 4/10\n- Educational background: 3/10\n- Employment status: 5/10\n- Substance use: 9/10\n- Living conditions as a child: 4/10\n- Belief in God's relevance: 8/10\n\nTotal weight: 46/100\n\nGiven these weights, I'll predict a high risk of reoffending.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"high\", \"The defendant has been arrested four times and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly impact the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate more autonomy but also less supervision, potentially increasing the risk of deviant behavior.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"low\", \"High school diploma with some education but no advanced degree suggests limited social mobility and potential opportunities for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year indicates unemployment or part-time work, which may lead to financial instability and reduced access to resources that might deter crime.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, including recent feelings of depression, suggest vulnerabilities that may increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions_as_child\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban household with a biological mother and possibly other siblings may have exposed the defendant to poverty and crime, potentially influencing future behavior.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"high\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral guidance or empathy, which could increase the risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 86\n}",
