    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He is White, stands at 5 feet 11 inches, weighs 160 lbs, lives alone without a spouse or children, holds a high school diploma, and has not enrolled in college. Additionally, he has used drugs in the past four years and has experienced feelings of depression. Let me think about each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The individual has been arrested twice and convicted. This indicates a pattern of criminal behavior that could be indicative of future offenses. I need to weigh this carefully. Given his two convictions, it seems like he has a significant track record of breaking the law. Therefore, I will assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, let's look at substance use. The individual has used drugs in the past four years and has recently experienced feelings of depression. Drug use can be a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially when combined with mental health issues. This factor seems quite significant. I will rate it as \"medium\" to reflect its importance but acknowledge that it's not as critical as the arrest history.\n\nLiving conditions are another factor to consider. The individual lives alone and has never been married. While living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might influence behavior, this factor alone doesn't seem strong enough to warrant a high weight. I will assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nEducation level is also important. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This suggests that he may lack higher education opportunities, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior. Therefore, I will rate this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held two jobs during the year. This indicates some level of work experience but also a lack of long-term employment stability. While it's not a strong predictor of future offenses, it does suggest instability in his life. I will assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nMental health is another consideration. The individual has experienced feelings of depression recently. Mental health issues can sometimes be linked to criminal behavior, but the link isn't direct or strong enough to warrant a high weight. I will rate this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nLastly, his biological mother's influence is an interesting factor. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when he was young. This could potentially shape his life and values, but it's not directly linked to future criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let me consider the prediction and confidence level based on these factors. Given the high arrest history and moderate drug use combined with mental health issues and living alone, I think there is a significant risk of rearrest recidivism. However, it's not certain, so I will assign a 60% confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior that could be indicative of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years and has recently experienced feelings of depression. While not directly linked to crime, drug use can sometimes be a factor in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"low\", \"Living alone is not necessarily indicative of increased risk of rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma without higher education opportunities may suggest some level of limited resources or access to educational opportunities, but this is not directly linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the year indicates some level of work experience, but also suggests instability in employment, which could potentially be a factor in future behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing feelings of depression can sometimes be linked to mental health issues, but this is not directly indicative of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
