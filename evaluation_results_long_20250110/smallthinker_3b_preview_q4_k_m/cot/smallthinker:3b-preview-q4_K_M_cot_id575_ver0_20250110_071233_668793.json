    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's address the arrest history. The person has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of criminal activity. However, since there's no conviction, we can consider this as low risk. Let me think about why I'm assigning 'low' here. It's because the lack of conviction suggests that the individual might be innocent or that legal proceedings are still ongoing.\n\nNext, let's look at age and gender. The person is 21 years old and identifies as White. These factors don't directly correlate with increased risk of recidivism based on statistical data, so I'll assign 'low' to both. This is a straightforward decision because there's no evidence suggesting that these factors are predictive of criminal behavior in this context.\n\nPhysical attributes such as height and weight also generally do not influence an individual's likelihood of being arrested or convicted. So, I'll assign 'low' to both aspects of physical attributes. It's important to remember that external factors like body size typically do not affect legal outcomes directly.\n\nMarital status is another factor. The person has never been married and is currently not living alone. This indicates some level of independence, which might be a positive factor in terms of stability. However, since the question focuses on recidivism, I'll assign 'low' to this factor as well. It's about the individual's current situation rather than potential future behavior.\n\nEducation is also important. The person has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This suggests a commitment to education and possibly a higher likelihood of not engaging in criminal activities. I'll assign 'medium' to this factor because it indicates some level of educational attainment but not necessarily a direct indicator of risk.\n\nWork history shows that the person has held four jobs during the year, which might suggest employability rather than increased risk. Therefore, I'll assign 'low' to this factor as well. It's about stability and economic well-being rather than criminal behavior.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. The individual has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. This indicates a stable lifestyle without substance abuse issues. I'll assign 'low' to this factor because it suggests that the person is unlikely to engage in illegal activities related to drug use.\n\nDepression history shows that the person has not felt depressed over the past month. This is also a positive factor, indicating mental health stability. Therefore, I'll assign 'low' to this factor as well. It's about overall psychological well-being rather than criminal behavior.\n\nLiving environment factors such as living with parents and having a household of size 5 are generally neutral or slightly positive for recidivism risk assessment. Since the focus is on current living situation, I'll assign 'low' to both aspects. These factors do not directly correlate with increased risk of recidivism based on statistical data.\n\nLastly, the belief in God might have some impact on personal beliefs and behaviors, but this factor is too vague and lacks direct correlation with recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll assign 'medium' to this factor. It's about psychological support systems rather than direct legal behavior.\n\nNow, let me summarize my findings:\n\n- Arrest history: low\n- Age (White): low\n- Physical attributes (height/weight): low\n- Marital status: low\n- Education (high school diploma, 2-year college): medium\n- Employment history (4 jobs in the year): low\n- Substance use (no drugs in past four years): low\n- Depression history (no depression over past month): low\n- Living environment (living with biological mother, household of size 5): low\n- Belief in God: medium\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll predict that the individual will not be rearrested within three years. My confidence level is 60%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"The lack of conviction suggests a low risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_white\", \"low\", \"There's no direct correlation between age and crime rate in this context.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes_height\", \"low\", \"Height does not influence legal outcomes directly.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes_weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not correlate with crime rate in this scenario.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_never_married\", \"low\", \"Marital status is generally neutral for recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"education_high_school_diploma_2-year_college\", \"medium\", \"Education indicates a stable lifestyle, suggesting low risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment_history_4_jobs_in_the_year\", \"low\", \"Multiple jobs indicate employability and stability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_no_drugs_in_past_four_years\", \"low\", \"No drug use is a positive factor for recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"depression_history_no_depression_over_past_month\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability is generally indicative of low risk of crime.\"),\n    (\"living_environment_living_with_biological_mother_household_of_size_5\", \"low\", \"Living situation is generally neutral or slightly positive for recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may have some impact on personal beliefs and behaviors, but it's too vague to directly correlate with recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
