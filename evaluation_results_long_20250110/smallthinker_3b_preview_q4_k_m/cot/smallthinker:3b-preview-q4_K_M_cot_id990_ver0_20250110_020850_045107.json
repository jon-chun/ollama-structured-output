    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I'll need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think through each factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age of 18. At this stage in life, there's a high potential for developmental instability and impulsivity. So, I'll assign \"high\" to the factor related to age.\nNext, she identifies as White. While racial identity can influence social perceptions and interactions, it doesn't directly contribute to her risk factors for criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll mark this as \"low\".\nHer height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight range between 175 and 199 lbs don't seem relevant to her criminal risk assessment, so \"low\" is appropriate.\nShe has never been married and lives alone, which might suggest a higher likelihood of substance abuse due to lack of social support. So, I'll assign \"medium\".\nHer enrollment in school at the present moment indicates she's currently engaged in education and not working, which could affect her financial stability but doesn't directly impact her criminal behavior. Thus, \"low\" for this factor.\nShe has held two jobs during the year, which suggests some level of employment and potentially a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So, \"medium\".\nHer past use of drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, is concerning as it may indicate substance abuse issues. Given that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, this factor seems to carry significant weight. Therefore, I'll assign \"high\".\nShe has never felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign for her mental health and potentially reduces the risk of criminal behavior.\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 at a young age, which might influence her socialization and exposure to substance abuse. So, I'll assign \"medium\".\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests a lack of moral or ethical guidance, which could increase the risk of criminal behavior. Therefore, \"high\".\n\nNow, let's compile these factors into a JSON object.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At age 18, there is a high potential for developmental instability and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"race_identity\", \"low\", \"While racial identity can influence social perceptions and interactions, it does not directly contribute to an individual's risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight do not seem relevant to the individual's risk factors for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may suggest a higher likelihood of substance abuse due to lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school at the present moment, indicating a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Has held two jobs during the year, suggesting some level of employment and potentially a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"Past use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning as it may indicate substance abuse issues.
