    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old White female who has been arrested seven times. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested seven times and convicted. This is quite alarming. Wait, let me think... Arrests are not just random incidents; they often indicate a pattern of behavior. Given this extensive record, it seems reasonable to assign a high weight to this factor. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\nNext, her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still a minor in many jurisdictions, but given her arrest history, this might not be directly relevant to the risk assessment. However, it's important to note that younger individuals may face more significant challenges in transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical characteristics and living situation. She is 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs, which seems within the normal range. Her living situation as currently alone also doesn't seem particularly significant in terms of risk factors. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nEducation and employment are next. She has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Additionally, she has held only one job during the year. These factors suggest a lack of educational attainment and limited work history, which could impact her future opportunities. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, and some time during the past month she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. These behaviors are indicative of substance abuse issues, which can be linked to higher risk behavior. So, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nTrauma history is also important. She has lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2 and considered the role of God in her personal life. This could suggest underlying emotional or psychological vulnerabilities. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nFinally, her overall risk level. Given the combination of arrest history, substance use, and limited educational attainment, it seems likely that she would be at high risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign a YES prediction with a 90% confidence level.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Given her seven arrests and convictions, this factor significantly increases her risk profile.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"While age is not directly relevant to risk assessment, it's important to note that she is a young adult who may face significant challenges in transitioning to adulthood.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Her physical characteristics are within the normal range and do not significantly impact her risk profile.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of educational attainment and limited work history suggest potential challenges in securing stable employment and achieving long-term stability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Repeated drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, indicates a pattern of substance abuse that could impact her future behavior.\"),\n    (\"trauma_history\", \"medium\", \"Experiences with substance abuse and perceived emotional vulnerability may indicate underlying psychological factors that influence risk behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
