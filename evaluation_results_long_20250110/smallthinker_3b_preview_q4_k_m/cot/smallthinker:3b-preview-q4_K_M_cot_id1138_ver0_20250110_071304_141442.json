    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has a variety of other characteristics. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the individual's demographic factors, such as age, race, and parental background. Wait, let me break this down further - what specific information do I have about these factors? The person is 20 years old, which means they are likely in their early adulthood stage with some level of maturity and potential for growth. They identify as Black, which could be relevant to the risk assessment due to various social and cultural factors. Additionally, they lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 when they were younger, which might indicate some form of family support or instability.\n\nLet me think about how to assign weights to these factors... For age and racial identity, I would say that while these are important factors, their direct impact on risk assessment might be somewhat moderate. So, for \"age\", I'd tentatively assign a weight of \"medium\". Similarly, for \"racial_identity\", I also see it as having a moderate influence, so another \"medium\" weight.\n\nNext, I need to consider the individual's personal characteristics and life events, such as employment status, substance use, and feelings of despair. Hmm... This is where things get interesting. The person has never held any jobs during the year, which suggests some level of unemployment or lack of stable employment. They have also used drugs in the past four years but not recently enough to be considered an immediate risk factor. Furthermore, they've experienced negative emotional states like feeling down for long periods.\n\nLet me check how these factors might impact the risk assessment... For \"employment_status\", I think it's reasonable to assign a weight of \"high\" because unemployment can indicate instability and potentially a lack of support system. Similarly, \"substance_use\" is also a significant factor, especially since they've used drugs in the past four years, so that would be another \"high\" weight.\n\nNow, what about the emotional state indicated by their feelings of despair? This seems like it could be somewhat low risk if considered individually, but let me think about how it fits into the overall picture... I'd say it's more indicative of mental health issues rather than direct criminal behavior, so perhaps a \"low\" weight would suffice for this factor.\n\nThe household situation when they were younger is also an important aspect. Living with both biological parents in a large household might suggest some form of support or possibly even instability. Wait a minute... This could be considered as having a moderate to high influence on their development and possibly on their current behavior, so I'd assign \"high\" for this factor.\n\nLastly, there's the statement about God potentially playing a role in their personal life. This seems somewhat vague and difficult to quantify directly into a risk assessment model. Let me consider how to approach this... Given its complexity and lack of specificity, I think it would be best to assign a relatively low weight for \"religious_beliefs\" or any perceived divine intervention.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors and their weights, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- The individual's age is moderately relevant.\n- Racial identity has a moderate influence.\n- Unemployment status significantly impacts risk assessment.\n- Substance use in the past four years is highly significant.\n- Feelings of despair are somewhat low risk when considered individually but may indicate underlying mental health issues.\n- Living with both biological parents as a child had a high impact on their development and possibly current behavior.\n- Religious beliefs or divine intervention have a relatively low weight due to their vagueness.\n\nGiven these considerations, the collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is... Let me think about this carefully. With all the factors taken into account, particularly the combination of unemployment, substance use, and potentially unstable upbringing, I believe it's reasonable to predict that there might be a higher risk. Therefore, my final answer would include a detailed explanation of each factor's weight and the collective prediction.\n\nHere is the refined response in JSON format as requested:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20-year-old male with some level of maturity but potentially unstable\"),\n    (\"racial_identity\", \"medium\", \"Black individual, may be influenced by social and cultural factors\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Never held any jobs during the year, indicates unemployment or instability\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Used drugs in the past four years, but not recently enough to indicate immediate risk\"),\n    (\"feelings_of_despair\", \"low\", \"Has felt down for long periods, but this may be indicative of mental health issues rather than direct criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"high\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5, potentially indicates instability or support system\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Statement about God having something to do with personal life is vague and difficult to quantify\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
