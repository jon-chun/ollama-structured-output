    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is 20 years old, which falls within the typical age range for criminal behavior studies. This makes it an important factor but not overly significant on its own.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n2. **Ethnicity**: The person identifies as White, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates due to societal factors and biases. This is a moderate factor.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **Arrest History**: He has been arrested 4 times, which indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. This is a significant factor.\n   - Weight: High\n\n4. **Conviction**: The individual has been convicted, which increases the likelihood of future offenses. This is also high.\n   - Weight: High\n\n5. **Marital Status**: He is currently living alone and has never been married. This suggests independence but does not significantly impact recidivism rates. It's a low factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Education Level**: With a high school diploma and no college enrollment, he has limited educational attainment. This might influence future opportunities but not directly the likelihood of rearrest. It's a moderate factor.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n7. **Job History**: He has held 5 jobs during the year, which indicates some level of employability. However, it does not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. It's a low factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n8. **Substance Use**: The individual has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, and felt down for the past month. This is a significant risk factor.\n   - Weight: High\n\n9. **Home Environment**: He lived with both biological parents and siblings in an urban household at a young age. This could influence behavior but is not directly linked to recidivism rates. It's a low factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n10. **God Belief**: The person does not consider God to be relevant to their personal life, which may indicate a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of moral guidance. This is a moderate factor.\n    - Weight: Medium\n\nNow, let's sum up the weights:\n- Low: 3\n- Medium: 3\n- High: 4\n\nTotal weight: 10\n\nGiven this analysis, I can confidently say that the individual has a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism. The prediction is \"YES.\"\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"20-year-old male falls within typical age range for criminal behavior studies.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"White ethnicity generally correlates with lower recidivism rates due to societal factors and biases.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"4 prior arrests suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, indicating increased likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Conviction\", \"high\", \"Convicted individual has higher risk of future offenses compared to those without convictions.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone and never married suggests independence but does not directly impact recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma with no college enrollment may influence future opportunities but not directly related to rearrest likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"5 jobs during the year suggest some level of employability, which is not necessarily linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and feelings of despair may indicate increased risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Home Environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents and siblings at a young age; does not directly impact recidivism rates but could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"God Belief\", \"medium\", \"Does not consider God relevant to personal life, which may lead to increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
