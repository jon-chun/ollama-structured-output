    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and assign weights based on their relevance and impact. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the potential risk factors that could influence the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. These factors include arrest history, age at first offense, education level, employment status, substance abuse history, family background, and personal beliefs. \n\nNow, let me break down each factor and assign a weight based on its relevance to this case.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested 1 time but not convicted. This is a significant factor since it indicates some level of criminal activity. Let me think... given the context, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n2. **Age at First Offense**: The person is 21 years old. This age range often correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to younger or older individuals. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n3. **Education Level**: The person does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. This lack of formal education could influence their ability to navigate the criminal justice system and secure employment post-release. Therefore, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n4. **Employment Status**: The person has held 2 jobs during the year. Employment history can be a strong indicator of rehabilitation potential. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n5. **Substance Abuse History**: The person has used drugs in the past four years but not recently enough to indicate frequent use. This could be a factor, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n6. **Family Background**: The person lived with his biological mother when young, which might suggest some support system. However, this is relatively less impactful, so I'll assign this a medium weight.\n7. **Personal Beliefs**: The person considers that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. This could indicate a strong moral compass or potential for redemption, making it a high weight.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given the medium-weight factors (arrest history, education level, employment status), and the low-weight factors (age at first offense, substance abuse history, family background), I'll predict that the person is likely to have a lower chance of rearrest.\n\nWait, let me check my reasoning again... Yes, it seems reasonable to assign a medium weight to these factors. The presence of an arrest but not a recent conviction, along with the lack of strong indicators for frequent substance abuse or significant family issues, suggests a moderate risk level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to one arrest without conviction\"),\n    (\"Age at First Offense\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as age is relatively high and not indicative of frequent criminal activity\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned for lack of formal education potentially impacting rehabilitation\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned for holding two jobs, suggesting some level of employability\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse History\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as substance use is not frequent and recent\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned for living with mother but lack of significant family issues\"),\n    (\"Personal Beliefs\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned for strong personal beliefs potentially influencing rehabilitation\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
