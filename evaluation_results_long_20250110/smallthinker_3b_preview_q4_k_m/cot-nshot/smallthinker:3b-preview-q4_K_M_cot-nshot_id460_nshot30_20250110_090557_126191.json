    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided in the question and assign a relative weight to each one. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the key elements of the case:\n- Age: 20 years old\n- Ethnicity: White\n- Arrest history: 1 time, not convicted\n- Current living situation: Not married, currently not living alone\n- Education: GED certificate, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: 4 jobs during the year\n- Substance use: Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years\n- Personal belief: Does not consider God's influence on life\n\nNow, let me break down each risk factor and assign a weight based on its potential impact:\n\n1. Arrest history:\n   - The person has been arrested once but was not convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the legal system.\n   - Weight: medium (there is a pattern, but no significant criminal record)\n\n2. Current living situation:\n   - Currently not married and not living alone. This might indicate instability or a lack of family support.\n   - Weight: low (not married, but stability seems moderate)\n\n3. Education level:\n   - Has a GED certificate, which indicates some educational attainment, but is not enrolled in college.\n   - Weight: medium (GED suggests basic education, but no further studies)\n\n4. Employment history:\n   - 4 jobs during the year shows significant employment activity, suggesting job-hopping and possibly instability.\n   - Weight: high (multiple jobs might indicate a struggle to find stable work)\n\n5. Substance use:\n   - Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, indicating a pattern of substance abuse.\n   - Weight: medium (recent use suggests ongoing involvement with substances)\n\n6. Personal belief:\n   - Does not consider God's influence on life, suggesting a lack of moral guidance or accountability.\n   - Weight: low (personal belief doesn't directly correlate to recidivism based on the data provided)\n\nLet me check if I have all the factors considered and then predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is my prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but was not convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"Current living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently not married and not living alone. This might indicate instability or a lack of family support.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"Has a GED certificate, which indicates some educational attainment, but is not enrolled in college.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"4 jobs during the year shows significant employment activity, suggesting job-hopping and possibly instability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, indicating a pattern of substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Personal belief\", \"low\", \"Does not consider God's influence on life. This might suggest a lack of moral guidance or accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on a careful analysis of the risk factors provided, considering both their individual impact and how they collectively predict the likelihood of rearrest recidivism over three years.",
