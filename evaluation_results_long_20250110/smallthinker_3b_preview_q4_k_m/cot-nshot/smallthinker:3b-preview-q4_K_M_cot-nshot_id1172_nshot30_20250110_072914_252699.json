    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully think through the risk factors one by one and assign a relative weight to each before using them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the age factor. At 19 years old, the individual is still in his late teens. This could mean that he might not have fully developed socially or emotionally yet. So, let me think about how significant this factor is. Wait a minute... I believe this factor has a medium weight.\n\nNext, the conviction history. The person has been convicted once already. This suggests some level of criminal behavior in the past. Let me check... Yes, this factor should have a high weight since convictions are typically taken very seriously.\n\nNow, substance abuse is another critical factor. The individual has used drugs in the past four years, which indicates ongoing involvement with substances. This factor should also have a high weight because substance use can often be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nMarital status is another aspect to consider. The person has never been married. Let me think about this... While being unmarried might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, it could indicate some level of personal freedom or independence that might affect decision-making. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nThe living situation also plays a role. The individual is currently living alone without a job. This suggests a lack of structured environment and potential financial instability. Let me consider... Yes, this factor should have a medium weight since it indicates some level of vulnerability or uncertainty.\n\nLastly, the belief in God. The person considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This shows a strong sense of spirituality or moral compass. Let me think about this... While this factor might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, it could influence decision-making. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's collect all these factors and their weights:\n\n1. Age (medium)\n2. Conviction history (high)\n3. Substance abuse (high)\n4. Marital status (low)\n5. Living situation (medium)\n6. Belief in God (medium)\n\nBased on these weights, I can now predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Given that the individual has a conviction history and is currently involved with substances, it's likely that he might be at risk of being rearrested again within three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"late teens\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"one previous conviction\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"used drugs in the past four years\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"currently unmarried\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"alone without a job\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"God has something to do with what happens to him personally\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
