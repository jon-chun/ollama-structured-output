    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the given case and assign a relative weight before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the risk factors based on the provided examples:\n\n- Arrest history (times convicted)\n- Age\n- Education level\n- Employment status\n- Family background\n- Attitude towards God\n\nNow, let's assign weights to each factor:\n\n1. Arrest history: The person has been arrested 1 time but not convicted. This is a mild offense and doesn't indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. Therefore, the weight for this factor is \"low\".\n2. Age: The person is 20 years old. Being young suggests potential vulnerabilities but also opportunities for growth. Thus, the weight for age is \"medium\".\n3. Education level: The person has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a basic education level, which might affect future opportunities. Therefore, the weight for education is \"low\".\n4. Employment status: The person has held 3 jobs during the year. This suggests some stability in employment but no significant gaps or long-term employment issues. Thus, the weight for employment is \"medium\".\n5. Family background: The person lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6 in an urban area. This might indicate a supportive environment, reducing the risk of criminal behavior. Therefore, the weight for family background is \"low\".\n6. Attitude towards God: The person considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This indicates independence and possibly lower reliance on societal norms. Thus, the weight for this factor is \"medium\".\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrest history (low): No significant criminal pattern.\n- Age (medium): Potential vulnerabilities but also opportunities.\n- Education level (low): Basic education might affect future prospects.\n- Employment status (medium): Stable employment with no significant gaps.\n- Family background (low): Supportive environment may reduce risk.\n- Attitude towards God (medium): Independence and lower reliance on societal norms.\n\nGiven these considerations, the collective prediction is that the person has a moderate to low likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. However, let's refine this:\n\n- Arrest history: Low\n- Age: Medium\n- Education level: Low\n- Employment status: Medium\n- Family background: Low\n- Attitude towards God: Medium\n\nAveraging these weights gives us a \"medium\" prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"attitude_towards_God\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
