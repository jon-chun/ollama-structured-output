    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested twice and convicted once, weighs 140 lbs., does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, is not enrolled in college, has held no jobs during the year, has used drugs only marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently, and grew up with his biological mother in an urban household. He also believes that God doesn't play a role in what happens to him.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I need to assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let's break it down one by one.\n\n1. **Multiple Arrests and Convictions**: This is a significant factor. The individual has been arrested twice and convicted once. This suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to further legal issues.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Unemployment**: Lack of employment history indicates instability in life, which can be a risk factor for reoffending.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **No Education/Training**: The absence of a high school diploma or GED certificate and no enrollment in college suggests a lack of social skills and education that might affect job prospects and personal relationships.\n   - Weight: High\n\n4. **Drug Use Only Marijuana**: While this is not ideal, it's less severe than other forms of substance abuse. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently is positive.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n5. **Lack of Godly Influence**: Believing that God doesn't play a role in his life might indicate a tendency towards antisocial behavior.\n   - Weight: High\n\n6. **Urban Household**: Growing up in an urban household can sometimes be challenging but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior unless other factors are present.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n7. **No Depression Recently**: This is a positive sign, as it suggests he's not currently experiencing severe emotional distress.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\nNow, let me combine these weights and their textual reasoning to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given the high scores for multiple arrests, unemployment, lack of education, and belief in Godlessness, along with a medium score for drug use and depression, I can see that the overall risk is quite high.\n\nWait, let me double-check the weights and their implications:\n- High: Multiple Arrests (High), Lack of Education/Training (High), Belief in Godlessness (High)\n- Medium: Unemployment (Medium), Drug Use Only Marijuana (Medium), No Depression Recently (Medium)\n\nConsidering all factors, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome is likely to be 'YES'.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Significant history of legal issues\"),\n    (\"Unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Limited economic stability\"),\n    (\"No Education/Training\", \"high\", \"Lack of social skills and education\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Only Marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Moderate substance use but no current depression\"),\n    (\"Belief in Godlessness\", \"high\", \"Negative influence on behavior\"),\n    (\"Urban Household\", \"low\", \"Typical household without significant crime exposure\"),\n    (\"No Depression Recently\", \"medium\", \"Positive sign of mental health\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
