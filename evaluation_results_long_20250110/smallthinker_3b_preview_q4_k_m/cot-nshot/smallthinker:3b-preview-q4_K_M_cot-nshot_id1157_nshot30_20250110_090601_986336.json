    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze each risk factor and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to it before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, I'll list out all the factors that could influence the prediction:\n\n1. Age\n2. Education level\n3. Employment status\n4. Substance use history\n5. Socioeconomic status\n6. Personal beliefs\n\nNow, let's assign a relative weight to each factor based on its potential impact on rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet me check the factors one by one:\n\n- **Age**: This is quite important as it reflects maturity and development. I'll give this a medium weight.\n- **Education level**: Education can be a strong predictor of success and stability, so I'll also assign a medium weight to this factor.\n- **Employment status**: Employment can significantly influence life choices and financial stability, so I'll give this a high weight.\n- **Substance use history**: Substance abuse is known to increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, so I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n- **Socioeconomic status**: Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to higher crime rates, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n- **Personal beliefs**: Beliefs can influence decision-making and resilience in challenging situations, so I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNow that I have the weights, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Given the high substance use history and medium socioeconomic status, along with other factors, it seems likely that this individual could face significant challenges in the future, increasing her risk of rearrest.\n\nLet me break down the reasoning:\n\n- The person is a young adult with some experience but no conviction.\n- Her education level is low, which could limit her job prospects and financial stability.\n- She has limited employment experience and uses substances frequently.\n- Socioeconomic status is medium, indicating potential challenges in life stability.\n- Personal beliefs suggest resilience but also a lack of structured guidance.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the collective risk suggests a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest. I'll assign a confidence level of 60%.\n\nNow, let's compile this into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may limit life choices and stability\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"Low education level may limit job prospects and financial stability\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Limited employment experience and potential for instability\"),\n    (\"Substance use history\", \"high\", \"Recent substance use increases risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Socioeconomic status\", \"medium\", \"Medium socioeconomic status may indicate potential challenges\"),\n    (\"Personal beliefs\", \"low\", \"Beliefs suggest resilience but also a lack of structured guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may limit life choices and stability\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"Low education level may limit job prospects and financial stability\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Limited employment experience and potential for instability\"),\n    (\"Substance use history\", \"high\", \"Recent substance use increases risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Socioeconomic status\", \"medium\", \"Medium socioeconomic status may indicate potential challenges\"),\n    (\"Personal beliefs\", \"low\", \"Beliefs suggest resilience but also a lack of structured guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
