    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully think through the process of analyzing the risk factors and assigning weights to them before predicting the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each risk factor means in the context of this particular case. Let's break down the case:\n\n- The person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White.\n- She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted.\n- Her height is between 5 feet 4 inches and 149 lbs, which doesn't directly affect recidivism but might be relevant for other factors like employment or living conditions.\n- She has never been married and lives alone.\n- She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college.\n- She has held 4 jobs during the year.\n- She uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the past month.\n- At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.\n- She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nNow, let me think about how each risk factor impacts the prediction:\n\n1. Age: The person is 21 years old, which is relatively young and might indicate impulsivity or a higher likelihood of reoffending. This could be considered medium weight.\n2. Arrests/Convictions: She has been arrested once and convicted, indicating a history of law-breaking. This should be high weight.\n3. Education Level: Having a high school diploma but not pursuing higher education might suggest limited future opportunities, which could be medium weight.\n4. Employment Status: Holding 4 jobs during the year suggests a busy lifestyle and possibly financial instability, which could be medium weight.\n5. Drug Use: Using drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years without feeling depressed indicates a potential substance abuse issue, which should be high weight.\n6. Living Situation: Living alone and not married might indicate independence but also potentially a lack of social support, which could be low to medium weight.\n7. Socioeconomic Status: Not having a college degree or pursuing higher education might suggest limited financial resources, which could be medium weight.\n8. Religious Beliefs: Considering that God has something to do with what happens to her personally might indicate a strong moral compass, which could be low weight.\n\nNow, let me combine these weights and think about the overall prediction:\n\n- Arrests/Convictions (high)\n- Drug Use (high)\n- Socioeconomic Status (medium)\n- Living Situation (low)\n\nThese factors suggest that there's a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism. The strong indicators of previous arrests and drug use, combined with socioeconomic challenges, make this case more likely to result in rearrest.\n\nLet me check the confidence level:\n\nGiven the significant number of high-weight risk factors and the limited protective factors, I would assign a 75% confidence level to this prediction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age may indicate impulsivity or higher likelihood of reoffending\"),\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"prior arrests and convictions suggest a history of law-breaking\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma but not pursuing higher education might indicate limited future opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"holding 4 jobs during the year suggests busy lifestyle and possibly financial instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"using drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years without feeling depressed indicates potential substance abuse issue\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"currently living alone but not married might indicate independence and lack of social support\"),\n    (\"socioeconomic_status\", \"medium\", \"not having a college degree or pursuing higher education might suggest limited financial resources\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"considering that God has something to do with what happens to her personally might indicate strong moral compass\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
