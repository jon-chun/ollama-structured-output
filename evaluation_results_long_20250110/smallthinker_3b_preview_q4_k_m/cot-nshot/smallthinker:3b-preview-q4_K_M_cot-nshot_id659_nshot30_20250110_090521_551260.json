    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the provided examples and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let's break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let me think about what we have here. We are given a set of n-shot examples with various risk factors and their corresponding outcomes. My task is to analyze these examples, assign weights to each factor, and then use those weighted factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for the new case.\n\nLet me check the instruction again. The key here is to understand how each risk factor contributes to the prediction of rearrest recidivism. This means I need to identify which factors are most influential in the context of these examples and assign weights accordingly.\n\nWait a minute... Let's start with the arrest history, as it seems to be a critical factor based on the examples provided. High arrest rates (3 or more) should definitely carry significant weight towards the prediction of rearrest recidivism. So, for this case, I'll assign \"high\" to the arrest history.\n\nNext, let me consider substance use. The examples show that individuals who have used drugs are likely to be at higher risk of rearrest recidivism. Since this person has used drugs in the past four years (1), I'll also assign \"high\" to the drug use factor.\n\nNow, let's look at employment status. Consistent or multiple job losses can indicate a lack of stable income and social support, which might increase the risk of rearrest recidivism. Given that this person has held only one job during the year (1), I'll assign \"medium\" to the employment status factor.\n\nEducation level is another important factor. Lower education levels may not directly contribute to rearrest recidivism but can affect other factors like substance use and unemployment. Since this person has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, I'll assign \"low\" to the education level factor.\n\nMarital status seems less relevant based on the examples provided. Given that the person is currently not living with anyone (2), I'll also assign \"low\" to the marital status factor.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. The high arrest history and drug use factors are clearly significant indicators of increased risk. While employment status and education level may not directly contribute as much, they could still play a role in other aspects that might influence the prediction.\n\nLet me check the instruction again. To predict 3-year rearrest recidivism, I need to consider all these factors together. Based on the analysis, I can confidently say that the high arrest history and drug use are strong predictors of increased risk. Therefore, my prediction for this case is \"YES\".\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level. Given the clear indicators of increased risk, with high weights assigned to arrest history and drug use, I'll assign a confidence level of 80.\n\nNow, let me put all this together in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested multiple times (3 or more), which is a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"The person has used drugs in the past four years, indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"The person has held only one job during the year, suggesting potential unemployment and social issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"The person has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which may not directly contribute to rearrest recidivism but could affect other factors.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"The person is currently not living with anyone, which may not significantly impact rearrest recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
