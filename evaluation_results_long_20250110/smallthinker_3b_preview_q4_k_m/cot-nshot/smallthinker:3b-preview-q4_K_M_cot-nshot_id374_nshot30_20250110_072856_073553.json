    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the potential risk factors and think about how they might influence the likelihood of rearrest:\n\n1. Age: The person is 22 years old.\n2. Arrest history: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted.\n3. Weight range: Between 150 and 174 lbs.\n4. Living situation: Currently living alone.\n5. Education level: Completed a Bachelor's degree and enrolled in a graduate program.\n6. Employment history: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n7. Drug use history: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n8. Parental involvement: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area.\n9. Belief in divine intervention: Considers God to be involved in life events.\n\nNow, let me think about how each factor might influence the likelihood of rearrest:\n\n1. Age: Being young (22 years old) might suggest impulsivity or a lower risk of recidivism due to ongoing education and development.\n2. Arrest history: One arrest without conviction could indicate a low risk of recidivism, as it may not reflect long-term behavior patterns.\n3. Weight range: The weight range doesn't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so it's likely to be low in terms of impact on recidivism.\n4. Living situation: Currently living alone might suggest independence and a lower likelihood of reoffending due to a support network.\n5. Education level: Completing a Bachelor's degree and being enrolled in graduate school indicates a high likelihood of future success, which should also reduce the risk of rearrest.\n6. Employment history: Holding 2 jobs during the year suggests stability and possibly a higher chance of maintaining law-abiding behavior.\n7. Drug use history: Using drugs (marijuana) might indicate substance abuse issues, which could be linked to a higher risk of recidivism.\n8. Parental involvement: Living with both biological parents in a larger household might suggest a support network that encourages positive behavior.\n9. Belief in divine intervention: Considering God's role in life events might not directly influence criminal behavior, so it should also be low in terms of impact on recidivism.\n\nLet me summarize the risk factors and their assigned weights:\n\n1. Age: medium\n2. Arrest history: low\n3. Weight range: low\n4. Living situation: high\n5. Education level: high\n6. Employment history: medium\n7. Drug use history: medium\n8. Parental involvement: high\n9. Belief in divine intervention: low\n\nNow, let's consider how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- The age factor is balanced by the education and employment history, both of which suggest a lower risk.\n- The arrest history is neutral.\n- The living situation and parental involvement indicate higher support that should reduce recidivism.\n- The drug use history suggests a moderate to high risk.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would predict a medium to high likelihood of rearrest recidivism. However, since the question asks for a binary prediction (YES or NO), and considering all factors, I will go with \"NO\" as the prediction.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age may suggest impulsivity but ongoing education reduces risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"one arrest without conviction indicates low recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight_range\", \"low\", \"no direct link to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"currently living alone suggests independence and lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"completed Bachelor's degree and enrolled in graduate program reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"held 2 jobs during the year indicates stability but moderate employment history\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"medium\", \"used drugs (marijuana) suggests potential substance abuse issues, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"parental_involvement\", \"high\", \"lived with both biological parents in a larger household suggests support network reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"belief_in_divine_intervention\", \"low\", \"considering God's role in life events does not directly influence criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
