    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task here to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for someone. The person in question is a 21-year-old male, identifies as White, has been arrested twice and convicted, is 5'11\" and weighs 160 lbs., never married, lives alone, has a high school diploma not enrolled in college, held two jobs during the year, used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), and at times felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. Also, he's been living with his biological mother in a household of size 4, and considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what constitutes high risk in this context. As a criminal justice risk assessment expert, I'm familiar with various factors that are considered when evaluating the likelihood of future offending behavior. These can include past convictions, frequency and type of criminal activity, substance abuse history, mental health issues, family background, and more.\n\nLet's break down each factor and see how it might impact the overall risk assessment.\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: Being a 21-year-old male could be relevant in some contexts, but generally, age isn't as strong a predictor of future criminal behavior as other factors like prior convictions or substance abuse. So, I'll keep this in mind but not prioritize it heavily.\n\n2. **Ethnicity**: Identifying as White might have some implications in certain jurisdictions, especially regarding bias in policing and prosecution. However, ethnicity alone is unlikely to be a significant risk factor without considering other variables.\n\n3. **Arrests and Convictions**: The person has been arrested twice and convicted once. This is a red flag. Each conviction increases the likelihood of future offenses, especially if they are related to similar crimes in the past. I need to consider the nature of these convictions as well, but without specific details, I'll have to assume they might be from different types of offenses.\n\n4. **Physical Appearance and Lifestyle**: Being 5'11\" and weighing 160 lbs., living alone, having a high school diploma, not enrolled in college, holding two jobs during the year, etc., don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless there's something specific about these factors that I'm missing. Maybe being employed full-time could be protective against certain types of crime, but overall, it's neutral.\n\n5. **Substance Abuse History**: Using drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, is concerning. Substance abuse can be a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, as it may impair judgment and lead to impulsive decisions that result in law violations. Additionally, the fact that he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up suggests possible mental health issues, which are also linked to higher risks.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Living with his biological mother in a household of size 4 at an early age could indicate some family dynamics. However, without knowing the specifics of these interactions or how they might have affected him, it's hard to say directly how this impacts risk assessment. Maybe there are lessons learned from being part of a larger family that could be relevant, but again, unclear.\n\n7. **Belief in God and Its Influence**: Considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is intriguing. In some cultures or belief systems, faith can provide support and guidance, which might have protective effects. However, in other contexts, it could be seen as enabling certain behaviors or providing justifications for actions. Given the limited information, I'll consider this neutral.\n\nNow, let's think about how these factors cumulatively impact the risk assessment.\n\n- **Prior Convictions**: One conviction is a serious concern, especially if it's not related to violent offenses but perhaps property crimes or drug-related offenses. Each prior offense increases the likelihood of future offending.\n\n- **Substance Abuse**: Drug use, particularly cocaine, which can have severe effects on mental health and judgment, is a significant risk factor. Cocaine addiction is known for leading to erratic behavior and impaired decision-making.\n\n- **Mental Health Issues**: The mention of feeling so down that nothing could cheer him up suggests possible depression or other mental health problems. Untreated mental illness can lead individuals to engage in criminal activities as a way to cope with their issues.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that this individual is
