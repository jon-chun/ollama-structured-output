    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 21 years old - This is relatively young.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - No significant indication of bias here.\n- Height and weight range: 5'5\" to 174 lbs - Average body size.\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college - Limited educational attainment.\n\nNext, let's look at the criminal history:\n- Arrested once and convicted - A single conviction does not necessarily indicate a high-risk profile.\n- Job history: Held only one job during the year - This could suggest instability or lack of commitment, but it doesn't clearly indicate risk.\n\nMoving on to substance use:\n- Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) - Past drug use is common and generally does not correlate with high risk unless there are additional factors.\n- No feelings of depression over the past month - This is a positive factor.\n\nSocial factors:\n- Never married, living alone currently - Living situation can be seen as unstable, but it's subjective.\n- Family history: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, urban area - Growing up in a larger family might indicate some resilience or different life experiences.\n- Belief in God and its influence on personal events - This belief system could potentially offer support networks.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The key here is to weigh the factors individually and collectively. While there are no significant red flags, such as multiple convictions or a history of violence, the combination of factors suggests a need for further scrutiny.\n\nWait a minute... Let's consider the context. The individual has been arrested once and convicted, which is a serious offense. However, she does not feel depressed and uses drugs infrequently. The family background is significant but might not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while there are no clear indicators of high risk, the single conviction and limited educational attainment suggest a need for closer monitoring. Additionally, the belief in God and her living situation add layers of complexity to her profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
