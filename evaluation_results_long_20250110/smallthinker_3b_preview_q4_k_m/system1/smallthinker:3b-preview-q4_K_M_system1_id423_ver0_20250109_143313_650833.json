    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's background. They are a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. This information alone doesn't seem alarming, but it might be relevant when evaluating certain aspects of their behavior. Wait, let me check if there are any other factors that could influence my assessment.\n\nThe fact that they have been arrested twice and convicted is a significant red flag. Being involved in the criminal justice system suggests a pattern of potentially problematic behavior. Let me think about this... If someone has a history of convictions, it often indicates a higher risk of reoffending. This should definitely be considered in my evaluation.\n\nTheir physical characteristics - 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 155 lbs - don't seem to directly impact their risk level unless there are specific medical or fitness factors at play that I'm not considering right now. For now, let's move on to other aspects of their life.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse or dependents might suggest some level of independence, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk in itself. However, the fact that they have never been married could imply a certain sense of personal freedom that, combined with their history of arrests, raises concerns about potential impulsivity or lack of social responsibility.\n\nTheir educational background is also noteworthy. Having never obtained a high school diploma or GED certificate, and not being enrolled in college now, suggests a limited formal education. This might impact their career prospects and financial stability, which could be factors in risk assessment. Let me consider this further... Limited education can indeed correlate with higher crime rates due to fewer job opportunities and potentially less access to resources.\n\nTheir employment history is another critical factor. Holding only 2 jobs during the year indicates a lack of consistency and possibly some instability. This volatility in employment could be linked to factors like personal issues, financial strain, or even criminal activity. Wait a minute... Could their current situation involve any of these factors? Given their multiple arrests, it's possible.\n\nThe fact that they have used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, is also concerning. Substance abuse can significantly influence an individual's behavior, including their likelihood of engaging in risky activities or committing crimes. Let me think about this... The use of both recreational and potentially illicit substances over a prolonged period does suggest a higher risk profile.\n\nFurthermore, their recent feelings of depression, characterized by feeling \"so down\" that nothing could cheer them up, are indicators of mental health issues. This is a crucial factor because untreated mental health problems can lead to impulsive actions and an increased risk of criminal behavior. I should consider how this might interact with the other factors.\n\nTheir past living situation with their biological father in a household of size 4 provides some context about their family dynamics, but it's not directly relevant to assessing their current risk level unless there are specific details that suggest ongoing issues or trauma.\n\nLastly, considering that they believe God has something to do with what happens to them personally might be an indicator of potential spiritual beliefs influencing their worldview. However, this alone doesn't seem to indicate a high risk profile without further context about how these beliefs impact their behavior or interactions with others.\n\nLet me summarize all these factors... Multiple arrests and convictions, limited education, unstable employment, substance abuse history, recent mental health issues, and personal beliefs about spirituality. These are all significant indicators of potential high risk.\n\nGiven the complexity of assessing risk based on multiple factors, I would conclude that yes, these risk factors do indicate a higher risk profile for this individual. The combination of their criminal history, limited education, unstable employment, substance abuse, recent mental health issues, and personal beliefs suggests a complex set of circumstances that could potentially lead to further risky behaviors.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is as follows:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
