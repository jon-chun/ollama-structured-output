    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for the individual in question. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's background and personal characteristics. He is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White, which is one of the many risk factors to keep in mind. Wait, let me break down his personal life - he has never been married and is currently living alone. This could be an important factor, as it might indicate some level of independence or lack of social support.\n\nNow, let's examine his educational background. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. This suggests that he is committed to education and possibly working towards a career. However, I should also consider the fact that he has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine). This could be a significant risk factor, as substance use can often lead to other negative outcomes.\n\nLet me think about his employment history - he has held 2 jobs during the year. While this might seem like a positive sign of stability and employability, I should also consider the possibility that frequent job-hopping could indicate underlying issues or difficulties in maintaining long-term relationships with employers.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. This information is crucial, as it provides insight into his family background and possibly his living environment during formative years. It's also worth noting that he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally - this could be an important factor in understanding his life choices and decisions.\n\nNow, let me weigh all these factors together. The combination of his age, educational status, substance use history, employment patterns, and personal beliefs seems to suggest a higher risk profile. Wait a minute... I think I'm starting to see a pattern here. Yes, after careful consideration, I believe that the risk factors indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, I would predict that yes, these risk factors do indicate high risk. And as for confidence level, given the complexity and interconnectedness of these factors, I would estimate it to be around 80%.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
