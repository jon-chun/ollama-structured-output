    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for a convicted male individual who identifies as Hispanic, is 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighs 240 lbs, does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, has never been married, currently lives alone, and has used drugs in the past four years. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll start by considering his conviction history - he's been convicted once before. This is definitely a significant factor, as it suggests that he may be prone to engaging in criminal behavior. Wait, let me check if there are any other factors that might influence my assessment... Yes, I also need to take into account his age, height, weight, and educational background.\n\nNow, let's break down the risk factors one by one. He's a 21-year-old male with Hispanic heritage - this doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own, but it does suggest that he may be part of a specific demographic group that is represented in the criminal justice system. His conviction history, however, raises some red flags.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone, which might suggest that he's independent or perhaps even reckless with his life - but I need to consider this in conjunction with other factors. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which could indicate limited education and possibly lower cognitive abilities... but again, this is not necessarily indicative of high risk on its own.\n\nThe fact that he's been using drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is also concerning - substance abuse can be a significant predictor of criminal behavior. And yet, it's important to note that his most recent drug use was four years ago, which suggests that he may have undergone some sort of recovery or rehabilitation.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area - this could potentially indicate some level of social and environmental risk factors. However, I also need to consider the fact that he now lives alone, which might suggest that he's matured out of certain behaviors or circumstances.\n\nFinally, his statement about God having something to do with what happens to him personally is... interesting. While it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk, it does suggest a strong sense of personal responsibility and possibly a desire for guidance or meaning in life. Wait a minute - this could be a crucial factor in assessing his potential recidivism risk.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together... Given the combination of his conviction history, substance abuse, limited education, and potentially fragile mental health, I'm starting to lean towards a \"YES\" answer for high risk. But I need to quantify my confidence level - this is where the 0-100 scale comes in.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that it's between 80% and 90% likely that he indicates high risk. This takes into account all of the individual factors and how they interact with one another.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
