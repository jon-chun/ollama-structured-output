    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given risk factors:\n- Age: 20 years old\n- Gender: Male\n- Ethnicity: White\n- Arrests: 1 time (not convicted)\n- Height: 6 feet 2 inches\n- Weight: 170 lbs\n- Marital Status: Never married\n- Living Situation: Currently not living alone\n- Education: GED certificate, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year\n- Substance Use: Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years\n- Mental Health: Not felt depressed over the past month\n- Family Background: Lived with biological mother (household size 4), urban area\n- Spiritual Belief: Does not consider God to be relevant for personal life\n\nNow, let's break down each factor and assess its relevance:\n\n1. Age: Being young can sometimes indicate impulsivity or lack of experience.\n2. Gender and Ethnicity: These factors alone do not significantly impact the risk level without additional context.\n3. Arrests: One arrest, not convicted, could suggest some level of antisocial behavior but is relatively minor.\n4. Physical Attributes: Height and weight are neutral in terms of criminal risk.\n5. Marital Status and Living Situation: These can be indicators of social stability or instability, which might slightly increase risk if there are issues with living conditions or family support.\n6. Education and Employment: Limited education and employment history might suggest a lack of stable financial situation or career direction, but this is not directly correlated to criminal activity.\n7. Substance Use: Using drugs in the past four years could be concerning, especially if it indicates substance abuse issues that might lead to violent behavior.\n8. Mental Health: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests relatively good mental health, which is a positive factor.\n9. Family Background: Living with a household of size 4 in an urban area might indicate some social influences, but this is not directly linked to criminal risk without more context.\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I'm covering all aspects. The key here is to balance the information and make a reasonable assessment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while there are several factors that could potentially increase risk, they do not collectively form a strong basis for predicting high-risk behavior based on the given data alone. Therefore, my conclusion is tempered by the need to avoid jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
