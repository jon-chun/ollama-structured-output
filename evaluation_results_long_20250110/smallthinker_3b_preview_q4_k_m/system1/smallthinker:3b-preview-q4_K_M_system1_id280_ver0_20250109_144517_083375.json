    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the list of risk factors: \n- The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.\n- He has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted.\n- His physical characteristics are height and weight.\n- His personal life includes being currently living alone, no high school diploma or GED certificate, no marriage, no job during the year, no drug use in the past four years, and no feeling of depression over the past month.\n- He lived with both biological parents at a young age in an urban household of size 4.\n- He believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me break this down. The fact that he's been arrested six times but not convicted is significant, although not directly indicative of high risk for future offenses since he hasn't been convicted. Wait, let me consider this further - the conviction status is important because it shows a pattern of behavior that may increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNext, his physical attributes don't seem to indicate any direct risk factors. Living alone without a partner could be seen as low-risk unless there are specific circumstances related to living alone that we're not considering here. Let me check - does being single or having a roommate typically correlate with higher risk? Not necessarily in this context.\n\nHis education level is also important. No high school diploma or GED certificate and no college enrollment might suggest a lack of structured learning environment, which could potentially be linked to higher risk factors. However, the absence of these indicators doesn't automatically mean he's at high risk; it just indicates a potential area for improvement.\n\nThe fact that he has not used drugs in the past four years is positive and suggests minimal substance-related risks. Similarly, his lack of depression over the past month is also positive.\n\nHis living situation with both biological parents as a young age could imply certain influences, but without more specific information on the nature of these relationships or their impact, it's hard to gauge risk here.\n\nLastly, his belief in God having something to do with personal experiences is an interesting factor. While this doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior, it could potentially indicate some level of moral compass or societal norms adherence, which might be relevant but requires careful consideration.\n\nLet me think about the overall picture... Given all these factors, while there are no clear indicators of high risk for future offenses or negative outcomes based on the provided information, it's also important to acknowledge that this assessment is limited by the data available. There could be other factors not mentioned here that might increase his risk level.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I would conclude that the given risk factors do not strongly suggest a high-risk profile. However, due to the complexity of human behavior and potential unseen circumstances, it's crucial to approach any decision with caution and consider additional information if available.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
