    "raw_message_text": "To answer this:\n\nLet me carefully analyze the risk factors for this 18-year-old female and determine if they indicate high risk. I'll break down each factor and consider its implications step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at her age and gender. Being an 18-year-old female does not inherently increase the risk of criminal behavior, as many young adults go through various challenges without resorting to crime. However, this factor alone doesn't significantly contribute to a high-risk assessment.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a concerning point, as it suggests she may have engaged in some form of illegal activity. Yet, the lack of conviction means that we cannot definitively conclude her involvement in criminal behavior based on this arrest alone.\n\nHer physical attributes are relatively unremarkable and don't seem to be contributing to any increased risk.\n\nRegarding her living situation, being currently single and living alone doesn't typically indicate a high-risk profile. However, it's worth noting that isolation can sometimes lead to vulnerability or desperation, which might indirectly influence behavior.\n\nEnrollment in school at the present moment is a positive factor, as education often leads to better opportunities and reduced likelihood of criminal activity. This supports the notion that she is focused on her future rather than engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\nHer employment history shows that she has held 3 jobs during the year. While this doesn't necessarily indicate any risk, it does suggest that she has experience with different work environments and may be adaptable.\n\nThe past four years of using drugs is a significant concern. Drug use can lead to various negative outcomes, including increased criminal activity. Additionally, her current feelings of despair suggest emotional instability, which could exacerbate behavioral risks.\n\nLiving with her biological dad in a household of size 4 in an urban area doesn't seem to provide any direct risk factors. However, it's important to note that living conditions can sometimes influence behavior, but this specific factor seems neutral.\n\nLastly, her belief in God having something to do with what happens to her personally is more related to her personal beliefs than a direct indicator of criminal activity.\n\nLet me think about this carefully... Considering all these factors together, I realize that while some of the risk factors are present, they don't collectively indicate a high-risk profile. The arrest without conviction and drug use are concerning, but given the other positive aspects such as education and adaptability, it's hard to conclusively label her as high-risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
