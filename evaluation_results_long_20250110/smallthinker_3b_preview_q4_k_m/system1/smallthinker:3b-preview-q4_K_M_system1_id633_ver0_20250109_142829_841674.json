    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and assess its impact on the overall risk profile of the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest record and convictions. Being arrested four times and having a conviction is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior. This suggests a pattern of engaging in illegal activities. I'll assign a high confidence level to this factor - 80%.\n\nNext, his age and physical attributes: being a 20-year-old male, 5 feet 9 inches tall, and weighing 180 lbs. These factors don't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's additional context that isn't provided here. I'll assign a moderate confidence level to this factor - 60%.\n\nHis criminal history is extensive, which is already accounted for in the arrest record. This reinforces the high-risk status. However, his lack of education and current living situation also need consideration.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone, which might suggest instability but doesn't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's a pattern of unstable relationships or criminal behavior related to this aspect. I'll assign a low confidence level to this factor - 40%.\n\nHis educational background is limited, lacking a high school diploma or GED certificate, and not enrolled in college. This could indicate difficulties in navigating the workforce and society due to lack of formal education. I'll also assign a moderate confidence level to this factor - 60%.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which might suggest instability but doesn't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's a pattern of unemployment or criminal activity related to employment. I'll assign a low confidence level to this factor - 40%.\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, and recently felt severely depressed without any apparent reason. This combination suggests a high risk for substance abuse and potential mental health issues. I'll assign a very high confidence level to this factor - 90%.\n\nLastly, his history of living with both biological parents in a household of size six in an urban area might suggest some level of social adversity but doesn't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's a pattern of adverse childhood experiences. I'll assign a moderate confidence level to this factor - 60%.\n\nAnd finally, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally could be seen as a coping mechanism or a reflection of personal beliefs but doesn't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's evidence of religious extremism or spiritual manipulation. I'll assign a low confidence level to this factor - 40%.\n\nNow, let me summarize the overall confidence levels for each factor and determine the final prediction.\n\n- Arrest record: 80%\n- Age and physical attributes: 60%\n- Criminal history (already covered): 80%\n- Lack of education: 60%\n- Current living situation: 40%\n- Job stability: 40%\n- Substance use: 90%\n- Adverse childhood experiences: 60%\n- Religious beliefs: 40%\n\nGiven that several factors, especially substance use and lack of education, indicate a high risk profile, I can confidently predict that this individual is at a high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
