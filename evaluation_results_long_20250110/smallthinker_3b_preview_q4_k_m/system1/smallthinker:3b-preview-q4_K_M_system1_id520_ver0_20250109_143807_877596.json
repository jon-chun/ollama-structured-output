    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key pieces of information: the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Her physical attributes include being 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing between 125 and 149 lbs. These details seem relatively benign on their own, so let me focus on other factors.\n\nThe person has never been married, is currently living alone, holds a high school diploma, and hasn't enrolled in college. She's had 4 jobs in the past year and has used drugs - specifically marijuana and cocaine - in the last four years. This could be concerning, but it's also important to consider that many individuals experience substance use during these periods without resorting to crime or other high-risk behaviors.\n\nWait a minute... another crucial aspect is her background. She lived with her biological mother in a household of six when she was younger, which suggests some formative experiences that might influence her behavior. Additionally, she considers God's involvement in her personal life, which indicates a strong belief system that could potentially guide her decisions and actions.\n\nLet me break down the risk factors further:\n- Arrested but not convicted: This is concerning, as it shows potential antisocial tendencies.\n- Drug use history: While not necessarily indicative of high crime propensity alone, it's a significant factor to consider.\n- Living with multiple people in childhood: Could indicate family instability or trauma that might affect behavior later on.\n- Strong religious beliefs: Might suggest a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nConsidering these factors, I need to weigh the potential risks against more neutral aspects like education and living situation. It seems the arrest history is the most concerning factor among the given data points.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively indicate risk. The combination of arrested status, drug use, and family background does suggest a potentially higher likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that the given risk factors do indeed indicate high risk.\n\nHere's my analysis summarized in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
