    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they indicate high risk for the individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. They are an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. This is a good starting point, but it doesn't necessarily indicate any specific risk factors. Wait, let me check if there's anything else in their background that could be relevant... \n\nOkay, so they have been arrested once and convicted, which could potentially suggest some level of antisocial behavior or risk-taking tendencies. Let me think about this for a moment... A single conviction might not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior, but it does raise some red flags. I'll need to consider other factors as well.\n\nNext, I'll look at their physical attributes and personal life. They are 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 210 lbs, which seems like a typical height and weight range for an adult male. Let me check if there's anything unusual about this... \n\nHmm, nothing stands out immediately. However, the fact that they are currently living alone and have never been married does suggest some level of independence, but it doesn't necessarily indicate any risk factors.\n\nNow, let's move on to their employment history. They have held only one job during the year, which could potentially indicate some level of instability or difficulty in maintaining steady employment. Wait a minute... This could be relevant if they are able to secure and maintain jobs consistently, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any high-risk behavior.\n\nMoving on to their substance use history, they have used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and have not felt depressed over the past month. Let me think about this... While using drugs can be a risk factor for some individuals, it's also important to consider that many people use these substances without developing any significant issues.\n\nIn addition to their substance use history, I'll also consider their living situation and life events. They have lived with their biological mother in a household of size 2 while young, which could potentially suggest some level of instability or difficulty in maintaining stable relationships. However, let me check if this is still relevant given that they are now living alone... \n\nYes, it's interesting to note that they have not had any significant life events in the past year that might raise concerns about risk factors. But I'll need to consider other aspects as well.\n\nFinally, I'll look at their personal beliefs and values. They do not believe that God has anything to do with what happens to them personally, which could potentially suggest a lack of spiritual or moral guidance. Let me think about this for a moment... While this doesn't necessarily indicate high-risk behavior, it's worth considering in the context of their overall profile.\n\nNow, let me take all these factors into account and try to determine if they indicate high risk. Hmm... After careful consideration, I'm still not entirely convinced that these factors collectively suggest high-risk behavior. However, given the lack of significant negative indicators, I'll need to make a decision based on the available information.\n\nAfter weighing all the evidence, my conclusion is that while there are some potential red flags, they do not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior. Therefore, my prediction would be \"NO\", indicating low risk.\n\nMy confidence level in this assessment is 60%, as I have considered multiple factors and weighed their relative importance. However, it's essential to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and a more thorough evaluation of the person's specific situation might yield different results.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
