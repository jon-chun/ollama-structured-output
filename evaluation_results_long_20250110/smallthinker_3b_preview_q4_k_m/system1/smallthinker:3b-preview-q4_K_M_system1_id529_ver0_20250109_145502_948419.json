    "raw_message_text": "To answer this:\n\nLet me analyze these risk factors carefully. I need to determine if they indicate high risk for the individual in question.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor indicating potential recidivism. However, let me think... Recidivism doesn't always mean repeat offenses; it could also reflect a pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed.\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 19 years old and male might suggest impulsivity or other characteristics, but these are general and not specific indicators of high risk in this context.\n\nHis physical attributes, such as height and weight, seem normal for an individual without any known health issues. This doesn't contribute to a high-risk assessment directly.\n\nEducation and employment history are also important. The fact that he has never been married, lives alone, and does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate suggests a certain level of independence but also potentially higher levels of personal responsibility for his life circumstances.\n\nHis lack of drug use in the past four years and absence of depressive symptoms over the past month are positive indicators. However, let me check... These factors alone do not necessarily indicate low risk; they could still be part of a broader picture that needs evaluation.\n\nThe mention of living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 at a young age introduces potential social or environmental factors that might have influenced him. This is an important point to consider, as it could suggest exposure to certain behaviors or environments that may contribute to higher risk levels.\n\nLastly, the belief in God having something to do with personal experiences indicates a strong sense of spirituality and possibly moral values. While this can be a positive factor, indicating a potential for adherence to societal norms, it does not directly correlate with high-risk behavior.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Criminal history: High risk indicator\n- Age and gender: Neutral or low risk\n- Physical attributes: Normal\n- Education and employment: Moderate risk\n- Drug use and mental health: Low risk\n- Social background: Potential moderate risk factor\n- Spirituality: Positive but not directly correlated with high-risk behavior\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that while there are some factors that could indicate higher risk, they do not necessarily suggest a high-risk profile. Therefore, my prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
