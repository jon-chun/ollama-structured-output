    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background. She is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as mixed race. This doesn't immediately raise any red flags for me. Wait, let me check the other factors before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe next piece of information is that she has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. This is definitely a significant factor in determining high risk. Let me think about how this affects my overall assessment... Ah, yes! The fact that she's had multiple arrests and convictions suggests that she may be prone to engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes: 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 139 lbs. Hmm... these characteristics don't seem relevant to risk assessment, so I'll move on.\n\nShe is divorced and lives alone, which might suggest some level of instability or vulnerability. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate high risk in itself. Let me think about other factors... Ah, yes! She has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. This could be seen as a lack of education or motivation for further learning.\n\nShe also holds 2 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of employment stability. And, interestingly, she hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. This is a positive factor that reduces her risk profile.\n\nNow, let's consider her childhood experiences: she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 at an early age. While this may not directly impact her current risk level, it does provide some context for her background and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nFinally, she believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This... doesn't seem relevant to risk assessment either. Let me think about how I can incorporate this into my analysis... Ah, yes! It's possible that this belief may influence her decision-making or behavior in some way, but it's not a clear indicator of high risk.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I'm starting to form an opinion on the person's risk level. Wait a minute... let me summarize my thoughts so far. We have multiple arrests and convictions, no drug use for four years, divorced status, and certain personal beliefs. These factors suggest a moderate level of risk.\n\nBut what about confidence in this assessment? Let me think about how I can quantify the likelihood that these factors indicate high risk... Ah, yes! Based on my analysis, I would say that there's approximately 60% confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n\nNow, let me put all my thoughts together into a clear and concise answer. Here it is:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
