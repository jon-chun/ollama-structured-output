    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate high risk for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors one by one and think about their implications.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested 5 times and convicted. This is a significant number of offenses, which suggests a pattern of involvement in legal issues. I'll assign this a high risk score.\n\nNext, his demographic information includes being male, Black, 22 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighing 165 lbs. These factors alone do not indicate high risk, but they can be considered alongside other factors.\n\nMoving on to his criminal history again, the fact that he has never been married and is currently not living alone might suggest a lack of stable social support or perhaps an inclination towards independence. However, this does not necessarily correlate with increased risk in a direct manner.\n\nNow, let's look at his educational background. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lower level of education and potentially fewer opportunities for upward mobility. I'll assign this a moderate to high risk score based on this factor alone.\n\nHis employment history indicates that he has held 3 jobs during the year, which could suggest instability or difficulty finding long-term employment. This is another factor that points towards higher risk.\n\nRegarding his substance use, he has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. This could be a significant risk factor, depending on how it impacts his behavior and decision-making. I'll assign this a moderate risk score.\n\nHis mental health status shows that he has not felt depressed over the past month. This is a positive sign and suggests that at least in recent times, he has been coping well with depression. However, without more context or history, I won't assign this a high risk score.\n\nLastly, his early life experiences include living with his biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. While this is interesting, it does not directly correlate to increased risk unless there are specific factors related to urban upbringing that contribute to higher risk. For now, I'll consider this as having no direct impact on the current high-risk status.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally indicates a strong sense of faith and possibly a greater focus on moral values or destiny. This could mitigate some risks but does not directly indicate high risk in terms of criminal behavior or substance use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I can see that the individual's history of arrests and convictions, combined with his lower educational attainment and employment instability, strongly suggest a higher risk profile. However, the other factors like education, employment, mental health, and personal beliefs do provide some mitigating factors.\n\nLet me summarize my findings:\n- High criminal history\n- Moderate to high educational attainment\n- Low mental health risk\n- No direct impact from early life experiences\n- Lower sense of faith-related risk mitigation\n\nGiven these considerations, I will predict a moderate to high risk profile for this individual. The confidence level will be 70%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
