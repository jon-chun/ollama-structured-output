    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for this individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the fact that she is a 19-year-old female who has been arrested multiple times and convicted. This suggests a pattern of non-compliance with the law, which could be a significant factor in determining her risk level. Wait, let me break it down further - what does it mean to have been arrested 5 times? It means she has a history of committing crimes, which is a clear indication of behavioral issues.\n\nNext, I need to think about her background and how it might influence her behavior. She is married, currently living with her spouse, but hasn't held any jobs in the past year. This lack of employment and recent marital instability could be important factors. Let me check if there's anything else... Ah yes, she has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive aspect.\n\nHowever, some periods during the past month, she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This emotional state might indicate underlying mental health issues or difficulties in coping with life events. I should also consider her education level - without a high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college. This lack of formal education could limit her opportunities for employment and further education, potentially contributing to her current situation.\n\nNow, let's think about the living environment she grew up in. She lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, which is an urban area. While this information might not directly impact her risk level, it does give insight into her family structure and socioeconomic background. And then there's her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally - this could be seen as a positive aspect, potentially indicating a strong moral compass or resilience.\n\nLet me weigh these factors... The combination of her arrest history, lack of jobs, emotional state, low education level, and recent life changes does suggest significant risk. But I need to quantify this into a confidence score. Considering all the factors mentioned, with some weighing more heavily than others, I would say there's approximately 85% confidence in labeling this as high risk.\n\nSo, after carefully analyzing the given risk factors and considering their implications, my conclusion is that yes, these factors indicate a high level of risk. Therefore, my response should be:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
