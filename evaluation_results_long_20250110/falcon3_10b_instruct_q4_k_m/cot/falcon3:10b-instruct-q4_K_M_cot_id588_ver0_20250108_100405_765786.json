He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area.
