The individual's age (20), gender, and ethnicity are not traditionally associated with high crime rates. Her criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which suggests a lack of persistent criminal behavior. She has never been married and does not live alone, indicating potential stability in her personal life. Her education level (high school diploma and college enrollment) and employment history (holding 3 jobs within the year) suggest involvement in productive activities. The absence of depression and drug use in the past month further reduces her risk profile. While living with a single parent in an urban area during childhood could potentially introduce some risk, it is not sufficient to elevate her risk profile significantly given her overall stable circumstances. Her religious belief also suggests potential for moral or ethical constraints on behavior. Therefore, despite the presence of some risk factors, the overall picture suggests a low-risk individual.",
