While the individual has used drugs in the past, there is no recent use or indication of depression. He has a stable living situation and employment history. His age, gender, and ethnicity do not significantly contribute to risk assessment without additional context. The single arrest without conviction suggests a lack of persistent criminal behavior. However, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided.",
