His educational background and current enrollment in college suggest potential for stability. While having two prior arrests and convictions is concerning, the lack of recent drug use and limited employment history during the year may indicate less severe offenses or situational factors. The absence of a spouse or family dependents could also suggest fewer commitments that might lead to criminal behavior. The individual's residential history in an urban area, living alone, and his religious beliefs do not significantly contribute to high-risk indicators. However, the period of prolonged sadness may be a factor worth monitoring for potential mental health concerns. Overall, given the information provided, this individual is assessed as having a moderate risk level.",
