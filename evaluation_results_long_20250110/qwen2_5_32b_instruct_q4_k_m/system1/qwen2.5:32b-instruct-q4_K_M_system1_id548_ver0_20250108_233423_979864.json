Factors such as being enrolled in school, having held multiple jobs, living alone (which can be seen both ways but here seems to point towards independence), and the religious sentiment suggest some degree of social integration and stability that are typically associated with lower risk. However, factors like drug use and past arrest do increase risk somewhat, which is why confidence is not higher. The mental health aspect indicates a need for support but does not in itself suggest high criminal risk without more concrete indicators of antisocial behavior or violence.",
