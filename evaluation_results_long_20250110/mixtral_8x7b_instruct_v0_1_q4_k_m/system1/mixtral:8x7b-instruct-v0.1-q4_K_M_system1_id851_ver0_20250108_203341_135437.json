The lack of employment in the past year could be concerning, but there may be valid reasons for this which are not specified. Overall, while some caution is advised, I would assess this individual as having a relatively low to moderate risk based on these factors alone. However, it's important to note that any risk assessment should consider all available information and factors, and be regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes available or circumstances change.",
