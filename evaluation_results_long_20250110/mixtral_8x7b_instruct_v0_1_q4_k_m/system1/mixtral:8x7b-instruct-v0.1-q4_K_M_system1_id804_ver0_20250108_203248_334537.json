Factors contributing to this assessment include: multiple arrests and convictions, history of living alone, lack of higher education, inconsistent employment history, and reported symptoms of depression. However, some protective factors include the absence of drug use in recent years and a belief in divine intervention. It's crucial to consider that a single risk assessment cannot fully capture an individual's potential for recidivism or positive growth, and ongoing monitoring and support are key components of effective risk management.",
