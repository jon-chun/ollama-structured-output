The person has only been arrested once and hasn't been convicted, indicating no criminal history of significance. The subject's age, race, and gender are neutral factors in the assessment. Although marijuana use is illegal and can be considered a risk factor, it is less severe than other types of drug use.\n\nHowever, there are some risk factors to consider: low educational attainment, limited employment history, and living without both parents as a child. These factors could indicate challenges with stability and self-sufficiency. However, the absence of depression, past criminal convictions, and current living arrangements suggest that she has social support and is not currently experiencing significant psychological distress, which reduces her risk level.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, there is a low to moderate risk associated with the individual, but it's important to note that additional factors could increase or decrease the risk level. This assessment should be viewed as preliminary and subject to further investigation and evaluation.",
