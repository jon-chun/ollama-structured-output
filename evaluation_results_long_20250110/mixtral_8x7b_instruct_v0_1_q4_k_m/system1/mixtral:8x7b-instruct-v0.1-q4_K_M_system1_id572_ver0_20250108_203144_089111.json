These include having a high school diploma, not currently feeling depressed, growing up in a stable two-parent household, and holding religious beliefs. Overall, the absence of more severe risk factors such as violent offenses or mental health issues suggests a relatively lower level of risk, but further assessment may be necessary to confirm this.",
