Additionally, his past drug use contributes to the risk assessment. While no recent signs of depression have been reported, this does not necessarily reduce the overall risk level. The subject's living situation and belief in divine intervention may also suggest instability or disconnection from community resources that could support positive life changes. However, it is essential to understand that a risk assessment cannot guarantee future behavior, and it should be used as one tool among many when making decisions within the criminal justice system.",
