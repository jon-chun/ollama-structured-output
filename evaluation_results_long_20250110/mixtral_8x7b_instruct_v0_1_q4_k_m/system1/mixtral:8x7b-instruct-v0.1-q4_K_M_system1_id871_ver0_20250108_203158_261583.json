In this case, the individual's history of multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and symptoms of depression may indicate higher risk. Other factors that might contribute to her risk level include her young age at first arrest, living alone, and not having a strong religious belief. However, I cannot rule out the possibility that she might have mitigating circumstances or personal qualities that would reduce her risk level.",
