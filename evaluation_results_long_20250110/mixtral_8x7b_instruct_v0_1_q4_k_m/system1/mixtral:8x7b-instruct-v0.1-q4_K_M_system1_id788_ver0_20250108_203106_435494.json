These include being a young male, having prior arrests and convictions, history of drug use, unstable employment, and symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that these factors do not guarantee criminal behavior and should be considered as part of a comprehensive assessment. The confidence level is set at 75% due to the presence of multiple risk factors but also taking into account individual circumstances that could mitigate these risks.",
