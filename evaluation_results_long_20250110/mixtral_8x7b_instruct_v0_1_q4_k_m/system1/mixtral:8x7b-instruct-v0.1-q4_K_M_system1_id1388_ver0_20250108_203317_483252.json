These include:\n1) History of prior arrests and convictions\n2) Size and weight (while these factors alone do not necessarily indicate risk, they can contribute to an overall assessment when combined with other elements)\n3) Lack of education and employment stability\n4) Substance abuse history\n5) Possible mental health concerns (\"she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\")\nHowever, it's important to note that protective factors (such as having a support system or strong religious beliefs) can mitigate some of these risks. A comprehensive assessment should be conducted by a qualified professional to determine the overall risk level.",
