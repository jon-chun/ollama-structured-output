Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
