Age (21) and gender (male) are not significant indicators of crime on their own.\n2. Low arrest frequency (1 time) and recent conviction.\n3. Employment history (1 job held in the year).\n4. Educational background (GED certificate and currently enrolled in a 4-year college).\n5. Living situation (living alone, not married), which may indicate stability.\n6. Drug use is not recent or frequent enough to be a significant risk factor.\n7. Mental health indicator (feeling down) is not severe or ongoing enough to be a major concern.\n8. Childhood and family background do not suggest instability or exposure to crime.\n9. Religious beliefs are non-traditional but not indicative of criminal behavior.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because some risk factors, such as drug use and feelings of depression, could potentially increase risk if more severe or frequent. However, based on the available information, these factors do not indicate a high risk for recidivism.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
