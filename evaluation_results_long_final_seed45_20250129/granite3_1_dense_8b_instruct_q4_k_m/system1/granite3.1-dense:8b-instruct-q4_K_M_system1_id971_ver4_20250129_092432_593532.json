Living alone, not being married, and having a GED certificate rather than a high school diploma also increase the risk. The fact that he has only held one job in the year suggests potential instability. His urban upbringing in a small household with his biological mother could indicate a lack of stable family support. Lastly, his disbelief in a higher power might suggest less internalized moral or ethical standards, which can be a risk factor for criminal behavior. While there are some mitigating factors (like being enrolled in college), the combination and severity of these risk factors justify a high-risk assessment.",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
