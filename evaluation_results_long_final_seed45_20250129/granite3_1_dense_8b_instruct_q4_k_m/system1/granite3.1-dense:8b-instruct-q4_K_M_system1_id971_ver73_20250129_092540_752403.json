In this case, the individual's history of criminal activity (arrest and conviction), recent drug use, occasional feelings of depression, and single-parent household upbringing are significant risk factors. The fact that he is a young male with limited employment history and educational background also increases his risk level. While some factors like race and current living situation may not be as strong indicators of recidivism, the combination of these factors still suggests a high level of risk for future criminal behavior. Therefore, I predict that this individual is at high risk with a confidence level of 75%.",
