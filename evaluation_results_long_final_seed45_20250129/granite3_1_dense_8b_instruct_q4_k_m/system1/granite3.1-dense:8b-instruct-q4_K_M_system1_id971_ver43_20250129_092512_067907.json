Prior arrest and conviction\n3. History of drug use (marijuana)\n4. Current feelings of depression (so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up)\n5. Living alone, which may suggest a lack of social support\n6. Single marital status, which can be associated with higher risk behaviors\n7. Living with biological mother in an urban area during childhood, which may indicate exposure to certain environmental risks.\n\nThe other factors such as race, height, weight, education level (GED certificate and college enrollment), employment history, and religious beliefs do not significantly contribute to a high-risk assessment based on typical criminal justice risk assessment criteria. The confidence is set at 65 due to the presence of several risk factors.",
