    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided do not indicate a high risk for recidivism. While the individual has been arrested and convicted, his age (21), gender (male), marital status (never married), and current living situation (alone) are not typically associated with high risk. His GED certificate and enrollment in college suggest a level of education and future orientation that can be protective factors against criminal behavior. The fact that he has held only one job during the year could be a concern, but it does not outweigh the positive aspects of his profile.\n\nHis drug use is a risk factor, particularly the recent use (past month), but it is not severe or chronic. His current depression symptoms are concerning, as they suggest emotional distress that may increase his risk for future criminal behavior if left untreated. However, these factors alone do not elevate him to a high-risk category based on the typical criteria used in actuarial risk assessments.\n\nHis biographical history, including growing up in an urban area with his mother and siblings, does not suggest a background of violence or criminality. His lack of religious belief is not a significant predictor of crime.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, they do not reach the threshold for a high-risk classification based on standard actuarial tools and research. The model would predict a moderate to low risk level, with a confidence score of approximately 65%.",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
