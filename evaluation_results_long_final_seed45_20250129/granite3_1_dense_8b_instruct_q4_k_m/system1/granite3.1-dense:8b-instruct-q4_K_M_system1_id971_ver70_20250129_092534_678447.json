His arrest history includes only one prior arrest, and he has been convicted once, which is relatively low compared to individuals with multiple convictions or recidivism rates. He is single, living alone, and enrolled in college, both of which are indicative of stable behavior patterns. His employment history shows a recent job hold, which is positive. His drug use is limited to marijuana and not ongoing or heavy, and his depressive symptoms are not chronic but rather situational, occurring \"some of the time\" in the past month. He comes from a small household with his mother during childhood, which could indicate a more stable upbringing. His religious beliefs (or lack thereof) do not suggest an inclination towards violent or criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the absence of factors typically associated with high-risk individuals such as a history of violence, chronic substance abuse, family history of crime, or unstable living conditions.",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
