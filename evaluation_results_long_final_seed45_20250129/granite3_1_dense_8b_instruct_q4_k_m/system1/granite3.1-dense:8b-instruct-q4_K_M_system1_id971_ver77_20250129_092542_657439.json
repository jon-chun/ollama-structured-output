His young age, single living status, and limited employment history also suggest increased vulnerability. Living in an urban area as a child and his non-religious beliefs may not directly impact risk but are included for a comprehensive assessment. The combination of these factors leads to a high-risk prediction with moderate confidence due to the absence of more severe indicators like violent offenses or extensive substance abuse history.",
