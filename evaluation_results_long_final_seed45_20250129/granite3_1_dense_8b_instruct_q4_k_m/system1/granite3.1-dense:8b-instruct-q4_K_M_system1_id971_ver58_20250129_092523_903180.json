The individual's age, gender, marital status, education level (GED and college enrollment), employment history, and current living situation do not present significant risks on their own. The fact that he has never been married and lives alone is also not indicative of high risk.\n\nThe past conviction suggests a minor criminal history, which is less concerning than multiple arrests or convictions. His drug use is limited to marijuana and occurred mostly in the distant past, with some recent use but not consistently. The depressive symptoms are concerning, but without additional context (e.g., treatment, severity) it's difficult to assess their risk level.\n\nThe individual's upbringing and current circumstances do not suggest significant exposure to high-risk environments or factors. Living alone in an urban area does not necessarily indicate risk. His religious beliefs (or lack thereof) are not a predictive factor for criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk appears moderate rather than high. The confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information available about the individual's mental health status and the severity of his past offenses.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
