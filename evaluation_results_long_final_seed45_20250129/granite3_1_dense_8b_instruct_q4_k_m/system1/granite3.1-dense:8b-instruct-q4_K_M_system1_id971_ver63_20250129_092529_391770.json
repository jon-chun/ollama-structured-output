    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided indicate a moderate level of risk rather than high risk. The individual is young (21), male, and has had only one prior arrest and conviction, which are generally associated with lower risk levels. He is enrolled in college and holds a job, suggesting some stability and motivation for personal growth. His drug use is limited to marijuana, which is less severe than other illicit substances.\n\nHowever, there are some factors that suggest potential risk. The individual occasionally experiences feelings of profound sadness (depression), which could be a precursor to further antisocial behavior if left untreated. His lack of religious belief could potentially indicate less internalized moral constraints, though this is not definitive.\n\nOverall, the risk factors provided do not suggest a high level of risk for recidivism. The confidence in this prediction is moderate (65), as more information about his background, family history, and current circumstances could alter this assessment.",
