    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n1. Age: Being young (21 years old) generally correlates with lower recidivism rates due to less life experience and established patterns.\n2. Gender: Males are often found to have higher recidivism rates than females in criminal justice statistics, but the single arrest and conviction, along with other factors, balance this out.\n3. Educational attainment: Having a GED certificate is typically associated with lower risk compared to those without a high school diploma or equivalent. The enrollment in a 4-year college further suggests lower risk due to the individual's commitment to personal growth and development.\n4. Employment history: Holding one job during the year indicates some level of work stability, which can positively impact recidivism rates.\n5. Criminal history: A single arrest and conviction is less concerning than multiple offenses or a pattern of criminal behavior.\n6. Substance use: Past drug use (marijuana) is common among young adults, but the frequency has decreased in recent months, suggesting that this individual may have reduced their substance use.\n7. Mental health: The occasional feeling of depression, while concerning, does not indicate a long-term or severe mental health issue that would significantly elevate risk.\n8. Personal background: Living alone and never being married suggests independence and self-sufficiency, which can be protective factors against recidivism.\n9. Religious beliefs: The individual's lack of religiosity does not necessarily correlate with higher risk, as it varies widely among individuals.\n10. Family history: Growing up in a small household and having lived with his biological mother may indicate some level of family support or stability, although the urban area could potentially introduce more risks.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk appears to be relatively low, with a confidence level of approximately 60%. However, it is essential to recognize that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and this assessment is based solely on the provided information. Continuous monitoring and evaluation would be necessary for a more accurate prediction over time.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
