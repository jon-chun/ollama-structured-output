The individual's young age (21) and male gender are not typically associated with high recidivism rates. However, a prior arrest and conviction, along with limited employment history, could indicate a higher risk. His GED certificate and enrollment in college suggest some level of motivation and commitment to personal development, which may mitigate risk.\n\nThe individual's drug use, particularly marijuana, is a significant factor as it can be associated with other criminal activities and mental health issues. His reported feelings of depression for extended periods are concerning, as they could indicate a risk for future antisocial behavior or self-harm.\n\nLiving arrangements (currently living alone) and family background (living with his mother in an urban area) do not provide clear indications of risk or protection. His religious beliefs (considering God has nothing to do with personal events) may not directly impact recidivism rates but could potentially influence his worldview and decision-making processes.\n\nConsidering these factors, the individual is predicted to be at high risk for reoffending, although the confidence level is moderate due to the lack of severe or cumulative risk factors.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
