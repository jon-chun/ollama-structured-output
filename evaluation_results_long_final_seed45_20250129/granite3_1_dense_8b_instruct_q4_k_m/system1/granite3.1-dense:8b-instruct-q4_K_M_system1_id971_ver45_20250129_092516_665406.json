    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Age and gender: A young male is generally considered less risky than older males, especially when it comes to violent crimes.\n2. Criminal history: While he has been arrested once and convicted, the single conviction indicates a relatively low level of criminal activity.\n3. Education: His enrollment in a 4-year college suggests a level of responsibility and future orientation that is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n4. Employment: Holding one job during the year suggests stability and commitment to work.\n5. Drug use: While he has used drugs, it's limited to marijuana, which is considered less serious than other illicit substances.\n6. Mental health: Although he reported feeling down at times, this does not necessarily indicate a severe mental health condition that would predict criminal behavior.\n7. Family background: Living with his biological mother and siblings in an urban area could suggest stability or exposure to positive influences.\n8. Religious beliefs: His disbelief in divine intervention in personal matters does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that risk assessment is complex and these factors should be considered alongside others not mentioned here (e.g., substance abuse history, criminal associates, prior delinquent behavior). This prediction is based solely on the provided information and carries a moderate level of confidence.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
