    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors presented indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (21) and gender (male) do not inherently suggest high-risk behavior. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which is not extensive. His physical attributes are average and he has maintained employment. He is currently enrolled in college and has held down a job, indicating stability. Although he has used drugs in the past, this does not necessarily predict future criminal behavior. His current feelings of depression could potentially be concerning if they persist or worsen, but at present, they do not indicate high-risk behavior. His upbringing in an urban area with his biological mother and siblings suggests a relatively stable family environment. Lastly, his disbelief in a higher power does not correlate with increased risk of criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is low due to the limited information provided and the subjective nature of risk assessment. More detailed information about his past behaviors, mental health history, social support system, and other potential risk factors would be needed for a more accurate prediction.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
