While the individual has a criminal history (1 arrest and 1 conviction), he is relatively young, which might suggest less entrenchment in criminal behavior. His current enrollment in college indicates potential for prosocial engagement and future opportunities. Although substance use and mental health indicators are present, they do not appear to be severe or chronic at this point. The individual's living situation (currently living alone) suggests a degree of self-sufficiency and independence. However, the overall confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the complexity of risk prediction.",
