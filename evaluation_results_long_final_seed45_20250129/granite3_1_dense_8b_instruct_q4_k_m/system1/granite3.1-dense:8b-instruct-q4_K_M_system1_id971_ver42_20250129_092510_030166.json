His arrest history is low (1 time), and his conviction rate is also low, which suggests a lower risk. He is physically average in size and weight, has held a job recently, and is enrolled in college, indicating some level of stability. His GED and current enrollment suggest an interest in self-improvement. His drug use is limited to marijuana, which may not significantly impact his risk assessment. His occasional feelings of sadness could indicate low mental health, but they do not necessarily predict criminal behavior. Living alone suggests some level of independence and self-sufficiency. Growing up in an urban household with his biological mother does not significantly increase risk factors. His disbelief in a higher power also does not correlate with increased risk. Given these factors, the overall risk is relatively low. However, the confidence score is low due to the limited information provided and the complexity of predicting criminal behavior accurately.",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
