    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n1. Age: At 21, the individual is young and typically less likely to engage in criminal behavior compared to older individuals.\n2. Gender: Males are generally more prone to criminal activity than females, but this factor alone does not significantly increase risk.\n3. Prior arrests and convictions: One prior arrest and one conviction suggest some involvement in criminal behavior, but the number is relatively low compared to individuals with multiple arrests or convictions.\n4. Physical characteristics: Height (5'7\") and weight (140 lbs) are not indicative of risk.\n5. Marital status: Never married is not a significant indicator of criminal behavior.\n6. Living situation: Living alone suggests some level of independence and self-sufficiency, which can be protective against criminal involvement.\n7. Education: Holding a GED certificate indicates basic educational attainment, while enrollment in college suggests future aspirations and stability.\n8. Employment history: Having held one job during the year is relatively stable compared to individuals with multiple jobs or unemployment.\n9. Substance use: Past marijuana use is common and does not significantly increase risk unless it's associated with other factors like addiction or frequent use.\n10. Mental health: Feeling \"down in the dumps\" occasionally is normal, but if this feeling persists for extended periods or is accompanied by other symptoms, it might indicate a mental health concern. However, based on the information provided, this factor alone does not significantly increase risk.\n11. Family background: Living with his biological mother in an urban household of three suggests some level of family support and stability.\n12. Religious beliefs: The individual's belief that God has nothing to do with personal circumstances is not indicative of risk.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk appears relatively low. However, it's essential to remember that risk assessments are complex and multifaceted, and this analysis is based on limited information.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
