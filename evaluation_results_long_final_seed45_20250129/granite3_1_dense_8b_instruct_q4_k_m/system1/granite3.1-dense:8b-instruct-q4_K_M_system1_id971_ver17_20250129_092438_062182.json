    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a moderate risk level, not high. While the individual has a past arrest and conviction, he is young (21), has never been married, and currently lives alone, which can suggest lower stability. His use of drugs in the past four years and recent feelings of depression are also concerning. However, his enrollment in college and current employment indicate some level of responsibility and stability. Living situation, age, and education level are often key factors in risk assessment models. The individual's lack of religious belief doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk. The urban upbringing, single-parent household, and small family size could potentially increase risk, but the specific details provided do not offer much insight into these factors' impact on his behavior. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.",
