    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this risk assessment case step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He has a criminal history: one arrest and a conviction. At 5'7\" and 140 lbs, he might be categorized as underweight, but that doesn't directly indicate high risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which could suggest some level of independence but also possible isolation or instability. His educational background is a GED and attending college, which are positive steps toward better opportunities.\n\nHe has one job, so income stability isn't an immediate concern, though unemployment can be risky if it leads to financial strain. He's used marijuana in the past four years, with recent use during the month indicating possible substance abuse that might affect his mental state or relationships.\n\nHis recent emotional low suggests he might be struggling emotionally, which could impact decision-making and risk-taking behaviors. His early life experience living with his mother in a household of three in an urban area indicates exposure to potentially stressful environments, though it's not clear how directly this affects his current behavior.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life, which might suggest a lack of religious support or a focus on other values. This could be a risk factor if it leads him towards negative behaviors influenced by his own beliefs rather than guidance from a higher power.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest, current substance use, emotional low, and a belief in a lack of divine influence. These elements collectively increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or self-harming behaviors. Therefore, despite some mitigating factors like education and living alone, the overall risk assessment leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
