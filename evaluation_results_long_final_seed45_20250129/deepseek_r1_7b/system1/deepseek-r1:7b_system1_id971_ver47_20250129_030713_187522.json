    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old male, White. Being young might not directly correlate to higher risk unless in certain contexts, but that alone isn't enough. He has one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because even a single offense can be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a strong indicator of risk on its own unless combined with other factors like BMI, but that's not provided here.\n\nNot married and living alone suggests he might have less support network which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if it's ongoing, but having a GED might indicate previous stability.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unemployment or lack of steady work can increase risk as it affects financial stability and ability to support oneself.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt very down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse, which can lead to other behavioral issues and higher risk of negative outcomes.\n\nFeeling down for extended periods suggests possible mental health issues, like depression or anxiety, both of which are significant risk factors that can influence behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area might suggest exposure to certain environments or potential family dynamics. The mention could imply instability if there's further info, but it's unclear.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal life indicates he doesn't have religious support, which could impact his ability to seek help or maintain positive relationships.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest and conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior issues. Drug use, feelings of low mood for a while, living situation possibly unstable due to family dynamics, and lack of religious support add up to suggest he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
