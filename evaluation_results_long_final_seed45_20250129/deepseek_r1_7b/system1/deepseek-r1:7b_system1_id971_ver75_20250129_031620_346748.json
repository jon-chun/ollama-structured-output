    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on the criteria provided. The person is a 21-year-old male, White, arrested once and convicted. He's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Single, no kids, has a GED, attending college, one job in the past year, used marijuana in the past four years. In the last month, he felt really down all the time, which might indicate some level of depression or trauma. He lived with his mom at a young age in an urban area of size 3. His spirituality seems inconsistent\u2014he believes God has nothing to do with his personal life.\n\nHmm, I should break this down point by point. Age-wise, he's quite young\u201421. Being White might not directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues, but that's more context than given here. He was arrested once and convicted; that could be a sign of past problematic behavior, possibly leading to instability.\n\nHis physical stats don't immediately show anything out of the ordinary\u2014the height is average for his age, weight is on the lower side. Being single and living alone might contribute to feelings of isolation or loneliness, which can affect mental health.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which is positive as it shows he's seeking education. Having one job suggests some level of stability, but not too high\u2014maybe it's part-time or he's still finding his way. Drug use, specifically marijuana, is present but not necessarily recent. The mention that last month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up indicates possible depression or a low mood.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area could have its challenges\u2014maybe family issues or environment stressors. His belief in God might be affecting his mental state, perhaps leading to copious use of marijuana as a coping mechanism if he's feeling lost or unhappy.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a arrest and conviction history, which is a risk factor but not the most severe unless there are other factors. His living situation and feelings of isolation could contribute to emotional instability. The GED and college enrollment might help in turning things around. The fact that he's using marijuana might suggest some substance abuse issues, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I think the risk is somewhat high but not extremely so. There are warning signs like living situation and feelings of sadness, but he also has positive factors like education and being single (though that could be a double-edged sword). The arrest history suggests some past issues, which could indicate present challenges.\n\nSo, putting this into the JSON format as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
