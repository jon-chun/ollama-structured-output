    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this risk factor step by step. \n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. That might be relevant for certain studies but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. One prior arrest can indicate some level of criminal history, which might suggest past behavior that could impact future decisions, though it depends on other factors like the nature of the offense.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. While weight can be a factor in recidivism studies, without more data on his body type or health issues, this isn't directly indicative of risk.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently make someone a risk, but it could be associated with higher stress levels, which might affect behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education can sometimes be linked to better job opportunities or personal development, so this might lower the risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employed individuals generally have less incentive to engage in illegal activities compared to those who are unemployed.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down for some of the last month. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent or severe. The mention of feeling down might indicate other underlying issues that could contribute to risk behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 3 in an urban area suggests he was raised by his father. That could have shaped his values and behaviors, but again, context matters.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life\u2014this reflects a lack of religious support, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk taking or problem behavior, especially if other supportive systems aren't in place.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there are points that suggest he might be at moderate risk. The prior arrest is a concern, but the presence of education and being employed somewhat mitigates that. The drug use could be an indicator of ongoing issues. The lack of religious support adds to potential risk factors. \n\nHowever, without more detailed information on his current situation, job stability, mental health, etc., it's hard to pin this down definitively as high risk but not entirely safe either.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
