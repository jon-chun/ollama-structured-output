    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this risk factor indicates a high risk. First, the person is a 21-year-old male from White background. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense; depending on the type of crime, that could be significant. He has a GED, which might mean he has some educational background but isn't a college graduate yet.\n\nHe's living alone, which can sometimes indicate independence, but it also means no support network unless someone else knows him well. His current occupation is 4-year college, so he's still working toward an education. That could be positive as he's motivated to get ahead.\n\nHe's never been married and currently single, which might mean he doesn't have family to rely on. He's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't specified more recently. It's not clear if this is frequent or recent, but substance use can be a risk factor for various issues, including mental health problems.\n\nHe felt down during the past month and couldn't find joy, which might suggest underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety. That's a red flag because these conditions often lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe was raised in a household of three in an urban area at a young age without religious involvement from his mother. Growing up alone can have both positive aspects, like independence, but it might also mean he doesn't have the same level of support or understanding as those with family involved. It could also indicate potential neglect if there are issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of a prior conviction, potential mental health issues from his emotional state, and living in a somewhat challenging environment without religious support points towards him being at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
