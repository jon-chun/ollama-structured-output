    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Being a minority might have some implications in terms of systemic issues or discrimination, but it alone probably doesn't make him a high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions can indicate past behavior that might lead to re-offending. So this is definitely pointing towards a high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, which isn't particularly concerning on its own. Weight of 140 lbs also doesn't stand out; he could be at a healthy weight or maybe overweight depending on his activity level. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. This could indicate underlying issues but whether it's high risk depends on the context.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education level is usually associated with lower recidivism rates. Having a GED suggests he's motivated to improve his situation through education, which might reduce future risk.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Single employment can lead to financial stress if something happens, but having at least one job shows some stability. However, working multiple jobs isn't mentioned here either way.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood suggests possible substance abuse issues. This could contribute to risky behaviors or self-harm, which are indicators of high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This might indicate family instability or neglect, which can be predictors of future criminal behavior. Additionally, considering that God doesn't play into his life could suggest a lack of religious support and possible coping mechanisms for stress or emotional issues.\n\nPutting all this together, prior arrest and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. The other factors like living alone, substance use, family background, and lack of religious involvement also contribute to the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Therefore, despite some mitigating factors like education and being White, overall the risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
