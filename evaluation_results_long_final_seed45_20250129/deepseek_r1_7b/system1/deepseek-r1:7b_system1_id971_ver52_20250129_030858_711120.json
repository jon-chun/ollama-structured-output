    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Being young might actually lower the risk since he's still developing socially and emotionally, but race can sometimes be a factor in certain studies or assessments.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant red flag because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism, which increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. While height and weight can be indicators depending on body composition, they don't directly correlate to risk unless combined with other factors like BMI or health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation, which he admitted to experiencing. This isolation could contribute to his mood swings and feelings of low self-worth, both of which are concerning.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having educational opportunities might actually indicate better prospects, but if he's not engaging with them or using the education for personal growth, it might be a risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to economic instability and stress, which might contribute to negative mood states as mentioned.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can impair judgment and increase risky behaviors.\n\nIn the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates persistent low mood, which could be a sign of depression or other mental health issues. Both can significantly impact an individual's ability to function responsibly.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a setting might have affected his family dynamics and emotional well-being, especially if there are issues like abuse or neglect which aren't mentioned here but could be inferred.\n\nFinally, he believes that God has no role in his personal life. This lack of religious support can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation and a sense of helplessness, which may contribute to risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (1), drug use, low mood, living with a biological mother, and potential isolation due to his upbringing, along with his current state of being jobless and living alone, all point towards a high risk. The individual's age might mitigate some risks, but the other factors are quite concerning.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with a confidence level that reflects these multiple warning signs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
