    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm presented with this query where someone is asking me as a risk assessment expert to analyze certain risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. The response needs to be a JSON object with \"prediction\" as either YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each of the risk factors provided:\n\n1. **Age and Race**: A 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Generally, younger individuals might be at a lower risk for recidivism compared to older adults, but race can also play a role in some studies. However, without specific data on how race correlates with risk here, it's hard to assign a high confidence level.\n\n2. **Conviction History**: He has been arrested once and convicted. One conviction is a significant factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Demographics**: Standing alone at 5'7\" and weighing 140 lbs doesn't immediately indicate risk, but considering his age, it's less relevant than other factors.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: He's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or substance abuse incidents involving others.\n\n5. **Education Level**: Having a GED and attending college shows he has some educational background, which might correlate with better job opportunities and lower risk.\n\n6. **Employment**: He's held only one job during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, but having at least a job suggests he's not unemployed, which is positive.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana in the past four years. drug use, especially recent, could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which might increase risk.\n\n8. **Mental Health Symptoms**: He feels very down and has had \"nothing to cheer him up\" in the past month. Persistent feelings of low mood without significant support can be indicative of depression or anxiety, both of which can affect risk behavior.\n\n9. **Upbringing**: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This might suggest exposure to family dynamics and possibly socioeconomic factors that could influence behavior.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: He doesn't believe in God personally. This lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with lower commitment to community or higher rates of substance abuse, which are risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The one conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior. The mention of drug use and persistent low mood points towards potential mental health issues that could affect decision-making. His living situation alone doesn't necessarily indicate risk but combined with other factors like depression and prior convictions, it adds up to suggest a higher risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I would lean towards a high risk prediction. The confidence level is set at 75% because while there are mitigating factors like living alone and education, the presence of prior convictions and possible mental health issues significantly increase the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
