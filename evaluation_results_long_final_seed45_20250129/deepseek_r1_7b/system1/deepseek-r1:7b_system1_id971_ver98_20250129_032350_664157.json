    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk based on the given information.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once and convicted, which suggests past criminal behavior, though he only has one conviction at 21. That's concerning but not immediately alarming since it's early in his life.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. No information on weight relative to health or substance use yet.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of sadness or depression. His current mood is down for some time without improvement, which could indicate depression or anxiety.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's motivated to learn and improve his situation. That's positive behavior but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are academic struggles elsewhere.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, so employment history isn't an issue here since it's just one job. Drug use: he used marijuana before and in the past month felt really down. marijuana can be a gateway drug, potentially leading to more substance use.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area might have exposed him to certain influences or environments that could impact his behavior.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life suggests he's atheist or agnostic. This can sometimes be associated with higher rates of substance abuse, depression, and criminal behavior as he may turn to other explanations for his experiences.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a past arrest but only one conviction at 21. His living situation and belief system could contribute to emotional distress leading to drug use and possibly more behavioral issues. The mood he's in seems to be influenced by both external factors (past environment) and personal beliefs, which might not directly point towards high risk but needs further assessment.\n\nConsidering all these, I think the risk is moderately high because of potential underlying issues like depression or anxiety exacerbating existing drug use, especially if there are academic or employment challenges. However, without more data on his mental health status or other risk factors, it's a bit uncertain. But leaning towards YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
