    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down each risk factor:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old. Young adults are typically considered low risk compared to older individuals who might have more life experience contributing to substance use or other issues.\n   \n2. Race: White. While race can influence outcomes due to systemic factors, the analysis here is based on personal behavior and circumstances.\n\n3. Arrests and Convictions: He has been arrested once and convicted. This indicates some criminal history which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\n4. Physical characteristics: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. No immediate red flags, but weight could relate to substance use issues if relevant.\n\n5. Marital status: He's never married. Not directly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors like substance use.\n\n6. Housing situation: Living alone. Living away from family can sometimes be a protective factor, especially if there are supportive networks missing, but it depends on context.\n\n7. Education: Has a GED and is in college. Educational attainment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates when stable.\n\n8. Employment: Holds 1 job during the year. Employment, especially full-time or part-time, can provide stability and reduce stress, which might be linked to substance use issues.\n\n9. Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for most of the past month. This is a significant factor; frequent drug use, especially recent, can increase risk of relapse or further substance abuse problems.\n\n10. Emotional state: Felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates low mood or depression, which are strong indicators of potential high risk behavior such as substance abuse.\n\n11. Family history: At a young age, lived with biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Early-life experiences can influence behavior; living with others might have provided support but the size of the household could also indicate other family dynamics or challenges that may affect behavior.\n\n12. Beliefs: Doesn't consider God as a factor in his personal events. This could relate to spirituality, which sometimes influences substance use patterns, though it's not directly linked here.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe individual has a history of arrest and drug use, along with emotional distress. These factors are strong indicators of high risk for substance abuse or related issues. The other factors don't necessarily outweigh these negatives. Therefore, the prediction should be high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
