    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for the individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not be directly indicative of risk unless there are other factors at play. His criminal history is one arrest and a conviction, which could suggest past behavior issues but isn't immediately alarming on its own.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs, which doesn't provide much insight into his risk level. Not married and living alone; that might indicate he's an independent individual, which can sometimes be protective against certain risks.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's actively seeking education or furthering his knowledge. That could imply he's motivated to change his circumstances, reducing some risk factors.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Single employment might indicate stability compared to those unemployed for extended periods, which can be protective against certain risks like dependency on drugs.\n\nDrug use history: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down often recently. This could point towards potential substance abuse issues, which do have significant implications on behavior and social functioning.\n\nHis recent emotional state\u2014he feels down a lot lately\u2014suggests possible underlying mental health concerns or stressors that might affect his decision-making or relationships.\n\nLiving at a young age with his mother in a household of three in an urban area. That environment could introduce stressors, though without more context on the family dynamics or support systems, it's hard to gauge fully.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life is a significant factor. This worldview can influence risk-taking behaviors and decision-making, potentially increasing risk if it leads to unstable choices or self-harm.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest and conviction are there but not immediately alarming because of the other positive factors like education, employment, and living independently. However, the substance use history, emotional state, and lack of religious belief might indicate some underlying issues that could pose a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
