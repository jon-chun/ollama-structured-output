    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, White. Age seems young, but it can be both pro and con depending on the context. Being White might influence his background or opportunities, but I don't see anything here that stands out as highly concerning.\n\nHe has one arrest and a conviction. That's not a lot, so it's probably a minor offense. But it does show some history with the law.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. No issues there; looks like a healthy range for his height.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That might indicate he's an only child or not in a committed relationship, but without more info, it's hard to tell if that affects risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. High school equivalency plus further education suggests he's motivated and possibly looking for better opportunities, which could be a positive sign.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Having some income might reduce dependency on other aspects of his life, like drugs or unstable living situations.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time in the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up. This could indicate substance abuse issues, which is concerning because it can affect mental health and self-esteem, potentially leading to more risky behavior.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That's a family environment, but if he was mistreated or didn't have much support, that could be problematic. However, the fact that it's an urban area doesn't necessarily make it worse unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse.\n\nHe believes God has no role in his personal life. This might indicate a lack of religious support and some level of spirituality missing from his life, which could affect his mental health if he relies on faith for coping with stress or trauma.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning factors are the drug use (specifically marijuana) and perhaps the belief that religion isn't involved in his life. These can lead to self-destructive behaviors and emotional instability. His lack of marriage might not be directly related, but other factors like living alone could contribute to isolation or substance abuse issues.\n\nI think this person is at a moderate risk level for high-risk assessment because while he has some positive attributes like education and employment, the drug use and lack of religious support are red flags that could lead to more significant risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
