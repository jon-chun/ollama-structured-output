    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given risk factors. I'm going to go through each factor one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, he's 21 years old, male, White. His race doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are stereotypes involved, but that's more of an assumption. Being young might actually be a protective factor since younger offenders often have fewer criminal tendencies.\n\nHe has a arrest record with one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions can increase future risk. However, it depends on the nature of the previous offense\u2014whether it was minor or serious. Since it's not specified, I'll consider it as a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. These aren't directly related to criminal behavior unless there's an association with physical strength or substance use, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can be linked to higher rates of substance abuse or unstable environments, but without more info on his living conditions or financial stability, it's hard to gauge the risk from this alone.\n\nHaving a GED and attending college is positive. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates. However, not completing high school might have different implications, but since he's got a GED and going to college, that's a good sign.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment is generally linked to stability and lower risk of further criminal behavior compared to those without steady income sources.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years. This could be problematic as drug use can lead to health issues or other behavioral problems, which might contribute to higher risk elsewhere.\n\nHis recent feeling of low mood for most of the month is concerning. Mood issues could indicate underlying mental health issues that might lead to substance abuse or self-harm, both of which are high-risk indicators.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area suggests he was raised by his father or guardians away from home. Urban environments can have different social dynamics and may be associated with higher rates of certain issues but without knowing the broader context, it's hard to assess.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life is a strong indicator of potential clinically significant delusions of grandeur or religious neglect. This could affect his decision-making, judgment, and overall behavior, increasing risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (1), drug use (yes), low mood (yes), and religious neglect (yes) are all high-risk factors. These should weigh the prediction towards high risk despite positive factors like education and living alone.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
