    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 21 years old. Young age can be both pro and con depending on the context. At that age, he might still be developing skills or maybe facing challenges, but it could also mean he hasn't had much life experience yet.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some societal bias, which isn't indicated in the factors provided.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can be significant because it shows he has faced legal issues before, but without more info, it's hard to gauge how severe it was or if there are any underlying issues from that arrest.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. No direct risk factors here unless this relates to his behavior, which I don't see a connection to in the given factors.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with lower social support, which might contribute to higher risk of issues like substance use or depression.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually correlates with better job prospects and financial stability, so this is a positive indicator against high risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having at least some steady income can provide financial stability, which is generally protective against many risks.\n\nHis drug use: he used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the last month feeling down and not finding anything to cheer him up. This could indicate feelings of depression or low motivation, which might be linked to substance abuse issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That's a family environment that might influence his behavior, but without knowing if it was supportive or how he interacts now, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which some studies link to higher rates of substance abuse and depression. This alone isn't definitive, though.\n\nPutting this all together: He has one prior conviction but no other major issues; he's in school, which is positive; however, he does have substance use history and possibly underlying mental health concerns due to feeling down. The lack of a stable living situation might also contribute. Considering these factors, I would lean towards high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
