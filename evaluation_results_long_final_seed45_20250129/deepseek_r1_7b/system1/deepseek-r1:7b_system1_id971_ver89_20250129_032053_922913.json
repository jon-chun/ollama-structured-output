    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Okay, first, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Not sure how race plays into it here, but maybe his background or other factors could influence.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and a conviction. That means he's already gone through some trouble before. Experience with law enforcement might indicate instability or trust issues, which can be risky.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight is 140 lbs. Not sure if that affects anything here directly. Maybe more about his physical health?\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone could mean he doesn't have a support system, which might make him more susceptible to stress or substance use.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can sometimes help with getting better job opportunities, but if he's struggling academically, that could be a risk factor too.\n\nHe held one job during the year, so maybe not very stable financially. Unemployment or underemployment often correlates with higher risk of substance abuse and other issues.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, and recently felt really down for some time. Substance use can have negative impacts on mental health and relationships, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nHe felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. That's a sign of persistent low mood, which might be related to depression or other mental health issues. That's concerning because chronic stress can lead to more risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That suggests exposure to potentially neglect or abuse as a child. This is a red flag for long-term stability and emotional well-being.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and sees no personal connection to spirituality or divine intervention. This might affect his coping mechanisms; without religious support, he might turn to other substances or ways of dealing with stress.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, living alone, substance use, recent negative feelings, child abuse background, lack of religious support. All these factors point towards a high risk of engaging in risky behaviors. He's likely to have ongoing issues that could lead to further problems if not addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
