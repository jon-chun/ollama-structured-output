    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's a red flag right there.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's committed to improving his education and maybe his future prospects. Education can sometimes lower the risk, but if he's not using it, that might be an issue. He's got some drug use history, specifically marijuana, which could indicate substance abuse problems. Substance abuse often correlates with higher risk of recidivism.\n\nHe felt so down in the past month and couldn't find someone to cheer him up. That might point towards issues like depression or low self-esteem, both of which can affect his ability to function or maintain sobriety. It's also concerning that he doesn't see a connection with God in his life; this lack of spiritual support might mean he has other personal issues or coping mechanisms that aren't healthy.\n\nHe's young at 21 and living alone without a family, which could mean he's dealing with emotional or mental health challenges. Young adults often have higher stress levels and may not have the same level of social support as older individuals.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, while some are mitigating (like education and being in college), others like prior convictions, drug use, and lack of family support point towards a high risk. The presence of multiple concerning factors without strong mitigations suggests that this individual is likely to have a high risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
