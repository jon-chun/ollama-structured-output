    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor JSON for a risk assessment. The person is a 21-year-old male, White, with a GED and currently enrolled in college. That's positive regarding education, which often correlates with better outcomes.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, so prior criminal history. Age 21 might indicate he's still developing, but one arrest could be significant. He's not married and living alone\u2014solo living can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are no support networks.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. He felt down during the last month. That could indicate emotional issues or perhaps substance abuse causing distress. \n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That's concerning because growing up in such an environment can have negative impacts on mental health and personal well-being.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal life might suggest he struggles with spirituality or faith, which could impact his decision-making and support systems.\n\nHe feels down often but nothing cheers him up\u2014this might point towards a lack of resilience or access to positive coping mechanisms. His current job situation is also something to consider; only one job while enrolled in college might mean he's juggling education and work, adding stress.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrest (negative), education and college enrollment (positive), living alone with no support (negative), substance use (negative), and family background (negative). The factors seem to lean towards high risk despite some positive traits. I'd rate this a YES with 70% confidence because multiple negative indicators point toward higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
