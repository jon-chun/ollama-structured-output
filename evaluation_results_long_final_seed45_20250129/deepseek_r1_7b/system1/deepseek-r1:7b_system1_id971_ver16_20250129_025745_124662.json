    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. So first, he's a 21-year-old male who's White. Arrested once and convicted\u2014so one prior offense. He's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Never married, living alone. Has a GED and is in college. Worked one job recently. Drug use: marijuana in past four years, but only in the last month with some severe mood issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. He doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life.\n\nHmm, okay, starting with the arrest and conviction\u20141 prior offense might indicate some instability or past issues that could affect behavior.\n\nHis living situation: single, no kids, which is common among you know what... but maybe it's contributing to stress? The GED and college enrollment suggest he's trying to improve his situation educationally. Maybe that's a positive sign.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana is not a big deal legally, so maybe he hasn't taken it seriously before. But recent drug use could be a red flag, especially if it's leading to mood issues now.\n\nHe's 21, young age, which might mean he has fewer life experiences and perhaps more susceptible to negative influences or stressors at home.\n\nLiving with his mother in an urban area\u2014could that provide stability? Maybe not always. Urban areas can have higher crime rates but also offer opportunities. But considering he was living with her when he was younger, maybe there's some support structure.\n\nBelief in God: If he doesn't see a divine connection to personal issues, it might mean he relies on other factors like friends or the legal system for help, which could be more volatile.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a relatively clean record except for one arrest. His living situation is somewhat stable but could have its own challenges. Drug use is present but not severe yet. At 21, still developing, so maybe more prone to negative influences if he's exposed to them.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because of the GED and college enrollment, which show commitment to improving. But considering his young age and potential exposure to stressors or negative influences, it might be moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
