    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm presented with a query where someone wants me to act as a risk assessment expert analyzing certain risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. The user specified that the response must be only a JSON object with \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". \n\nFirst, I'll need to carefully analyze each of the provided risk factors one by one.\n\nStarting with the person being 21, male, White \u2013 these are general descriptors without immediate red flags, so not immediately concerning. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a past criminal record. This raises some concern but isn't the most significant factor yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't provide much insight on their own, but combined with other factors like being single and having a GED, it might suggest he's in a certain life stage or situation. His lack of marriage and living alone could be indicative of instability, which is concerning.\n\nThe presence of a GED certificate along with college enrollment shows he has some education and is committed to furthering his studies, which might indicate better prospects than someone without any formal education.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year \u2013 that's quite a short time in the workforce. If he's currently unemployed or underemployed, that could signal issues with employment stability or motivation.\n\nDrug use history: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. This could indicate substance abuse issues, which can affect judgment, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nThe sentiment expressed about feeling down for some time during the past month adds another layer of concern regarding mental health or emotional stability. \n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area might suggest family instability or neglect, which are factors that could influence behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal life could point towards a lack of faith or spirituality, which some may associate with lower self-esteem or motivation to seek help when needed.\n\nPutting all these together: A past conviction, living alone, substance use, emotional state, family background, and possibly a lack of strong support system. These factors collectively suggest that this individual is at higher risk for certain negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
