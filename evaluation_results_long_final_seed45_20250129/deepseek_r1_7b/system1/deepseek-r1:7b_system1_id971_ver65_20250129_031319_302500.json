    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from White background, arrested once and convicted. That's significant because recidivism is common among this age group. The fact that he has a GED might mean he's sought after for employment or stable living, which could be a positive indicator but not necessarily if it's affecting his current situation negatively.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight-wise, he's under the BMI for being underweight, so maybe low self-esteem? But I don't have info on diet or exercise habits, so that might be a risk factor without more context.\n\nLiving alone suggests some level of independence but could also mean isolation, which can lead to depression-like feelings. His current mood is down, and he felt so low that nothing could cheer him up in the past month. This could indicate depression, which is a serious mental health issue affecting his ability to manage daily tasks like work or maintaining relationships.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone, so maybe he feels lonely. Loneliness can contribute to depression and substance use issues. He used marijuana in the past four years\u2014could be part of his drug use pattern, which might affect his self-esteem or relationships.\n\nHis past living situation with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area could have left him isolated as a child, possibly leading to behavioral issues or stress that's affecting him now. His belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might be experiencing spiritual distress or searching for meaning elsewhere, which can impact mental health.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: past convictions at 21 suggest potential for future issues; substance use and depressed mood indicate possible mental health challenges; living alone contributes to feelings of isolation and depression. These all point towards a high risk assessment. I'll rate this an 85% confidence that he presents a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
