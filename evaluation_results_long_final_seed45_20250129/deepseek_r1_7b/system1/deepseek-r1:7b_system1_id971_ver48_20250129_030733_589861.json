    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being younger might be associated with lower recidivism rates, but race can sometimes have indirect effects through systemic issues or socioeconomic factors related to his background.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and a conviction. One arrest isn't typically considered high risk on its own, as it's common for individuals to make mistakes once in their lives. However, it does suggest some past behavior that could be a precursor to further issues.\n\nHe is 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight doesn't directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse and isolation, but without more context on his mental health or living situation, it's hard to gauge the extent of that risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level usually correlates with better job prospects and lower likelihood of reoffending, so this might actually reduce his risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Job experience can be positive as it shows stability, but if he's unemployed or underemployed now, that could increase risk.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can lead to other risky behaviors or health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to family dynamics that might influence his behavior. However, the size and urban setting alone don't necessarily correlate with high risk unless there are underlying issues like neglect or abuse.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could be linked to religious influences affecting his behavior. If he's not seeking spiritual guidance, it might indicate a lack of support system which can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of substance use (marijuana), recent feelings of low mood, and lack of a strong religious or family support could increase the risk despite being young, having some convictions, and having an educational background. The job situation might not be ideal, but he's holding something now. \n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because of the drug use and mood indicators which are significant risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
