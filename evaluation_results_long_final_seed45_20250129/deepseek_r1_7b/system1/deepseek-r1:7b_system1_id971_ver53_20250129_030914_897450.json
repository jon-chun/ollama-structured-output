The user wants a JSON response with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, the person is White, which might be relevant due to racial profiling in some contexts, but at 21, it's early in his life. He has one arrest and a prior conviction\u2014so a history of legal issues could indicate past behavior that might affect future stability.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 140 lbs. That doesn't immediately jump out as a red flag unless combined with other factors like weight management, but alone it's not enough to predict high risk.\n\nNot married and living alone\u2014no immediate concerns here. It could mean he's focused on school or work, which are positive aspects.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education levels are generally positive indicators of future stability and employability unless the person is avoiding education entirely.\n\nHe worked one job during the year\u2014I guess that shows some level of responsibility and ability to support himself.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which could be problematic if it's recent or frequent. The mention that he felt down a lot recently might indicate underlying mental health issues.\n\n living with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area\u2014could suggest exposure to certain environments, maybe stressors from that upbringing.\n\nBelieving God doesn't affect his life\u2014it suggests he's more secular and might have different coping mechanisms for stress or emotional issues.\n\nPutting this together: He has a prior conviction which is a negative factor. Drug use especially recent could be concerning. His belief in God might not help with coping, but he's young so maybe not as developed emotionally yet.\n\nI think the risk isn't extremely high, but there are factors that point towards moderate risk. Maybe around 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
