    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing these risk factors for a 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, age 21. Being a minority can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, but at this young age, it might not be as significant yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is definitely a red flag, especially at such an early age. It suggests some level of criminal behavior in the past, which could point towards future issues.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. While weight can sometimes be associated with risk behaviors like substance use, without more context on his BMI or activity levels, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there are other factors like instability in the home environment. But given he's 21, it might be a transitional phase.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Completing high school and pursuing further education usually indicates stability and less likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. This could actually lower his risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having gainful employment is a positive sign as it shows he's capable of supporting himself and possibly leading a stable life.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years, but importantly, he also stated that some of the time in the past month he felt extremely down and couldn't be cheered up. This latter point suggests significant distress or substance abuse issues, which can contribute to high-risk behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age might indicate living conditions that could be unstable, especially if there are family dynamics or neglect issues he's not aware of.\n\nHis belief in God regarding personal events suggests he doesn't look to religion for coping with stress, which might mean he deals with emotions differently and possibly has higher stress levels leading to substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest is a significant negative indicator. The drug use and emotional distress are also concerning. While he's young and enrolled in college, these factors could indicate potential issues that need attention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
