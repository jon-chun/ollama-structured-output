    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant red flag because criminal history can lead to more unstable behavior or substance abuse issues.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't see how that directly affects the risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe not as much of an impact on this case.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise concerns about weight or health issues. Unless there's a history of eating disorders, but that's not indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to mental health issues or substance abuse if he's struggling with coping mechanisms.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level usually correlates positively with better job prospects and lower recidivism rates, so this might actually reduce risk rather than increase it.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on drugs or alcohol as a means of survival, which could be risky behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but not recently. While marijuana use is less severe than other drugs, it can still affect mood and behavior. The recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying issues that could worsen if not addressed.\n\nHis young age (21) with a history of living with his biological mother in a household of three suggests possible family dysfunction or emotional neglect, which could impact his mental health and decision-making abilities.\n\nLastly, he believes God has no bearing on his personal life. This might indicate a lack of spiritual support or guidance, which can sometimes be linked to substance abuse or neglecting mental health.\n\nPutting it all together: The criminal history is a strong indicator of potential for future issues. The young age, past living situation, and beliefs about spirituality could contribute to instability. However, the presence of education and being in college might mitigate some risks. Considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards high risk but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
