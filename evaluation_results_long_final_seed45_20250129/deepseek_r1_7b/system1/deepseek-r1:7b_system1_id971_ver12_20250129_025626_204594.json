    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on the provided information. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are generally indicators of higher risk, as they show criminal history which can affect future behavior or willingness to comply with interventions.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator unless combined with other factors like BMI, but in this case, it seems neutral on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk because there are fewer people to support him during times of stress or difficulty, which might increase his likelihood of substance use or isolation.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Educational attainment, especially with a GED, can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if attended regularly. However, being in college also suggests he's proactive about improving himself, which might be a mitigating factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Job experience generally indicates stability and self-sufficiency, so holding a job could reduce risk compared to someone without employment.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years but specifically mentioned marijuana recently. Drug use is concerning, especially since it's been ongoing for some time. However, the frequency of use (once or twice per month) might indicate occasional use rather than chronic dependence, which could be a consideration.\n\nHe felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up during the past month. This suggests he's experiencing significant emotional distress, which is a strong indicator of possible high risk. Emotional distress can lead to substance abuse, neglect of responsibilities, or other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living in such a setting could potentially expose him to stressors like domestic abuse, neglect, or socioeconomic challenges that might contribute to risk factors.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with higher levels of anxiety or depression, which are linked to increased risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior arrest and conviction (high risk), living alone without a support system (moderate risk), drug use but occasional (low to moderate), emotional distress (high risk), and personal beliefs affecting mental health (moderate). \n\nThe overall assessment would lean towards high risk. I'll set the confidence level at 75% because while there are mitigating factors like educational pursuits, the combination of arrest history, drug use, emotional distress, and personal belief issues points strongly toward high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
