    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given criteria. Let's break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being 21 isn't particularly high, but it can still be relevant depending on the context of his criminal history and other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. One prior arrest could indicate some level of criminal behavior in the past, which might suggest ongoing risk if he's not getting better or there are underlying issues contributing to this.\n\nHis demographic information: White male at 5'7\" and 140 lbs. While race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's more about systemic factors rather than individual risk unless other risk factors are present.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't directly indicate high risk but could be an indicator of substance abuse or isolation leading to other issues.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having educational opportunities can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, especially if he's committed to furthering his education, which might suggest lower risk compared to someone without such opportunities.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employed for only part of the year could indicate instability or underemployment, which might be a red flag for potential issues like substance abuse or other personal problems affecting his work performance.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down frequently in the last month. Substance abuse can have significant negative impacts on both personal and professional life, increasing risk of further criminal behavior, strained relationships, and health issues.\n\nFeeling down for extended periods suggests possible depression or low mood, which could be an indicator of mental health issues. If he's feeling this way, it might contribute to other risky behaviors or substance use.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Family environment can influence behavior and personality; living with three people might indicate some level of instability if there are ongoing issues like abuse or neglect, though that's not directly mentioned here.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could suggest a lack of religious support or spirituality. This might affect his coping mechanisms for stress or emotional challenges, potentially increasing risk behaviors.\n\nPutting all this together: The arrest and prior convictions are present but only once. Drug use is ongoing, which can lead to further legal issues if he becomes more engaged in substance abuse. His living situation with three people at a young age might indicate some instability, though it's not explicitly stated as problematic. He has some educational background and is attending college, which could be a positive factor. However, his feelings of low mood and lack of family support could contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I would rate this individual as high risk because the presence of drug use, potential underlying mental health issues, and maybe a combination of personal circumstances that aren't fully explored here can increase the likelihood of further criminal behavior or negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
