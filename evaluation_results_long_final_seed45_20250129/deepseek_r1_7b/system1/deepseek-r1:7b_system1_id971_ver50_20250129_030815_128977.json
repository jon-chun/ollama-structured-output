    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age might not be directly indicative unless there are typical age groups known for higher crime rates, but at 21, he's young, so maybe not a strong risk factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions can indicate past criminal behavior or substance abuse issues, which are linked to recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight is 140 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out as abnormal unless there's context about typical ranges for his age, but I don't have that info. Probably not significant here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because being an only child might lead to neglect or domestic abuse issues, especially if he's raising himself financially without support.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. GED holders often seek further education, which could indicate better life choices. However, being enrolled in college doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can sometimes be linked to higher self-esteem after completing high school.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014maybe part-time or not very stable. Unstable employment is a risk factor as it can lead to financial instability and increased substance use.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years, which could lead to poorer decision-making and higher recidivism rates. Also, feeling down for extended periods might be tied to drug abuse or lack of engagement in life.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014could indicate potential neglect or abuse if there were issues, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and considers it has nothing to do with his personal events. This could be a sign of determinism or lack of faith affecting his behavior or outlook on life, which might influence risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of past issues that could lead to high risk. Drug use is another significant factor. Living alone without a support system also contributes. The belief in God not influencing his personal events might suggest he's more self-driven, but combined with other factors like prior convictions and drug use, it leans towards high risk.\n\nI should assign a confidence level based on the number of strong indicators\u2014arrest, drug use, living situation, lack of marriage and college attendance. Maybe 85% confidence as these are multiple points pushing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
