    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That\u2019s within a typical age range and doesn\u2019t immediately raise red flags regarding race as a risk factor in most contexts.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. A single prior offense could indicate some past behavior issues but might not be severe enough on its own to classify him as high risk unless it's a violent crime or multiple offenses.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, weight 140 lbs. He\u2019s living alone, which could suggest independence but may also imply he's managing his circumstances without supervision, potentially indicating responsibility issues.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, showing some educational drive and commitment to personal development. That might indicate a lower risk compared to someone with fewer resources or opportunities.\n\nHe\u2019s employed one job during the year. Employment usually correlates with stability and lower recidivism rates, so that's positive for low risk.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it's recent or if there are behavioral changes, but since he only admitted to using marijuana and hasn't specified more severe drug issues, it might not be as concerning unless there's a history of substance abuse leading to other problems.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That suggests a stable family environment initially, which is generally protective against later criminal behavior or risk factors.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate secularism or a lack of religious support, but without more context on how this affects his behavior or relationships, it's hard to assess as a standalone risk factor. Some people align well with this belief and might not have issues, while others could experience significant stress or anxiety.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest doesn't typically correlate strongly with high risk unless it's violent. His education and employment are positive indicators of stability. The drug use is minimal (only marijuana in the past four years), so that\u2019s a low to moderate risk factor. Family background at a young age suggests some stability, but his secular views might be a concern if they lead to emotional issues or neglect.\n\nHowever, considering all these factors together, I don't see a strong indication of high risk. He seems to have manageable issues without severe tendencies towards criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
