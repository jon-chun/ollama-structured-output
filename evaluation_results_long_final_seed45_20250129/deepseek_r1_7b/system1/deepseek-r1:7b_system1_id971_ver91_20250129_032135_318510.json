    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. I need to determine if the risk factors given indicate a high risk for something\u2014probably criminal recidivism or another type of risk. The person is a 21-year-old male, White, with one prior arrest and a conviction. He's 5'7\" and 140 lbs. No married status, living alone. He has a GED and is in college, which might indicate some level of education but also perhaps instability. He's employed one job recently.\n\nHe's used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years, so that's a substance abuse issue. In the last month, he felt really down and couldn't find comfort, which could suggest deeper emotional issues or low self-esteem. At 18, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014so he experienced some early family challenges.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God regarding his personal life, so that might indicate secularism or a lack of religious support for coping. Maybe this leads to more independence but perhaps also feelings of isolation since he's living alone without a support system.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a prior criminal record, which is a red flag. Substance abuse and emotional distress are also significant risk factors. His current educational pursuits (GED and college) might suggest some proactive steps but could also mean instability if not managed well. The lack of marital status and living alone without support could amplify stress and substance use issues.\n\nThe urban environment where he lived with his mother might provide a sense of stability, but now being away from family in an urban setting while living alone could lead to isolation. His belief system might affect how he deals with life's challenges, potentially leading to healthier coping mechanisms or vice versa.\n\nConsidering all these factors: Prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of past behavior that could predict future issues. Substance abuse is another major risk factor. Emotional distress adds to the instability, especially if it's compounded by living alone without support. The lack of religious belief might not directly contribute but could influence his coping mechanisms in ways that might either help or hinder.\n\nGiven these points, I think this person has a high risk for further issues\u2014maybe reoffending, further substance abuse, or emotional distress. So the prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
