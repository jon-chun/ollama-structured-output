The person is White, hasn't been married, lives alone, has a GED and is in college, worked one job, used marijuana in the past four years, felt really down recently, lived with his mother at age, and doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, his age of 21 suggests he's still developing socially and emotionally. Living alone increases isolation risk. His drug use (marijuana) might indicate substance abuse issues, which can affect mood and relationships.\n\nHe has a GED but is in college, so education seems good. However, his recent feelings of low mood could be related to depression or anxiety, influenced by living with his mother at a young age without religious support.\n\nConsidering all factors: he's young, substance use, isolation, emotional issues, past convictions, and lack of religious belief. These points together suggest a high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
