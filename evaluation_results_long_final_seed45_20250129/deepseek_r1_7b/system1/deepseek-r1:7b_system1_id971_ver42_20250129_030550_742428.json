    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag immediately because past convictions can indicate previous behavior issues or legal trouble that might affect his ability to be a responsible adult.\n\nHis demographic info: White, male, age 21. Not sure if race plays a big role here unless there's some systemic factor, but not enough info on that yet.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. GED can sometimes indicate some educational background issues or maybe limited opportunities, but he's proactive by going to college. That might be a positive sign as he could seek better opportunities.\n\nWeight: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. That's below average weight for his height. Could be related to health issues like diabetes or heart problems, which can contribute to risk factors if not addressed.\n\nLiving alone: No kids, single, living independently. He has never been married but is currently single. Not sure how that ties into risk, maybe it's more about personal stability rather than risk itself.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use can have severe consequences on relationships, family life, and overall well-being. If he's using now, it might indicate ongoing issues or a lack of support system.\n\n feelings of low mood: He felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This could be linked to depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors on their own.\n\nFamily background: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might suggest exposure to certain environments or potential family dynamics, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact on his current behavior or risk.\n\nReligion: He doesn't consider God as part of his life. This could affect his personal motivation and relationships, potentially leading to isolation if not addressed through other means like community involvement.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is a strong indicator of past issues, which can predict future behavior problems. Drug use and low mood are direct signs of current mental health struggles. Being in college might mitigate some negative aspects, but the arrest record and drug use are major red flags. Considering he's 21, it's early to judge, but these factors do lean towards higher risk.\n\nI think his overall risk is high because of past legal issues, ongoing substance abuse, and potential mental health challenges. His education might help him change trajectory, but the present circumstances suggest a need for closer monitoring.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
