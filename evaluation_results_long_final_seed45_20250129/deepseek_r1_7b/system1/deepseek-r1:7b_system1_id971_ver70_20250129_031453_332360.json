    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise concerns about risk but could be relevant in understanding his background or possible community ties.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted.Conviction history can indicate past behavior issues which might correlate with higher risk for future offenses or substance use problems.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs, which isn't particularly concerning unless there's an associated health issue, but nothing is mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently can sometimes indicate a certain level of responsibility, but it also might suggest he hasn't established personal connections or support systems that could aid in positive outcomes.\n\nHe has a GED and is attending college. Education is generally a positive factor as it can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability, which are associated with lower risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Single employment might contribute to financial instability if he faces challenges or relies heavily on that income source.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt very down for part of the month. Drug use can have serious mental health implications, including potential substance abuse disorders which can increase risk of other issues like accidents or violence.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't influence what happens personally, suggesting he views life as a series of random events without personal control over outcomes. This could relate to his mindset on facing challenges and might contribute to higher risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe was raised in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area. That environment could have influences such as family dynamics or exposure to certain community issues, which may not directly impact risk but contextually aware.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past criminal history (conviction), single job, education and attending college, current substance use (marijuana), and belief in random events without control might suggest he is at a higher risk for further substance abuse or antisocial behaviors. While some mitigating factors like education are present, the drug use and lack of strong personal connections could offset those benefits.\n\nTherefore, I would rate this as high risk with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
