    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but still considered at risk. He's white, but race doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are systemic issues, which I don't have data on here.\n\nHe has a single arrest and one conviction. That suggests some past involvement with the system, which might indicate criminal tendencies or unstable home environment.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight is around the lower end of average; not sure how that affects risk without more info like BMI or body fat percentage.\n\nNot married and living alone. Living arrangements can sometimes be linked to higher risk due to lack of support, but it also depends on other factors.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level is positive as it often correlates with better opportunities and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe's held one job recently, which might suggest he's somewhat stable or seeking better employment, which could be a good sign.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't had issues in the last month. However, recent drug use can sometimes indicate potential for continued substance abuse affecting his ability to function.\n\nHis mood: He feels down and can't find cheer during the past month. This might suggest underlying mental health issues or stressors that could affect his behavior or decision-making.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That suggests he was raised in a different environment from his father, which could have various implications on his behavior and relationships.\n\nBelief that God has no role: This is a strong indicator of potential existential crisis or lack of religious support, which can affect self-esteem and decision-making, possibly leading to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, despite some positive factors like education and living in college, the key red flags are past drug use, living with his mother (possible unstable home), and his belief system. The lack of marriage and single status might not be enough on its own. So I think this indicates a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
