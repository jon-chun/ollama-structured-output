    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 21 is typically early adulthood, which might be associated with higher risk-taking behavior compared to younger individuals but lower than adults. Being White doesn't directly indicate high risk without other context.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction can increase risk of reoffending, so that's a positive sign towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs, which seems within a normal range for his age. No immediate association with risk based on this factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like isolation leading to substance use or stress.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having alternative education can sometimes correlate with lower risk of certain negative behaviors, though it's not directly related to risk assessment here.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Job stability might influence his ability to maintain consistent behavior patterns, but holding a job isn't necessarily indicative of high risk on its own.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Substance use can be associated with various risks and is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so this is a significant factor pointing towards high risk.\n\nDuring some of the past month, he felt extremely down and couldn't find cheer. This deep depression or mood swings could indicate underlying mental health issues, which are strong indicators of high risk as they can contribute to self-harm or suicide attempts.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Family environment, especially at a young age and in an urban setting, might influence behavior and risk factors without additional context.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life. This lack of religious support could lead to feelings of isolation or existential despair, which are often associated with high-risk behaviors like substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior conviction, substance use (marijuana), current mood state indicating potential depression, and family environment issues all point towards a high risk. Additionally, his age being early adulthood might mean he's more susceptible to negative influences without further context on support systems.\n\nTherefore, the overall assessment is that this individual indicates a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
