    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with this risk assessment query about determining if certain factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through the provided information step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises concerns about criminal history. Convictions are typically strong indicators of past problematic behavior that could impact future stability.\n\nHe's described as having a GED and currently enrolled in college. While education can be positive, it's also possible he might lack motivation if he's not getting support or help to succeed academically. His living situation is alone, which is generally safer than shared living with potential issues like alcohol use or drug abuse.\n\nHe's never been married but is living independently, so that's another point towards safety. His past four years include using marijuana, and during the last month he felt exceptionally down, which suggests mood swings or emotional instability\u2014potential signs of underlying mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That environment might have had its own challenges, possibly contributing to current behaviors if there's family dysfunction or lack of support.\n\nLastly, he doesn't consider God as part of his personal life, which could indicate a lack of spiritual guidance and potential coping mechanisms for stress or emotional distress.\n\nPutting all this together: past criminal history, possible underlying mental health issues due to recent mood swings, lack of stable living environment contributing to drug use, and emotional distress from early family experiences. All these factors point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
