    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual described. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age is relatively young, so maybe not directly a high risk unless there are other factors. No specific issues related to his background immediately come to mind.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction can be a significant factor in risk assessment. Convictions, especially for non-violent crimes like drug use or unemployment, might increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight is 140 lbs. No immediate concerns here; body type isn't typically a direct indicator unless there's something about his appearance that suggests health issues, but nothing stands out.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because it may lead to loneliness or isolation, which are known contributors to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level can affect future stability and willingness to engage in risky behaviors. Having ongoing education might suggest he's motivated towards positive change but could also indicate lower risk if not actively involved in risky activities.\n\nHe held one job during the year, which suggests some employability. Job involvement usually reduces recidivism risk compared to those who are unemployed or have multiple gaps in employment history.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) within the past four years and felt down for parts of the last month. Drug use can increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors like criminal activity, especially if it's a gateway drug leading to more serious substance abuse.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area could have both positive and negative implications. Urban environments often have higher crime rates but might also offer opportunities for better education or employment. However, living with an older person doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are other factors like neglect or abuse that aren't mentioned.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal events. This attitude could be associated with a lack of religious support and might influence his willingness to seek help or remain in a dangerous environment.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, drug use, living alone, and a negative belief system are all factors that can increase the risk of reoffending. The presence of a GED and ongoing education could mitigate some risk but isn't enough if other factors are present. Considering the individual's age, he might still be in a phase where he hasn't fully transitioned out of risk-taking behaviors.\n\nTherefore, these factors suggest a high risk. I'll rate it with 75% confidence since while there are mitigating factors like education and living circumstances, the presence of prior arrest, drug use, and personal beliefs lean towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
