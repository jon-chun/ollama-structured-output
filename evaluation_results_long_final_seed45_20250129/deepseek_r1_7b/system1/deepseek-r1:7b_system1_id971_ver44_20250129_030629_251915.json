    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk. First, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. That doesn't immediately raise red flags about his riskiness. He's been arrested once and convicted, which might suggest some past behavior issues, but only one conviction.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Those stats alone don't tell me much about his risk unless there's something about his weight management or health related to his risk, but I don't see that here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a sign of instability, maybe social isolation which could lead to higher risk factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, so he's likely pursuing better opportunities, which might indicate self-motivation for improvement but doesn't necessarily mean low risk if he's still struggling with other areas.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unemployment spells can be tough, especially if it affects his ability to support himself or pay bills, leading to further instability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a red flag because even if he's just experimenting, it can lead to substance abuse problems and potential legal issues again.\n\nHe felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests possible depression or some form of emotional distress, which are serious mental health indicators linked to higher risk for various issues like re-offending or family dysfunction.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might indicate a lack of family support or emotional neglect, which can contribute to behavioral problems and substance abuse later on.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be a sign of spirituality or religious disconnection, which might affect his mental health or social interactions but again, not directly indicative unless it leads to other issues like isolation.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is low, but the factors pointing towards possible drug use (marijuana), emotional distress, living with an unstable family background, and perhaps lack of support from religion could increase the risk. These might contribute enough to consider him high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
