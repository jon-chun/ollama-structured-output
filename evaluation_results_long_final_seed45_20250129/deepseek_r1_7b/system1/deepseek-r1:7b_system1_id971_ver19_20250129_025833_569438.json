    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being young might reduce risk, but other factors could influence this.\n\nHe has one arrest and a prior conviction. One offense isn't severe, but it's still a negative point.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk unless there's an indicator like BMI, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone.\u5355\u8eab\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u591a\u5927\u3002\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can sometimes be protective, but it depends on the field of study or how he's using it.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Employment usually reduces risk compared to being unemployed.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before but only recently felt down. Past use might indicate substance abuse issues, which could be a red flag.\n\nHis mental state: He feels down sometimes and nothing cheers him up. This could relate to depression or anxiety, both significant mental health issues that can increase risk.\n\nHe was a minor in an urban household of three with his biological mother. Living with an unstable family at a young age might have long-term effects on behavior and stability.\n\nReligious disbelief: He doesn't see God as affecting his personal life. This could relate to substance abuse or neglecting mental health, which are linked to higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of positive factors like education and being in college but several negative indicators. The drug use and emotional state seem concerning. The young age might not be the strongest protective factor here. So overall, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
