    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That's relatively young, so maybe not immediately concerning. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction, which suggests some past involvement but doesn't necessarily indicate current behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are average\u2014nothing jumps out as abnormal there. He's living alone, which is common for someone of his age. No family issues mentioned since he hasn't been married or had children.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, indicating some level of education and commitment to furthering his knowledge. Only one job during the year might suggest limited income stability, but it could also mean he's actively seeking employment.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down recently. This could be a sign of ongoing substance abuse issues. Substance abuse can affect mental health and behavior, increasing risk factors.\n\nFeeling down for extended periods might indicate mood issues or depression, which are significant concerning recidivism. It's also possible he's struggling with mental health beyond just short-term feelings.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area could have both positive and negative influences. Urban environments can offer opportunities but may also expose him to stressors. His belief that God doesn't intervene suggests he might not seek religious support, which could be isolated or lack of spiritual guidance.\n\nCombining these factors: past criminal history, substance use, mood issues, and isolation from family/religion points towards a higher risk profile. The presence of multiple warning signs should lead to at least a moderately high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
