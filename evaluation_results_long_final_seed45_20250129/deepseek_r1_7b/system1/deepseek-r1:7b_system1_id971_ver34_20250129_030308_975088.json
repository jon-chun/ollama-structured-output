    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. First, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags. Convictions, especially at such a young age, can be concerning.\n\nHe's described as 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't seem to add up for someone of his height; maybe it's a typo or just not relevant here. His living situation is alone, which might indicate some instability but isn't directly linked to risk unless there are issues with that environment.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's motivated to improve himself educationally. That's a positive sign because educational attainment can reduce recidivism rates. He's only held one job during the year; joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other unstable environments, but again, not directly tied.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt very down recently. Substance use, especially if it's part of a larger pattern, is a risk factor. The recent mood, feeling \"so down,\" could indicate underlying issues that might lead to self-harm or more serious behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area suggests he was raised by family, but the mention that God doesn't have anything to do with his life is significant. It indicates a lack of religious support and possible spirituality, which can affect mental health and self-esteem, increasing risk factors for mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these points: a past conviction, substance use, living situation alone (though not specified as problematic), and lack of religious support, I would lean towards high risk despite some mitigating factors like education and being in college. The main concerns here are the recent substance use and potential underlying mental health issues due to his upbringing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, my prediction is YES with a confidence level around 60% because while there are some positive aspects, the risk factors present strongly suggest he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
