    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. While race can influence recidivism rates, it's not always a direct indicator. At this young age with only one prior arrest and a conviction, the impact might be minimal compared to older individuals with more convictions.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's actively seeking education and may have better opportunities ahead. This positive attribute could lower his risk as he's not likely to revert to previous behaviors easily.\n\nHis weight is 5'7\" and 140 lbs. While this isn't an immediate red flag, combined with other factors like drug use history, it might indicate some health concerns that could affect behavior or substance use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living independently can sometimes reduce dependency on substances since he doesn't have a support system to turn to when things get tough. However, this also means he might not seek help when needed.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is noted. While marijuana use isn't as severe as other drug uses like alcohol or cocaine, it still shows substance dependency. This could impact his ability to function and maintain relationships, increasing risk.\n\nHis feelings of low mood for much of the month might indicate underlying mental health issues. Depression or anxiety can significantly affect behavior and decision-making, making him a higher risk factor overall.\n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area could have shaped his upbringing. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and social stressors that can contribute to risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nHis lack of religious affiliation might mean he doesn't have support or guidance from a faith community, which is crucial for maintaining stability and positive values.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior arrest and conviction (1 each), GED, living independently but with some drug use history, low mood, urban living at a young age without religious support. These points collectively increase the risk assessment. The presence of substance use issues and potential underlying mental health conditions are strong indicators of higher risk.\n\nGiven all this, I would assess this individual as having a high risk, so my prediction is \"YES\" with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
