    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions are usually indicators of past issues which could affect his ability to make good decisions now.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which shows he's educated but also indicates he might not have the same level of support as someone with more resources. His lack of a traditional job (he's got a GED and maybe working part-time or trying to get a full-time job) could mean instability, which can lead to higher risk.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone without support from family or friends can increase stress and isolation, both of which are risk factors. Plus, not being married might affect his stability in personal relationships, though that's more about future outcomes than immediate risk.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana in the past four years and some recent substance use during the last month. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor because it can lead to further instability, legal issues, and health problems which might affect his ability to manage daily life or make responsible decisions.\n\nHe felt down for much of the last month, so he's experiencing emotional distress. This could impact his decision-making abilities and overall well-being, increasing the likelihood of negative outcomes.\n\nAt a young age (21) he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This early-life exposure might have had some adverse effects on his development or family dynamics, potentially contributing to higher risk behavior later on.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could affect his emotional support system and spiritual coping mechanisms, which are important for managing stress and maintaining positive relationships.\n\nPutting all this together: prior conviction (high), GED in college (moderate), no marriage/living alone (moderate), drug use (high risk), recent emotional distress (high), early-life family situation (moderate), and lack of spiritual support (moderate). \n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk seems to be high. I'd give him a prediction of YES with confidence around 85% because multiple significant risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
