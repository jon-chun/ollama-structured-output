Let's break down the factors.\n\nFirst, he's white and has been arrested once with a conviction. That's one arrest; not super high risk but something to note. His height and weight don't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married\u2014maybe independent, which is positive, but alone can sometimes indicate potential issues. His GED and college enrollment suggest he's working on his education, which might mean he's motivated to change things.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. That could be concerning because drug use often correlates with other risky behaviors or unstable home environments. Plus, he felt down a lot recently; that might indicate underlying issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nAt 18, living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014could be part of a troubled family environment. That might contribute to behavioral issues or lack of support system.\n\nHe believes God has no role in his life. This could mean he's searching for meaning elsewhere, which might affect his decision-making and relationships.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest with a conviction, some drug use, recent negative mood, and a potentially unstable family background. These factors suggest moderate risk but not high. Maybe 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
