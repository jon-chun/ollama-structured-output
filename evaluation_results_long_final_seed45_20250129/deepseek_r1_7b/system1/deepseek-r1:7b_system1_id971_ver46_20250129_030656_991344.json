He's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because criminal history can predict future behavior.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. That's on the lighter side, but weight alone doesn't determine risk. His living situation is solitary, so he might be somewhat isolated or struggling with social connections. He has a GED and is in college, which suggests some level of education and maybe self-motivation.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone; that could indicate past instability or lack of support system. Using marijuana in the past four years shows drug use history, but he also mentions feeling down for much of the past month. That persistent mood issue might point towards deeper emotional issues or substance abuse impacting his life.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's a different environment from where he is now living, so there could be adjustments that affected him negatively. Additionally, his belief that God has no role in his personal events might suggest a lack of spiritual support or coping mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, drug use, emotional state, living situation, and lack of religious involvement\u2014I think this person does present high risk. The combination of past substance abuse, unstable living conditions, and personal beliefs could contribute to future issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
