    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's good to note. He has one prior arrest and a conviction. A single prior offense can be significant, especially if it's a serious crime, but since we don't know what that was, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't seem out of the ordinary; no cause for concern here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his behavior or risk level. \n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having educational goals suggests he's motivated, which could be positive but might also indicate if there are underlying issues affecting his studies.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Unemployment for long periods can lead to dependency, so having a job shows some stability.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt very down recently. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential behavioral issues and could relate to mental health concerns.\n\nHis young age (21) living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area suggests he might have experienced neglect or abuse, which can contribute to risky behaviors if not properly addressed. His belief that God doesn't affect his personal life could indicate a lack of spiritual support and potential emotional issues.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors like prior arrest, drug use, small household environment, and lack of religious support seem to point towards high risk. I would rate my confidence in these indicators as 85% because while there are some mitigating factors like being in college, the combination of multiple risk indicators suggests a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
