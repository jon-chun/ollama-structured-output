    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with reoffending. So that's definitely a YES with high confidence.\n\nHis race is White. I know there's some disparity in the criminal justice system regarding sentencing based on race, but without more context like his previous convictions or socioeconomic background, it's hard to definitively link race to risk here. However, since he has other risk factors, this might not tip the scale alone.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight can be a factor in recidivism studies sometimes, but at 21, maybe he's still developing. Not sure how much weight matters here without more info.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014maybe indicative of some underlying issues or instability, which could contribute to risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can be a protective factor if it leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. But he's also only held one job, so maybe not as strong here.\n\nUsed drugs past four years but recently marijuana in the past month. Drug use can increase risk of substance abuse, which in turn affects mental health and risk behaviors. Plus, recent drug use might mean he's more susceptible to triggers.\n\nHe felt down for most of the past month\u2014possible signs of depression or anxiety. These mental health issues often predict higher recidivism rates.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's concerning because living in such environments is linked to higher crime rates and family dysfunction, which can be risk factors.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life\u2014this indicates a lack of religious support, which might mean he lacks a strong support system, increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high risk), substance use (moderate), living conditions (high), lack of marriage and family (moderate), recent drug use (high), possible mental health issues (moderate), and a belief in no higher power (moderate). The strongest indicators are the prior arrest, living situation, and recent substance use. So overall, high risk with confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
