    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. This alone raises some alarm because prior convictions can be indicators of past behavior that might affect future actions.\n\nHis physical characteristics are average height and weight, which doesn't immediately raise concerns unless combined with other factors. He's unmarried and living alone, which could suggest he's in a different social environment than usual, but it depends on his circumstances.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, indicating some level of education and commitment to furthering his skills or degree. This might be positive as higher education can correlate with better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates, but it also means he's actively working towards improving himself.\n\nHe's employed only once during the past year. Employment stability can be a factor in risk assessment because consistently working individuals often have better support systems and less time to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years, which is somewhat common but could indicate substance abuse issues. During the past month, he felt down and couldn't cope with positive emotions, which might point towards mood disorders or emotional instability, both of which can affect risk behavior.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in an urban area suggests he was brought up in a non-traditional environment. Growing up in such circumstances can sometimes lead to behavioral issues but doesn't automatically correlate with high risk without more context.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might influence his coping mechanisms and support system, potentially leading him to rely on other factors for happiness or stress relief, which could contribute to risky behaviors if those systems aren't functioning properly.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior conviction is a red flag. The drug use and emotional distress during the past month add to the risk profile. His young age might mean he's still developing coping strategies, which could be less effective than in adulthood. While his GED and college enrollment are positive aspects, the number of factors pointing towards potential instability or emotional strain should weigh enough to indicate high risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%. It's not an extremely high probability, but there are significant warning signs that suggest he could be at risk for further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
