    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being young might reduce risk, but it can also depend on other factors. His single arrest and previous conviction don't immediately jump out as extremely concerning unless it's multiple severe convictions.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs\u2014nothing unusual here. He's never married and living alone, which could be a red flag for substance abuse or isolation issues, but again, depends on other factors.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's motivated to improve his situation. That\u2019s positive, so maybe not a high risk there.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year\u2014consistent work can contribute positively, but it's also possible he's facing challenges elsewhere.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. This could indicate substance abuse issues, which is concerning.\n\nHis recent emotional state\u2014he feels down a lot lately\u2014suggests possible mood issues or stress. That\u2019s another red flag for mental health concerns.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area might have some underlying issues, possibly related to family dynamics or environment that could impact his current behavior.\n\nFinally, he doesn't believe in God personally, which might lead him to a nihilistic outlook. This can sometimes be linked to substance abuse and lack of motivation for positive change.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are some concerning factors like drug use and emotional state, the presence of a GED and college enrollment mitigates some risk. The single arrest and living alone don't immediately point towards high risk unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
