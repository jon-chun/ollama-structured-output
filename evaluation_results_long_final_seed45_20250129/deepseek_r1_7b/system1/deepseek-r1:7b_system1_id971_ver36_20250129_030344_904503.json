    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. Racial factors can influence outcomes, but without specific data on how race correlates with recidivism in this population, it might not be the most significant factor here unless there are known statistics to support it.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is a red flag because it shows he has struggled with the law before, which can affect his ability to reintegrate successfully into society.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. That's on the lower end of adult men, but body weight isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless there are health issues or history of violence associated with it, which I don't see here.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to emotional distress. He's currently in college, which shows some level of commitment and education, but he has only held one job during the year. This indicates inconsistency or perhaps difficulty finding steady employment, which could impact his motivation and stability.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, so that suggests he's motivated to further his education. However, the fact that he only has one job makes me wonder about his financial situation and ability to provide for himself while living alone.\n\nHis substance use: he used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. While marijuana isn't as harmful as other substances, chronic drug use can affect cognitive function, mood, and relationships, all of which might contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\nHe feels that God has no impact on his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or a belief in determinism, which might affect his decision-making and overall well-being.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Parenting challenges at a young age can lead to emotional issues later on, affecting his relationships, stability, and perhaps substance use patterns.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior arrest, living alone, limited job experience, current educational status, possible drug use, and personal beliefs about God's role. These elements might indicate moderate to high risk for reoffending or experiencing instability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
