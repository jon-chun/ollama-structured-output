    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age might not be directly indicative, but being young could mean he's still developing and perhaps more prone to certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a arrest history with one conviction. One prior offense suggests past criminal behavior which can impact risk assessment.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. No immediate red flags here, but weight might be relevant if combined with other factors like drug use or living situation.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors as there's no one to deter him from risky actions.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. This indicates some level of education and commitment, which might mitigate risk if he's motivated to change his behavior.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other unstable behaviors.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana before but hasn't done so in the past four years. However, recent feelings of low mood for an extended period could indicate a possible slip up or ongoing struggles with mental health.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of three suggests he was raised in a multi-person setting, which might influence his behavior compared to living alone now.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal life indicates he may not seek support from religious communities, potentially missing out on accountability or positive influences.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some risk factors like prior arrest and living alone, the positive aspects like education, current job, and lack of active drug use might lower the overall risk. However, considering the subjective feelings about mood and his belief system could increase vulnerability to more negative behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
