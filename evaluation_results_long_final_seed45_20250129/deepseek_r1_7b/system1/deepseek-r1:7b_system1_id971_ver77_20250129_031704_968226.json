    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. At this age, he might be entering the workforce or further education, which could have different implications on his stability and support network.\n\nHe has one arrest and a prior conviction. While one conviction can be significant, especially if it's for a serious offense, having a prior conviction does carry some risk factors related to\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u6216previous criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 140 lbs. Not sure how this affects risk assessment, but maybe relates to potential substance use or physical health issues, though it's not directly linked here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might lead him to turn to other substances for comfort, especially during stressful times when he feels down.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having educational credentials is positive as it often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability, but his current enrollment suggests he's committed to improving himself.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Single job can be a double-edged sword; while it provides income, unemployment or underemployment might lead to stress and substance use as coping mechanisms.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is mentioned. Substance abuse, especially marijuana, could affect his cognitive function, relationships, and mental health. It's concerning because even occasional use can have long-term effects.\n\nHe felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. Persistent feelings of depression or low mood are serious indicators of mental health issues, which can significantly impact risk behavior and decision-making.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This might suggest exposure to family dynamics or social environment, but it doesn't immediately indicate high risk unless there's evidence of abuse or neglect.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious support could affect his coping mechanisms and relationships, potentially leading him to turn to other substances or sources of comfort.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior conviction, current substance use (marijuana), persistent low mood, living alone, and a possible lack of strong family support. These elements point towards high risk because they suggest instability, mental health issues, and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
