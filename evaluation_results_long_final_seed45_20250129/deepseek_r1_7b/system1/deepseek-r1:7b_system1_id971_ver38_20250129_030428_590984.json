    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not be directly related but is worth noting as part of his background.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. One prior offense can sometimes correlate with recidivism, so that's something to consider.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem to indicate any health issues or substance abuse, which could be relevant if there were other factors, but here they're not directly linked.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living solitarily might suggest he's not in a stable environment, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is attending college. Having educational credentials often shows responsibility and pursuit of improvement, which might reduce risk if he's committed to personal development.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Unemployment for that long could indicate instability or difficulty finding gainful work.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the last month feeling down and not able to cope. This could be a sign of ongoing substance abuse issues, which is a high-risk indicator if it's frequent or severe.\n\nHis early life was in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area. That might suggest he has a somewhat stable background but could also indicate exposure to certain influences that might affect his current behavior or mental health.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life, which might point towards religious disaffinity or spirituality issues, potentially affecting his motivation and relationships, possibly increasing risk factors like isolation or emotional distress.\n\nPutting it all together: The one prior arrest and conviction are concerning. Drug use history is significant, especially if it's leading to feelings of low mood and inability to cope. His current living situation might not be ideal, and his early background could indicate some stressors. However, he has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's proactive about improving himself.\n\nThe one job doesn't seem stable since he's only held it for a year. His feelings of low mood and helplessness could stem from various issues, possibly related to substance abuse or lack of support. The urban environment might offer more opportunities but also more stressors if not managed well.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are some mitigating points like education and attempting college, the presence of a prior conviction, ongoing drug use, and potential emotional distress seem to indicate that this individual is at high risk. The combination of these could predict a higher likelihood of reoffending or experiencing instability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
