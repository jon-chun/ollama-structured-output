    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age is usually a minor factor unless it suggests immaturity or criminal responsibility issues, which don't seem to be the case here. His GED and college enrollment indicate some level of education and commitment to furthering his education, which are positive traits that might reduce risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor because prior convictions can increase risk scores; however, it depends on how severe or numerous they are. Since he has only one conviction, maybe the impact isn't as severe, but it still adds to the risk pool.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs at 5'7''. Not sure about his BMI here, but weight alone doesn't directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or living conditions.\n\nLiving alone is a concern because living in a single room can increase feelings of isolation and loneliness. His current mood, feeling down for some time without any cheering, could be linked to this living situation. Sadness or depression might be present due to low income, lack of support network, or unsatisfying job as indicated by him working only one job.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood. Drug use can contribute to mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which are risk factors. His current state of mind suggests he might be struggling with mental health issues, which is a red flag.\n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area could have had some stressors or environment issues that might impact him now. It's possible there was neglect or abuse, but without more information, it's speculative.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal life indicates a potential lack of spirituality or faith, which might influence his coping mechanisms for stress and mood swings. Without religious support, he might rely on other sources, some of which could be unhealthy if they contribute to drug use or self-harm thoughts.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior arrest (moderate risk), single job (positive but maybe low stability), living alone (increased isolation), recent drug use and mood issues (negative indicators), and a brief mention of past abuse in a small household. The presence of mood issues, drug use, and living alone are strong indicators that could push the risk to \"YES\" if other factors aren't mitigating it.\n\nI think these factors collectively suggest a high risk because they point towards potential substance abuse, mental health issues, and unstable living conditions which can lead to recidivism. So, I'll lean toward \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
