    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male who was arrested once and convicted. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White, which doesn't directly indicate high risk but might be considered in terms of potential biases or societal impacts. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, so that's a significant risk factor on its own because past convictions can predict future behavior issues.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they don't provide much information about his behavior or risk level. Similarly, his marital status is single living alone, which might suggest some stress factors but isn't directly tied to criminal risk unless there's unaddressed social issues elsewhere.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which usually indicates some level of education and stability. However, having educational attainment can sometimes be protective against recidivism if he's using it to improve his situation. But since he's enrolled in college, that might not directly correlate with high risk unless there are other issues.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Unemployment or limited work experience could contribute to dependency issues and substance abuse, which ties into his drug use history. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential for further issues, both personal and legal.\n\nHis drug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana, can be a sign of recklessness and possible underlying mental health issues. The fact that he felt down for some time and nothing could cheer him up might point towards depression or anxiety, which are serious mental health concerns that can affect behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three suggests potential family dynamics issues. Young people often experience challenging family environments, which can lead to behavioral problems if not addressed properly. However, without more context on the family environment, it's hard to gauge its direct impact on risk.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his personal behavior and mental health. If he feels disconnected from a higher power, that could correlate with other negative traits like drug use or lack of motivation for positive change.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, which is red flags. His current substance abuse, especially if it's ongoing, along with possible mental health issues, could increase the risk. The fact that he's 21 might mean he's still in a phase where he's experimenting and not yet established life skills, but his past actions don't necessarily predict future behavior unless there are mitigating factors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think this person does have high risk tendencies due to his criminal history, substance abuse, possible mental health issues, and young age. His education and living situation might be protective in some ways, but the overall profile leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
