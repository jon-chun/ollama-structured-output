    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk and then respond with a JSON object specifying \"YES\" or \"NO\" for prediction and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, let's go through each risk factor one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: He is 21 years old. Young age might be associated with higher recidivism rates as he may not have developed life skills yet.\n   \n2. **Race**: He identifies as White. Generally, racial factors can influence recidivism but in this case, it's specific to him, so maybe less impactful.\n\n3. **Arrests and Convictions**: He has been arrested once and convicted. One prior offense is a moderate risk indicator.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Not sure if height or weight directly influence risk here, but it's noted as part of the data.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: He is not married and living alone. Living arrangement could affect support system which might influence behavior and risk.\n\n6. **Education Level**: He has a GED and is in college. Higher education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, but it's variable based on other factors like motivation or environment.\n\n7. **Employment**: He held one job during the year. Employment can provide stability, so this might be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some time recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to risky behaviors or self-harm, increasing risk.\n\n9. **Past Household Environment**: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Small households might offer more supervision but also could be isolating if unsupportive.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: He doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life. This might indicate lack of religious support or belief which can impact decision-making related to risk factors.\n\nNow, considering all these points:\n\n- Drug use (marijuana) is a red flag indicating potential substance abuse issues.\n- Living with an unsupportive household could contribute to negative behaviors.\n- A single prior conviction also adds to the risk.\n- Age being 21 may be in a phase where he hasn't yet developed protective factors.\n\nGiven these, while there are some mitigating factors like education and employment, the presence of substance abuse (marijuana) and possible influence from the household environment could significantly increase the risk. Therefore, I would lean towards high risk with a confidence level of around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
