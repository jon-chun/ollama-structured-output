    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being young might not directly correlate to high risk, but it could relate to recidivism rates in certain contexts. However, age alone isn't a strong indicator here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a history of criminal behavior, which is a red flag for potential reoffending. Recidivism is more likely among those with a prior conviction.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in risk assessment, but without knowing his BMI or body composition, it's hard to say. However, since he has a GED and is attending college, maybe he's motivated to change things.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like instability in the home environment. Since he has educational goals, perhaps he can seek support.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. A GED can sometimes be a stepping stone to better opportunities, so this might lower his risk compared to someone without any formal education.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment history isn't the strongest indicator of risk, but it does show some stability. If he has a job, that usually indicates responsibility and financial independence.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. That could be problematic if it's recent or if he's using it regularly. The mention of feeling down for parts of the month might indicate underlying mental health issues, which is a serious concern.\n\nHe felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This could point towards depression or another mental disorder, both of which are significant risk factors in terms of behavior and future criminality.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area might suggest exposure to certain environments or potential family issues. However, without more context on the family's stability or any adverse events there, it's hard to gauge fully.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he may be experiencing some degree of existential crisis or searching for meaning elsewhere. This could impact his decision-making and relationships, increasing risk in certain situations.\n\nPutting this all together: A prior arrest, potential drug use issues, and mental health concerns are all strong indicators of high risk. The other factors don't necessarily mitigate these risks unless there's evidence to suggest he's making efforts to improve or has support systems.\n\nTherefore, I'd lean towards a \"YES\" with high confidence because multiple risk factors point towards a higher likelihood of reoffending or problematic behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
