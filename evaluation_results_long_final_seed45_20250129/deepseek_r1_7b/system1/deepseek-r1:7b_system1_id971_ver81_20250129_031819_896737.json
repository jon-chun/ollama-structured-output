    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White descent. Age is typically not a strong indicator unless it's associated with higher crime rates in certain contexts, but at this age, it might be less relevant.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior arrest could indicate some level of criminal history, which can sometimes be a red flag. The conviction itself suggests he has been involved in the legal system before.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight is 140 lbs. These factors alone don't usually predict risk unless they're associated with other issues like substance abuse or health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can be a red flag for various reasons, such as higher risk of isolation, which might lead to more serious behavior or substance use.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Having a high school diploma equivalent suggests he may have some educational drive but could also indicate that he's looking to get better opportunities, which might be a protective factor against reoffending.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can contribute to higher risk behaviors or substance use, so this is something to consider.\n\nDrug use: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and admitted to feeling down for parts of the past month. Drug use, especially recent, can be a significant risk factor as it may lead to substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis history indicates he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such circumstances could have long-term effects on his behavior, mental health, or family relationships, potentially increasing risk factors like anxiety, depression, or unstable family dynamics.\n\nLastly, he states that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This lack of religious involvement can sometimes be associated with coping mechanisms and might influence his personal growth or support system, possibly contributing to higher risk behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: The single prior arrest could be a risk factor, but the significant factors are drug use (both history and recent admission) and living in an urban environment with a potentially unstable family background. These points suggest he is at moderate to high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
