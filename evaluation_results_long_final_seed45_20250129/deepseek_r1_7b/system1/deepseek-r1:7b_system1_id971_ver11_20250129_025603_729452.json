    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White descent. Age is typically not a strong indicator on its own, but combined with other factors it could play a role. He has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is significant because it shows he has faced legal issues before, which can impact his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. While weight can be a factor in some contexts like substance use, without additional info on BMI or body fat percentage, it's hard to assess here. His height is below average but not extremely so. He hasn't been married and is living alone, which might indicate he's more independent, but perhaps there could be social support gaps.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, showing some educational pursuit despite prior legal issues. Education can sometimes correlate with better job opportunities or higher self-esteem. He held one job during the year; having previous work experience suggests some financial stability and discipline.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the last month he felt very down. This could indicate recent substance use, which is a red flag for other drug or alcohol issues. He admitted to using drugs but doesn't specify other substances like alcohol.\n\nHis mental health history isn't directly addressed except that he's had feelings of low mood over the past month. If this is consistent, it might suggest underlying mental health issues that could contribute to risk behaviors or substance use.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Co-residing with a parent can provide support and stability, but being in an urban setting might have its own challenges related to crime or social environment.\n\nLastly, he believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious affiliation could affect his moral compass or coping mechanisms for stress, which might influence risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: A prior arrest is a negative factor, but the presence of a GED and ongoing education mitigates some risk. However, factors like recent drug use, potential mental health issues, and living in an urban environment without support could increase the risk. Additionally, self-identified lack of religious involvement might not be directly a risk factor but can be related to other personal issues.\n\nConsidering these points, I would rate this individual as having a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
