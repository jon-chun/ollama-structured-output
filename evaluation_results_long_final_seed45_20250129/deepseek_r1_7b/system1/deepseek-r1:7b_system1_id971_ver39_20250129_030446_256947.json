    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That alone isn't a strong indicator unless there are other factors pointing towards higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted.Conviction history does suggest some past involvement with the law, which could be a risk factor, but it's not the most significant on its own.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. This information might relate to other factors like substance use or health issues, but without additional context, it's hard to assess directly as a risk indicator.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of higher risk due to potential social isolation, but again, this depends on other factors like prior antisocial behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Educational attainment typically correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually reduce the risk.\n\nHe\u2019s held one job during the year. Employment history usually indicates stability and can contribute to reducing future criminal tendencies.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years but specifically mentioned some use during the last month when he felt particularly low. Substance use is a known risk factor, especially if it's recent or severe. This could be a significant indicator pointing towards high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Co-residing with a parent and living in an urban setting generally isn't a strong risk factor unless there are other issues like abuse or neglect noted elsewhere.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which might influence self help mechanisms and relationships, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors here are the recent drug use (which is concerning) and the lack of a strong religious belief which can provide support. While he has some mitigating factors like education and being employed, the recent substance use and his personal beliefs could point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
