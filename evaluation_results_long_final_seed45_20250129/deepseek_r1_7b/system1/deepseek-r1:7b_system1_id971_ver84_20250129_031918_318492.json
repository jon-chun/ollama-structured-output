    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from White background. Age is typically a low or moderate risk factor unless it's very young or old. Being White doesn't directly relate to crime rates in this context; it's more about socioeconomic factors which aren't provided here.\n\nHe has one arrest and a prior conviction. That indicates he's had legal issues before, which can be concerning but isn't always high risk without other factors.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight alone doesn't indicate much unless combined with other metrics like BMI or activity level, which aren't provided here.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly correlate with risk; it could be a protective factor for some issues but not necessarily related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can sometimes deter recidivism if properly utilized, but again, without knowing how he's doing academically or if he's involved in school, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Employment often correlates with lower risk because having a stable income can reduce stress and substance abuse triggers.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before but not recently, which is positive since past use might correlate with higher current use or criminal behavior. However, he also felt down in the past month, which could indicate other stressors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 3 in an urban area suggests he was raised by relatives, possibly due to a broken home. Urban environments can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates but may also offer more opportunities or resources depending on the area.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate existential crisis or lack of spirituality, which might correlate with substance abuse or other behavioral issues.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young with one prior arrest. His living situation and lack of religion don't directly point to high risk but also don't guarantee safety. Without more factors like substance use history, recidivism rate, etc., I can't be certain if he's a high risk. However, considering his past arrest and the potential for increased stress from living with relatives and personal beliefs affecting him, there's some basis for moderate concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
