    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's a strong indicator.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a primary factor here unless there are systemic issues in the area, which isn't specified. He's 5'7\" and 140 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise concerns about weight-related crimes or health issues.\n\nHe's never married and living alone\u2014maybe he's focused on his studies or career, but living alone can sometimes lead to isolation. Not sure if that's a high risk factor yet.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level might correlate with better job opportunities, which could reduce recidivism risk, so maybe not as high of a risk here.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014so he has some work experience, but only one job suggests potential for future career instability or job loss if the job changes or he loses it.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase risky behaviors, so that's a significant risk factor.\n\nHe feels disconnected from God\u2014this could indicate poor spiritual support or lack of faith-based coping mechanisms, which might be linked to other forms of stress or mental health issues affecting his behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's a family environment that might have provided emotional support but could also indicate living conditions that are not ideal for development if there were neglect issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior conviction, drug use, isolation, lack of marriage, and personal beliefs\u2014these seem to stack up towards indicating high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
