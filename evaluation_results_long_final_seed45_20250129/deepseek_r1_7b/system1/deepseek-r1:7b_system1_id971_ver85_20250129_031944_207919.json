    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on the provided criteria. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. His race might be less of an indicator in some contexts, but it's not directly relevant here unless there are stereotypes involved, which I don't see immediately.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which could indicate past behavior that might lead to more issues if repeated. Convictions are a clear risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. This doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's something about his weight or stature affecting his ability to commit serious crimes, but nothing stands out here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Being single might suggest he's more focused on himself, which could be a positive, but I'm not sure how it affects risk without more context.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. A GED can sometimes lead to higher educational aspirations or better job opportunities, which might reduce recidivism risk if he's making progress, but it depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability can be a factor; holding only one job might mean he relies on that income source and could struggle when it ends, potentially leading to financial strain or increased criminal activity.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to safercrushes or illegal activities like drug dealing.\n\nIn the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates low mood or depression, which are strong indicators of potential risk behavior. Depression can make individuals more prone to substance abuse, risky decisions, or self-harm.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such circumstances might have emotional or behavioral issues that could contribute to criminal behavior later on.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God and sees no personal involvement from it. This lack of religious support can sometimes be linked to substance abuse, inability to form strong family bonds, or other risky behaviors influenced by his environment.\n\nPutting this all together: one prior arrest (a significant risk), ongoing drug use (high risk), low mood/depression (very high risk). Other factors like living in a household with three people and not believing in God might have some impact but are less directly linked to immediate recidivism compared to the ones listed. His age is 21, which is relatively young, so maybe he's still developing and less likely to commit serious crimes.\n\nHowever, considering his current state of depression and ongoing drug use, even at a young age, these factors strongly suggest high risk. The GED and college enrollment might indicate he has goals but if those aren't met or if support isn't there, it could lead to issues.\n\nThe one prior job held might mean he's somewhat stable but his circumstances (arrest, drugs, low mood) point towards a risk of further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
