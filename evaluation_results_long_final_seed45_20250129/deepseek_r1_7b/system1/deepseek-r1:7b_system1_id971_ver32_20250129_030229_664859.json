    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age might not be directly indicative unless it's an indicator of higher risk for certain conditions, but at this young age, he could still be in active recovery or education.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. A prior conviction can indicate past behavior issues, which is a red flag but may not alone determine high risk without more context.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs\u2014standard for his age, so no immediate health concerns there.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently pose risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or previous instability.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's seeking further education and might be proactive in changing his situation, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nHe has held one job during the year\u2014single employment can indicate stability, but it depends on the nature of the job. It could also mean he's managing without much support, so potential stressors are present.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can have significant implications for recidivism rates and overall well-being. The recent feelings of low mood might indicate deeper issues or substance abuse contributing to his mental health.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such circumstances can lead to attachment issues, which may affect emotional stability and risk behavior later on.\n\nLastly, he believes God has no role in his personal life\u2014this could indicate a lack of religious support system or spirituality, which might be a factor in seeking help or maintaining sobriety.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and ongoing substance use are significant factors. The single living situation without support adds to the risk, but his education and current job suggest proactive steps. The lack of familial support from an early age could contribute to behavioral issues. However, without more severe recent trauma or active substance abuse beyond the GED holder's area, it might not be a high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
