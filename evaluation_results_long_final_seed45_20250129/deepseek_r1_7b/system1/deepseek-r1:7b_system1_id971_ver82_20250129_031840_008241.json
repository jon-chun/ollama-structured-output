    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's a YES towards high risk.\n\nHis race is White, which isn't directly a risk factor but might influence how other factors are interpreted. Maybe it affects how the court or society views his behavior, but not necessarily his personal risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight doesn't typically indicate much unless combined with other metrics like BMI, which he hasn't provided. So I can tentatively say this isn't a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Unmarried status in a single setting might suggest lower family support, but without more info on his circumstances, it's hard to link directly to risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level usually correlates with better job opportunities and stable living situations, which are positive for risk assessment. So this might reduce the risk slightly.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having at least some income can provide financial stability, which could lower recidivism chances compared to someone without income.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned using it sometimes in the past month and feeling down. This could be a warning sign because drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is associated with higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse, which can lead to further issues.\n\nHis feelings of low mood affecting his daily life are concerning. Emotional distress can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of making impulsive decisions that might lead to criminal behavior.\n\nLiving alone at a young age under the biological mother's household suggests he wasn't raised in a stable environment, which is a red flag. Instability early on can contribute to behavioral issues later.\n\nHis lack of belief in God as affecting his personal life could imply higher levels of secularism or spirituality vacuity, which might correlate with emotional or substance-related problems.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. Drug use, especially recent, along with living situation and emotional state, also point towards a high risk. The other factors like education level don't necessarily mitigate this risk enough to consider it low.\n\nSo overall confidence is around 85% that he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
