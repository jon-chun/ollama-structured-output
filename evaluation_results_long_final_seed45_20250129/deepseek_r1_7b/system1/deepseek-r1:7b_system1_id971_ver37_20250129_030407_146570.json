    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on the provided information. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being younger might be associated with lower recidivism rates, but his age is just one data point.\n\nHe has a arrest history: only one time and a conviction. A single prior offense suggests some risk, but it's not life-threatening on its own.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. This doesn't directly relate to risk unless there's an associated issue with weight or health, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence behavior, but without evidence of domestic issues or other stresses, it might not be a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism because educational attainment can provide better opportunities and skills for reintegration into society.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unemployment spells are often associated with higher risk of reoffending, but having at least one job suggests he's stable enough to avoid immediate issues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse can definitely increase recidivism rates because it may lead to unstable behavior or self-harm, which could have contributed to his current feelings of low mood and depression.\n\nHe felt so down in the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates possible clinically significant mental health issues, such as depression. Depression is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can impair judgment, lead to risky behaviors, or increase substance abuse.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area might suggest exposure to certain environments or potential family dynamics that could influence behavior. However, without specific evidence of trauma or neglect, this isn't directly indicative of high risk but could be a contributing factor.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might not turn to religion for support during tough times, which could affect his coping mechanisms and willingness to seek help when needed.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior arrest, GED, college enrollment, single job\u2014these are positive indicators. However, the presence of drug use (marijuana) and feelings of deep depression are concerning. These issues can significantly impact an individual's ability to reintegrate into society without further issues.\n\nThe combination of a recent arrest, ongoing substance use, and persistent low mood points towards a risk assessment that is not negligible but also not high. While he has some mitigating factors like education and employment, the negative aspects are significant enough to warrant closer monitoring and possibly intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
