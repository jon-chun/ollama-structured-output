First, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nHe's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Not sure how that plays into it yet. He has a arrest history with one conviction and used drugs in the past four years. Drug use can be a red flag for recidivism, especially if he admitted to using them recently. His mental health is mentioned\u2014he felt really down recently. That could increase his risk of becoming violent or reoffending.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean less supervision. He has a GED and is in college, so maybe he's seeking better opportunities but that doesn't always translate into not needing help. He's single, no kids, which also means fewer family supports. His background with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014maybe he was neglectful or there were tough times growing up, which can contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nHe says God has nothing to do with his life, so he might be more self-reliant but could lack a support system. His recent feelings of low mood and drug use suggest possible substance abuse problems, which are strong indicators of high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, ongoing substance issues (past four years), recent mental health strain, living alone with no family support, and a lack of religious or familial guidance. These factors point towards a high risk. I'd say yes with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
