    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a past criminal record which could be a red flag.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. I don't know if his weight or height contributes directly to risk, but maybe it relates to other factors like substance use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation issues, which might increase risk of negative behaviors or substance abuse.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having educational attainment could be positive as it might indicate higher goals, but it also depends on how he uses that education. However, not completing high school before could suggest lower stability.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. A steady job can provide some stability, which usually reduces risk, so I should consider this in balance with other negative factors.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt really down recently. Substance use is a strong indicator of potential for higher risk behaviors like overdosing or becoming involved in more risky situations.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This might suggest exposure to family dynamics that could be negative, but I'm not sure how it directly translates to personal risk.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This attitude can sometimes lead to nihilistic views and decreased motivation for positive behaviors or seeking help when needed.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a past conviction, which is a clear risk factor. His recent substance use (marijuana) adds another layer of potential risk. The young age, living with family in an urban area, and lack of religious involvement might contribute to some negative influences but not as directly concerning as the arrest and drug use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I think his overall risk level is moderate but leans towards high because of the arrest and recent drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
