    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their background and circumstances. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. His age is quite young, which might not be directly indicative of high risk unless there are other factors. His criminal history shows only one arrest and one conviction, so that's not a significant issue yet.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. No immediate red flags here; it's just standard information without any obvious association with risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or being a loner, but without other factors, this might not be enough to classify as high risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Completing high school and pursuing higher education usually indicates a desire for better opportunities, which isn't necessarily a risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment shows stability, which is positive for reducing recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned other substances. During the last month, he felt down and couldn't find joy. This could indicate mood swings or perhaps substance use issues that might affect his behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age suggests early exposure to family dynamics. If God isn't considered a factor for him personally, it might imply a lack of religious support or belief, which can influence his coping mechanisms and possibly increase stress levels.\n\nPutting this all together: While there are some concerning aspects like drug use and living conditions, the majority of factors point towards stability and positive influences. The single job, GED, and living away from home with family might suggest he's in a good position to succeed and maintain sobriety. However, the mention of mood swings due to lack of joy could hint at potential emotional challenges that might affect his risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
