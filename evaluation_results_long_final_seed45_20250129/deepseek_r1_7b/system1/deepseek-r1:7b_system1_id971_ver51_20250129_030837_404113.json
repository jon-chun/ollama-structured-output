    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these risk factors for the person described. So, I'm supposed to determine if they indicate a high risk based on these factors.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That might not be directly related unless there's something about race in this context, but since it's a minor detail here, maybe I can ignore it for now or consider it neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Arrests are usually linked to criminal history, which typically indicates some level of risk because they've had past issues with the law. But being convicted is significant; that should be noted as high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, weight 140 lbs \u2013 these don't seem directly related unless there's a concern about his health or something else, but I don't see it here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate risk unless he has issues maintaining that status, but without more info, it might not be significant enough to raise the prediction.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college \u2013 this suggests he's educated, which could be positive or negative depending on other factors. If he's completing his education, maybe he's less likely to commit crimes again, so that might lower risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year \u2013 not much information about issues at work unless he had problems there, but it seems stable since he's only holding one job.\n\nDrug use: He used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to other behaviors or problems. Also, he felt down for some of the past month and couldn't find anything to cheer him up \u2013 that might indicate depression or low motivation, which are red flags.\n\nHe lived at a young age with his biological mother in an urban area where there were three people in the household. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and different social dynamics, but unless he has issues related to that environment, it's hard to say.\n\nFinally, he believes that God doesn't affect his personal life \u2013 which might indicate a lack of religious support or belief, possibly leading to isolation or darker thoughts if he associates with no religion.\n\nPutting this together: He has a criminal history (conviction), substance abuse (marijuana use and feelings of low mood), living in an urban area at a young age, and a lack of religious belief. All these factors point towards high risk because each individual issue could contribute to future issues like further substance abuse, unstable relationships, or criminal behavior.\n\nSo, the confidence level would be high since multiple risk indicators are present. I think 90% is reasonable as it's a strong indication but not absolute certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
