    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determining if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is White, which might be associated with certain stereotypes about behavior or outcomes in risk assessments, but it's important to note that race alone doesn't determine risk without context. He has one arrest and a prior conviction, so that indicates some criminal history, which can be a significant risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; he's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. His living situation is living alone, which might suggest a lower support network, but I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator of high risk without more context like past living arrangements or support.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, so his education level isn't low; he's actively pursuing higher education. That could be seen as positive because educated individuals might make better decisions, but it also depends on other factors like motivation or circumstances.\n\nHe's single, which again doesn't directly indicate risk without more info about his personal circumstances, like financial stability or past relationships.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt quite down recently. This substance use could impact his current behavior and mental health. While marijuana use isn't as severe as other drugs, it might affect his ability to function or make decisions properly.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's not unusual; urban environments can have various social dynamics. However, if there were issues within that household, that could be a red flag, but without specific information about those issues, I might assume it's a typical situation.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events is a strong indicator of lack of religious support or faith in higher power. This might relate to his mental health or life choices. Some people find comfort in their faith for coping mechanisms, so lacking that could lead to emotional instability or substance abuse.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and conviction are concerning but not alone enough. His living situation isn't a red flag without more info. Education-wise, he's doing okay, which is positive. The marijuana use and recent low mood suggest possible underlying issues. The belief in God might indicate a lack of support system affecting his mental health.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because of the arrest history, substance use, and possible mental health implications from his beliefs. However, without more detailed information on each factor, my confidence is moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
