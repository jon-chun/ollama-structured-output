    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let's break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age-wise, being in his late twenties might be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to younger individuals, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which can be significant depending on the type and severity of the crime. Since it's only one arrest and conviction, I'm not sure how severe the previous offense was. But even one conviction can increase risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. This might relate to his lifestyle or behaviors that could be linked to substance abuse, but height doesn't directly indicate risk factors unless combined with other stats like BMI.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone isn't necessarily a bad sign, though it can sometimes be an indicator of instability if there are underlying issues. However, without more context on living situations or personal circumstances, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Educational attainment can correlate with lower recidivism rates because higher education often leads to better job opportunities and support systems. So this might be protective rather than indicating high risk.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment stability is generally associated with reduced risk of reoffending, as having a steady income can provide motivation and reduce stress.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up. This could indicate mild substance use issues or depression, which might be linked to other risk factors like anxiety or depression affecting his decision-making or relationships.\n\nHis recent emotional state is negative; feeling down for much of the past month could suggest ongoing mental health issues that might influence his behavior or willingness to engage in positive activities.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This could imply exposure to family dynamics, possibly including neglect or abuse if God isn't seen as a factor for him. The lack of involvement from a higher power might suggest he doesn't have strong emotional support or guidance, which could be a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and possible drug use are concerning points that increase risk. However, the GED and college enrollment, along with employment, are positive factors that can mitigate risk. The personal circumstances and living situation might suggest underlying issues but without more data, it's hard to quantify their impact.\n\nConsidering everything, I think there's a moderate to low risk indicated by these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\nThis response indicates that while there are some concerning factors like past drug use and living circumstances, the presence of positive factors such as education and employment suggest that this individual is not a high risk. The confidence level reflects an overall moderate assessment based on the given data.\n\nNote: The confidence score here is illustrative and should be replaced with an actual confidence value based on a thorough risk assessment analysis.\n```",
