    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is typically associated with being an adult and having some life experience. Being White doesn't inherently indicate a higher or lower risk without more context.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which could be a red flag but not necessarily high risk on its own.Convictions can influence risk assessments, especially if they're in serious offenses.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, and he weighs 140 lbs. No immediate information here about his weight relative to his height or any health issues that might affect risk behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of being independent but doesn't directly correlate with high risk without knowing more about his personal circumstances or social support.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, which suggests he's pursuing higher education and may be self-motivated. Education usually correlates with lower risk behaviors compared to those without it.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Joblessness can sometimes lead to risky behaviors but having a job might indicate stability.\n\nUsing drugs past four years (marijuana) shows substance use, which can have negative consequences on mental health and relationships. Past month feeling down might indicate low mood or depression, both of which could increase risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to certain environments that might not be conducive for healthy development but doesn't directly indicate high risk without knowing more about the family dynamics.\n\nFinally, he believes God has no role in his personal life, which might influence his outlook on life or relationships but doesn't directly point to high risk behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some negative indicators like prior arrest, substance use, and belief in a lack of divine involvement, the presence of education, living alone (which can be positive), and being 21 years old with presumably some life experience might temper the risk. However, since he has a prior conviction and uses drugs, which are both high-risk factors, I would tentatively say there's a high likelihood this person is at a higher risk despite other mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
