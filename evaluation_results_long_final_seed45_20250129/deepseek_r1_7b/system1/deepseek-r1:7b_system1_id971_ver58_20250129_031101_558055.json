    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White, but race isn't directly related to his risk here unless there are systemic issues, which might be beyond this scope. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's already concerning because prior convictions can significantly impact risk assessment.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight is below average for his height, but without knowing his BMI or body fat percentage, it's hard to assess if that's an issue related to substance use or other health risks.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014 living situations can affect mental health through isolation, which might contribute to feelings of depression. He has a GED and is in college, so he's probably educated but still facing challenges. Being enrolled in college could indicate he's seeking better opportunities, which might reduce risk if he's proactive.\n\nHe's held one job during the year\u2014 having some income can provide stability compared to someone without an income source. But unemployment or underemployment could also be risk factors depending on other factors like support networks.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for part of the month. Drug use, especially substances that lower mood, can lead to depression-like symptoms. This could increase risk if it's ongoing or if he's struggling with substance abuse leading to further issues.\n\nFeeling down a lot lately\u2014 this could be signs of depression or anxiety. Persistent negative emotions without obvious triggers might indicate an underlying mental health issue.\n\nLiving at a young age in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014 early life experiences can influence behavior and mental health. Urban environments sometimes have different stressors compared to rural areas, which could affect his risk level.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with his personal life\u2014 this might indicate a lack of spirituality or faith, which some may associate with resilience against certain stresses but could also be a sign of coping mechanisms when things get tough. It's subjective and might not directly correlate with high risk without more context.\n\nPutting all these together, prior convictions are the most direct indicator of a higher risk since they contribute to criminal history impacting future behavior and stability. The other factors point towards possible mental health issues or substance use complications but aren't as strong indicators unless combined with other indicators like multiple drug use incidents or severe emotional states.\n\nSo, considering his one prior arrest and conviction, along with the signs of depression-like feelings and potential substance use, he's likely to have a high risk. The confidence level is set at 85% because these factors are significant but not exclusively indicative without more data on his current mental health status or other risk factors like multiple drug abuse or severe emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
