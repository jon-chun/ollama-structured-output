    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, race can be a factor in recidivism, but it's not the most significant on its own. He has been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear criminal history which increases risk. \n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight doesn't directly indicate risk without considering other factors like past behavior or health issues.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone is associated with higher risk of substance abuse and isolation, both of which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education, especially GED, is usually linked to lower recidivism rates because it often leads to better job opportunities and skills. However, being in college might also indicate he's trying to improve his situation, so this could be a mixed factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having a job can help with financial stability and reducing stress, but if the job was unstable or he had issues there, it might not be as positive. \n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is legal and less severe than other drugs, but even so, substance abuse is a risk factor.\n\nHe felt down for most of the last month. Emotional distress can lead to substance use and self-harm behaviors, both of which are high-risk indicators.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living with siblings could potentially provide support but living in an urban setting might have different implications regarding family dynamics or social environments.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his life. This lack of religious affiliation can lead to existential questions and may contribute to substance abuse or self-harm, which are high-risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The key risk factors here are the prior arrest (conviction), drug use, emotional distress, and living in an urban environment without strong family support. While he has a GED and is in college, these positive aspects might not outweigh the negatives. The combination of these factors points towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
