    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual described. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That alone doesn't raise immediate red flags, but his age is quite young\u2014just starting to come of age. However, being 21 isn't necessarily a bad sign on its own.\n\nHe has a arrest history of 1 time with a conviction. One offense might not be significant unless it's a serious crime, which I don't have information on here. His education level is a GED and currently enrolled in college, which suggests he's committed to improving himself. Education usually correlates with better job prospects and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs at 5'7\", so his BMI isn't high, but that doesn't directly impact risk assessment unless combined with other factors like weight or health issues.\n\nLiving alone is common among young adults, especially those not in a stable family environment. However, it's also a precautionary measure to avoid liability.\n\nHis past four years include drug use only marijuana, which isn't severe. But using any drugs can have negative consequences on mental health and behavior. The fact that he felt down for much of the month adds another layer\u2014consistent feelings of low mood could be a sign of underlying issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nHe was raised in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area. That's a typical family setup, but if there were neglectful or abusive behaviors during that time, it could have long-term effects. The lack of involvement from God might indicate he doesn't have a strong support system or religious guidance, which can affect mental health and decision-making.\n\nConsidering his current situation\u2014he's in college, stable financially at 21, and has minimal past issues\u2014these factors lean towards lower risk. However, the combination of drug use and mood issues could raise some concerns. He might be susceptible to stressors from work or personal challenges that could escalate into more serious behavior if not addressed.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some minor red flags like drug use and mood issues, he's overall in a good position with positive attributes like education and living independently. His low confidence level might stem from past experiences, but his current proactive steps (like attending college) suggest a commitment to change.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
