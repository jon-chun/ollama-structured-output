    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their background and circumstances. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise concerns about risk but could influence other factors like community perception or social interactions.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, which is significant. Convictions, especially for non-serious offenses, can affect his credibility and willingness to follow laws, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. While this doesn't directly relate to risk factors, it's worth noting if he has a history of being underweight or overweight, which could impact his physical health and behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, or loneliness, especially when combined with other stressors. This might influence his mental health and decision-making abilities.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, indicating some level of education but also showing that he's not currently employed full-time. Maybe this could affect his motivation or willingness to seek help if needed.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having at least some employment shows responsibility and potential for positive interactions with employers and colleagues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is legal but could indicate occasional substance abuse. However, he also felt down in the dumps recently, suggesting possible deeper issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nLiving with his biological mother since a young age in an urban area might have shaped his life experiences. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher stress levels due to crime, poverty, etc., which could affect his risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nLastly, he doesn't see a connection between his personal life and God, which might suggest an atheistic worldview or lack of religious support for coping with challenges. This could be linked to self-reliance but might also indicate coping mechanisms that don't address mental health issues effectively.\n\nPutting this all together: A single prior conviction increases risk. Drug use and recent feelings of low mood could point towards substance abuse or mental health issues, which are significant risks. His isolation from family and living in an urban environment may contribute to stressors that could lead to risky behavior. While he has some positive factors like education and employment, the negative ones seem more impactful.\n\nI think these factors together suggest a high risk, so I'd lean towards \"YES\" with confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
