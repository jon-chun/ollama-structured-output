    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being young might not necessarily be a high risk unless there are other factors. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, which is significant because prior convictions can indicate past behavior issues that may continue.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless they relate to other health conditions or possible abuse indicators, but in this case, it's not specified. Living alone might be an indicator of potential isolation, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's seeking better opportunities and possibly more responsible behavior compared to someone with less education. Being single and living alone doesn't directly point towards high risk unless there are other signs like substance abuse or lack of support.\n\nHis use of marijuana past four years isn't severe enough on its own but combined with the recent feelings of depression could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which can be a risk factor.\n\nThe mention that he felt down for most of the past month raises red flags about mental health. Persistent negative emotions without support might lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe was a minor when he lived with his biological mother in an urban household of three. Exposure at a young age could have long-term effects, possibly leading to behavioral issues or substance abuse as an attempt to cope.\n\nLastly, he denies any religious involvement, which can sometimes be linked to self-destructive behavior if he turns to other outlets for stress relief.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, potential mental health issues, and family background\u2014it's likely that this individual poses a high risk. The combination of past convictions, recent feelings of depression, substance use, and negative family experiences points towards a significant need for further assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
