    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being a minority might correlate with higher recidivism rates, but it's not always the case and depends on other factors. So that's something to note.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is already a red flag because it indicates he's had trouble complying with legal obligations before, which could affect his ability to reintegrate successfully.\n\nHis physical description: 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. Not sure if that matters much here unless there's an issue related to weight or access to resources based on size. Doesn't seem directly relevant but maybe indirectly through other factors like substance use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone is a bit concerning because it might affect his social support network, which can influence both positive and negative behaviors. However, not being married doesn't inherently make someone a risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having a GED usually indicates some level of education, which can sometimes be protective against further criminal behavior if properly utilized. However, he's also pursuing higher education, so that might help him reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Only one job suggests limited economic independence or alternative income sources. Maybe that could increase stress or dependency on a single source, which is a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use, especially if it's ongoing or recent, can significantly impact an individual's behavior and ability to form stable relationships. It's a strong indicator of potential high risk.\n\nHe felt so down that nothing could cheer him up, which points towards depression or a low mood, which are associated with higher risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Small households can sometimes lead to more stress or neglect if not properly addressed, but without more context, it's hard to assess the impact here.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might have a lack of spiritual support, which could contribute to emotional instability and substance use issues, both of which are risk factors.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest, drug use, living alone, potential mental health issues (depression), and a lack of strong social support. These factors collectively point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
