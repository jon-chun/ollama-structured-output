    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White, arrested once and convicted. His height and weight are noted but don't seem directly relevant here. He's single, living alone, has a GED, and is in college. He's only worked one job recently.\n\nHe uses marijuana and sometimes feels really down in the past four years. At 18, he lived with his mom in a household of three in an urban area. He doesn't believe in God for personal matters. \n\nLooking at these factors, I should consider recidivism indicators like previous convictions, substance use (marijuana), emotional distress, living situation, and lack of religious belief.\n\nPrevious arrest is a risk factor. He's 21, so not too old but also young enough to have had experiences that might impact his behavior. Substance use can contribute to unstable mood or decision-making.\n\nLiving with his mom in a household could be stressful; maybe he's been exposed to family issues or neglect if it was mentioned elsewhere (though not here). Not believing in God might affect his motivation towards good behavior, possibly leading to more negative or self-destructive actions.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which are positive steps. College attendance can sometimes indicate better opportunities but may also suggest he hasn't found direction yet. Employing only one job could mean he's not fully engaged with gainful employment, leaving room for dependency or further issues.\n\nHis emotional distress (feeling down) might lead to substance use as a coping mechanism, which is a risk factor. \n\nPutting it all together: He has prior arrest, substance use, possible family stress from living with mom, emotional issues, and lack of religious belief. These factors can increase the likelihood of reoffending. While he's in college and has a GED, these are some achievement indicators but may not directly mitigate against risk if he lacks support or motivation.\n\nSo I'd rate this as high risk with maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
