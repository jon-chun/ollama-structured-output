    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their chance of reoffending or similar outcomes. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might not be a strong indicator on its own, but being younger could mean more potential life experiences that might lead to different behaviors. Being White doesn't immediately strike me as a risk factor unless there's some systemic bias, which I don't have information on here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Conviction history is significant because prior offenses can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to possible underlying issues or increased responsibility towards the system. So this is a positive sign for high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, weight 140 lbs \u2013 not sure how relevant that is unless there's an association with substance abuse or health issues, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be isolating, but I don't know if that directly correlates with higher risk unless combined with other factors like drug use or previous instability.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in a 4-year college \u2013 getting education might indicate better opportunities or less likelihood of engaging in risky activities, so this might lower the risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having limited work experience could mean he's not gaining valuable life skills or facing professional challenges that might contribute to delinquency if not addressed.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some time recently. Drug abuse can significantly increase the risk of reoffending, especially when combined with other problematic behaviors like feeling low or disconnected.\n\nHe felt so down in the dumps during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. Emotional distress might be a sign of deeper issues, possibly related to substance use or neglect. This could point towards higher risk if not addressed by appropriate support systems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living with multiple people could lead to emotional neglect or strained relationships, which might contribute to behavioral issues as he grows older.\n\nFinally, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal circumstances. This attitude can sometimes correlate with higher levels of immaturity or lack of religious guidance, potentially leading to riskier behaviors if not addressed by supportive environments.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: a prior conviction, drug use, emotional distress, living in an environment without strong family support, and his belief system that doesn't provide spiritual guidance. These seem to point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
