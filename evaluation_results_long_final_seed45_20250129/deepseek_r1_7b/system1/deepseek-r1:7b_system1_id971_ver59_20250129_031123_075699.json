    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk and respond with a JSON object containing \"prediction\" as \"YES\" or \"NO\", along with a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, let's go through each risk factor one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: 21 years old. Generally, younger individuals might be at lower risk for recidivism compared to older adults, but age alone isn't a strong indicator without other factors.\n   \n2. **Race**: White. The dataset doesn't indicate any racial disparities in the US regarding criminal justice, so this factor is neutral.\n\n3. **Number of Arrests and Convictions**: 1 arrest and 1 conviction. A single conviction can increase risk as it's a past negative behavior leading to legal issues.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes**: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. These are standard for a 21-year-old male, so no immediate red flags here.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Currently living alone and never married. Living arrangements can be a risk factor if there's instability or lack of support, but it depends on other factors like economic status.\n   \n6. **Education Level**: Has a GED and is in college. Education, especially higher education, is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n7. **Employment**: Holds 1 job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism as having a stable income source might prevent future dependency on substance abuse or illegal activities.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some of the past month. Substance use, especially recent or frequent use, is a significant risk factor linked to various criminal behaviors and higher chances of reoffending.\n\n9. **Living Situation at Young Age**: Lived with biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Early-life stress from living arrangements can affect mental health, which might influence substance abuse or other risky behaviors later on.\n\n10. **Beliefs**: Doesn't consider God as affecting his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which might be a contributing factor to substance abuse and instability.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of drug use (a strong indicator) along with past convictions and limited support from family (even though it's at a young age) suggests moderate risk. However, the individual is relatively young and has positive factors like education and employment which might temper the risk. On balance, while there are concerning signs, they don't entirely outweigh the mitigating factors.\n\nTherefore, I would predict \"YES\" with high confidence but not certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
