    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might not be directly predictive unless there are age-specific risk indicators, but he's quite young. Being White isn't inherently a risk factor; it could just be an identifier.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense. Convictions are generally associated with higher recidivism rates, so that's something to note.\n\nHe is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. No information on BMI or weight category provided, but the numbers don't immediately indicate obesity unless he has a body fat percentage that's considered high, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to mental health issues, as noted in the report.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education level is usually protective against recidivism if it's ongoing, but having a GED could also mean he's seeking further education, so maybe not as strong an indicator here.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment status can affect mental health because income might provide more stability or access to resources like food and shelter.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a significant risk factor for various issues, including mental health problems and substance abuse which can lead to further criminal behavior.\n\nIn the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates persistent low mood, which is a sign of depression or a mood disorder. Both are strong indicators of high risk as they can impair judgment, increase impulsive behaviors, and make reentry into society challenging.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Family environment can influence behavior; living in an urban setting might have different stressors compared to rural areas. However, the size of the household could mean more support or less stability depending on other factors not provided here.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or belief, which can affect coping mechanisms and mental health positively or negatively, but without more context, it's hard to assess how this impacts risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (1), drug use (marijuana in past 4 years), persistent low mood, living with biological mother in a household of 3 urban area. While his GED and college enrollment are present, along with employment, they might mitigate some risks but don't directly address the negative factors.\n\nThe presence of multiple risk indicators like substance abuse, low mood, prior conviction, and family background suggests that he is at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
