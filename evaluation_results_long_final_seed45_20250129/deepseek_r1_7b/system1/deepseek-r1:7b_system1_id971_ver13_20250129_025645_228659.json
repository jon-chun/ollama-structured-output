    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not directly indicate high risk but could be a consideration in terms of support systems or community ties.\n\nHe has a arrest history with one conviction. While having a criminal record can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to prior unstable living situations or substance use, it's important to look at other factors too.\n\nHis physical attributes are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. No direct link here unless there's an assumption about body type linked to behavior, but I don't think that's relevant.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation issues, which might contribute to mental health issues he's showing.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which are positive factors as they suggest some level of education and pursuit of future goals. This could indicate better coping mechanisms and less likely to engage in risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances or social isolation, both of which might contribute to his current issues.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some time in the last month feeling down and not able to cope. This could indicate ongoing substance abuse problems, which are typically high risk factors because they can lead to further instability and crimes.\n\nHis past living situation was with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That might suggest exposure to family dynamics or environment that could influence his behavior and mental health.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which could contribute to feelings of alienation or lack of direction, potentially leading to risky behaviors like drug use or seeking help.\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially the drug use history and living situation, it seems there are clear indicators pointing towards a high risk. The confidence level is quite high because the factors strongly suggest substance abuse issues, which are typically associated with higher risk in recidivism.\n</think>\n\nThe individual shows several signs of potential high risk due to his past substance use (especially marijuana) and other behavioral factors that could contribute to instability or further criminal activity. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
