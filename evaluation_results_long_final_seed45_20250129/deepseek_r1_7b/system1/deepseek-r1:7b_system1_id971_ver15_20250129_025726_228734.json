    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. Ethnicity alone doesn't usually have a strong association with recidivism, but it's worth noting.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can be a significant risk factor because it shows criminal history which often correlates with future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, but combined with other factors like BMI or previous substance use, it might matter, though I don't see BMI here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems; however, being single doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there are issues with support networks.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having educational credentials is usually protective against reoffending because it provides opportunities and upward mobility. But if he's already in college, maybe he's motivated to change his trajectory.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment history can be positive as having stable income reduces stress and financial strain, which are common contributors to recidivism. One job isn't a strong indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the past month he felt very down and couldn't cheer himself up. This indicates potential substance abuse issues, especially if it's recent or severe. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for reoffending because using drugs can lead to self-abuse, which might drive further criminal behavior.\n\nHe felt so down recently that nothing could cheer him up. Persistent low mood and lack of motivation are signs of possible depression or substance use disorder, both of which can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting might have had negative influences like limited parental supervision or neglect, which can contribute to higher risk if these conditions are not addressed as he ages.\n\nFinally, he believes that God has no role in his personal life. This lack of religious involvement could be associated with poorer self-esteem or spirituality, which some studies suggest may correlate with higher recidivism rates, though this isn't always consistent and depends on other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and conviction are significant red flags. While he has a GED and is in college, which are protective, the presence of drug use (marijuana) and recent low mood suggest possible substance abuse issues or mental health problems that could increase risk. His living situation with his mother might not be ideal but isn't inherently a strong risk factor without more context on the environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would lean towards high risk because of the arrest history, potential substance use, and possibly related mental health issues. The presence of a GED and college enrollment mitigates some risk, but other factors are more influential here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
