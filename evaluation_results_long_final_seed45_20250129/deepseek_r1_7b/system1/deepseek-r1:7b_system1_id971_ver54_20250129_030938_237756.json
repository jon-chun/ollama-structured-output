    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factor profile for a 21-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's young at 21 years old. Young adults are generally considered lower risk because they're still developing socially and emotionally. But age alone doesn't make someone high risk; other factors matter too.\n\nHe identifies as White, which might influence his risk perception based on societal stereotypes, but without more context, I shouldn't assume that's a strong indicator here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and is convicted. A single prior conviction can be significant because it shows some level of legal trouble, but one isn't usually enough to classify someone as high risk unless there are other factors like substance abuse or unstable family environment.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 140 lbs. No immediate red flags here; this doesn't directly relate to risk unless combined with other metrics.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone, which can be a sign of possible social isolation. Living alone can lead to loneliness and stress, but again, without more info on his environment or support systems, it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having educational credentials can sometimes indicate responsible behavior, but it's not a guarantee. People with higher education might be more likely to seek help if they're struggling.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long could suggest instability, but having a job shows he's employed somewhere. It depends on whether that job was stable or fulfilling.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse can significantly increase risk as it affects mental health and ability to function. Even if he's not currently using, recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues.\n\nFeeling \"down\" for some time suggests possible depression or anxiety, which are serious mental health issues that raise risk factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area might indicate family environment concerns. Being in a larger household doesn't necessarily mean it's unstable, but living away from the biological parent could lead to emotional issues if there's no close support.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he may be experiencing spirituality or religious distress, which can affect mental health and self-perception.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest and conviction are a point in favor of caution. However, the factors like substance abuse (marijuana use), recent feelings of low mood, and living alone could significantly increase risk. The presence of a GED and college enrollment also might indicate he's trying to improve but isn't necessarily doing so successfully.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are mitigating factors, several risk indicators suggest that this individual is at a higher risk than average for certain negative outcomes related to mental health or substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
