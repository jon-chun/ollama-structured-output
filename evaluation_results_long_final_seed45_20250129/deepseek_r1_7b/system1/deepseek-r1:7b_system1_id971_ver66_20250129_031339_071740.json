    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once and convicted. That one prior conviction could be significant because it shows he has already faced legal consequences, which might indicate past behavior issues or previous mistakes.\n\nHe stands at 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. No information on how his weight relates to risk here. His marital status is single and he's living alone, which doesn't immediately raise red flags but could be a factor in support system strength.\n\nHe has a GED and is attending college, which suggests some level of education and commitment to personal development. That might indicate he's motivated to change his situation rather than being a long-term risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Single employment can contribute to stability but also depends on whether it was stable or fulfilling enough.\n\nDrug use history: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt very down in the past month. Substance abuse, especially if recent, could be a high-risk factor as it often correlates with unstable mental health and self-control issues.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal life might point towards a lack of religious support or guidance, which could affect his decision-making or relationships. However, it's not a direct risk indicator but something to consider alongside other factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Family environment can influence behavior and mental health; living with an extended family might offer support but the size could also mean lack of individual attention if not properly managed.\n\nHis lack of belief in God could be seen as a sign of secularism or spirituality, which some may find lacking in areas where religious guidance provides emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together: A prior conviction does indicate past legal issues. Drug use, especially recent, and living with an extended family might suggest potential vulnerabilities. His single status and living alone without significant support could be a risk factor as well. The lack of belief in God might not directly contribute to risk but is worth noting.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are some concerning factors like past convictions and drug use, the individual doesn't present an extremely high-risk profile. However, the presence of a prior conviction does increase the risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
