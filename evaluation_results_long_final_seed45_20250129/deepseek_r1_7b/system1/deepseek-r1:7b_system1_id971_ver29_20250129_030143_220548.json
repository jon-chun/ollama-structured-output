    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk factor indicates high risk based on the given information. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White descent. Age might not be a huge indicator here unless there's something specific about being so young, but it doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's just one offense; while that could raise some concerns, it alone isn't usually considered high risk unless it's a violent crime or something severe. So maybe 30% confidence on that point.\n\nHe is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. That seems within normal range for his age, so no immediate issues there.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be a sign of possible social isolation or loneliness, which might affect mental health indirectly but doesn't necessarily make him a high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having educational resources could potentially help him get better job opportunities or support, reducing future issues. So that's a positive point, maybe 20% against high risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, which suggests he might have some work experience but it also means he hasn't been employed for a long time. Unemployment can lead to dependency and potential issues with substance use or mental health if not addressed.\n\nIn the past four years, he used drugs (marijuana) and felt really down in the dumps once, saying nothing could cheer him up. Drug use is concerning because it can lead to various problems like addiction, which might affect his ability to function or commit further crimes. The mood state indicates possible depression or other mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living in a multi-person home could mean exposure to stressors, maybe neglect or abuse if there were issues. Urban environments can have different dynamics that might contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life. This could be linked to fundamentalist beliefs which are sometimes associated with criminal behavior, but it's not a direct indicator without more context about how this affects him.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest (moderate), drug use (high concern), possible isolation or mental health issues, living situation in an urban area, and beliefs that don't align with societal norms. The drug use seems like the most significant risk factor here, along with the potential mental health impact from his mood state.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I think there's a moderate to high risk here. Maybe around 65% confidence since while there are mitigating factors like GED and college enrollment, the positives about living situation and job history don't outweigh the negatives related to substance use and possible mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the significant risk factors such as prior arrest, drug use, and potential mental health concerns, which together indicate a moderate to high risk level.",
