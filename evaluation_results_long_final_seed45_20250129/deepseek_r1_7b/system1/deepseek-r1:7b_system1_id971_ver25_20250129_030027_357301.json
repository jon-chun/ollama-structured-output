    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to analyze this risk factor step by step. First, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once and convicted, which already raises some concerns. Age being 21 might indicate he's still in his prime years, but considering he has a criminal history, that could be a red flag.\n\nHe's described as having a GED and attending college, which suggests he's committed to furthering his education, possibly indicating responsibility or maybe not taking full advantage of opportunities. However, it's important to note how his education is impacting his current behavior rather than just his status.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk factors unless there's a health concern implied by the numbers. Living alone could have its own set of issues, like isolation or lack of support system, but without more context on any other issues, it's hard to say how significant this is in terms of risk.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone; again, these factors can be part of a larger picture without specific evidence pointing towards a problem. His use of marijuana over the past four years isn't a major red flag unless there are more severe drug or alcohol issues.\n\nThe sentiment that he feels down and couldn't find comfort during the past month is concerning. It might indicate underlying mental health issues, which can significantly influence behavior and risk level. However, without a professional opinion confirming this, it's speculative.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. This could have shaped his personality or circumstances but doesn't directly point to criminal tendencies unless there are additional family issues not mentioned here.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might suggest a lack of religious support, which can sometimes influence behavior and decision-making. It's possible he turns to other sources for comfort or guidance, which could affect risk assessments if those sources aren't reliable.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there are some concerning elements like the criminal history, potential mental health issues, and family background. However, without more detailed information on each of these areas, it's challenging to assign a definitive high risk level. The presence of a GED and college enrollment might counterbalance some of the negative traits if he's actively working on improving.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are factors that could increase risk, the overall profile isn't overwhelmingly bad without more specific data pointing towards each concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
