    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White and hasn't specified any other risk indicators yet. Age being 21 is actually quite young, which might suggest he's still developing his skills or behaviors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior criminal history can indicate unstable behavior or trust issues with law enforcement.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately strike me as concerning unless there's an issue with body image, but since it's 5'7\" and 140 lbs, which is actually on the lower side for his height. Maybe he has some health concerns that could affect risk assessment, but no direct info here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with substance abuse issues or isolation leading to self-harm behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which shows he's motivated to improve education and may be less likely to engage in risky behavior compared to those without such support.\n\nHeld one job during the year, so maybe stable income but could also indicate busier lifestyle with less time for personal issues.\n\nUsed drugs within the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can have various effects; some might lead to more impulsive behaviors or mental health issues if not properly managed.\n\nIn the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This could be a sign of depression or a low mood affecting his behavior and relationships.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area.Younger age might suggest less life experience, but living with an extended family can sometimes lead to different dynamics.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which could indicate religious disaffection or spirituality issues, potentially affecting mental health and behavior patterns.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and conviction are concerning. Drug use, especially recent marijuana use, along with feelings of low mood and depression, suggest possible substance abuse issues. Living in a household with an extended family at a young age might have different implications but without more info on the environment's impact. His self-identified lack of religious affiliation could be linked to mental health challenges.\n\nConsidering all factors, there are clear red flags indicating potential high risk behaviors or needs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
