    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She's Black, hasn't been convicted yet but has one arrest. Her factors include living alone at home, not using drugs, no depression in the past month, and some other specifics.\n\nFirst, her race is a factor because there are systemic issues that might affect her access to resources or support systems. That's high risk.\n\nShe was arrested once; that's medium risk since it shows she has been involved with the system but hasn't faced consequences yet.\n\nLiving alone in a household of five could mean less supervision and stability, which is also high risk.\n\nHer education is a high school diploma plus college, which is positive as higher education usually leads to better job opportunities. But since she's only enrolled, maybe low impact.\n\nEmployment: one job during the year might be enough for support but isn't a strong indicator of stability over three years\u2014so medium.\n\nNo drug use and no depression are positive factors indicating good mental health and substance abuse prevention, which is low risk.\n\nHer early life in a big household in an urban area could have had challenges that affect her now\u2014but since she's doing well mentally and education-wise, maybe mitigates some of the high risk from living with five people. So perhaps medium.\n\nOverall, considering all these factors, I think there's a moderate to low risk but not negligible. Maybe around 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"The individual is Black, which is associated with systemic barriers that can influence access to support and resources, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest but not being convicted suggests potential substance abuse or other issues that may affect future stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone in a household of five could indicate limited supervision and social support, which are risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"While she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, this does not guarantee stable employment or independence, which can influence recidivism rates over three years.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Employing one job during the past year may provide some stability but does not ensure consistent income or support systems that could prevent future issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs in the past four years indicates a clean record, which is protective of reoffending and suggests adherence to sobriety efforts.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month highlights good mental health, which supports overall well-being and reduces the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Experience\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could have had challenges that might affect her current behavior or decision-making, but she has done well mentally and education-wise recently.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
