    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's got a history of being arrested once and convicted. That's a solid red flag because prior convictions are strongly correlated with future criminal behavior. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHis age is 21, which might seem young, but if he's already been through arrest and conviction, the longer it takes for him to get out of trouble, the higher the chance he'll come back. That makes me lean towards a medium-high risk factor here.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't see any systemic issues with race here since there are no specific factors related to race mentioned. So maybe this doesn't add much weight either way.\n\nHis height and weight aren't particularly relevant unless they're indicators of health or something else, but since he's healthy enough (140 lbs at 5'7\"), I'll just note that as low risk for now.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase stress and substance use, both of which are bad signs. That seems medium-high.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. While having a GED doesn't immediately point towards criminal behavior, being enrolled in college shows he's striving for something positive. This could mitigate some risk but not enough to lower it completely.\n\nHe held only one job last year. Job loss can lead to financial strain and potentially substance abuse as a coping mechanism. So that might be medium-high risk because of possible stress or substance use.\n\nDrug use history is a major red flag, especially since he used marijuana before and felt down recently. Drug use is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. This should definitely be high risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Being raised by family might provide stability, but the fact that it was done at such a young age could indicate early exposure to certain influences or environments that might have negative effects on him later on.\n\nHis lack of belief in God is interesting but doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless he's more likely to engage in risky behaviors out of fear of divine punishment, which isn't common. So maybe this factor is low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest and conviction (high), young age (medium-high), living alone (medium-high), drug use (high), job issues (medium-high). The lack of religious belief might be a slight positive but not enough to offset the negatives.\n\nSo overall, considering each factor's weight, I'd lean towards high risk. High confidence because most factors point towards higher likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior, indicating a high risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Young Age at Incarceration\", \"medium-high\", \"Exposure to criminal justice at an early age can lead to ongoing problematic behaviors, contributing to medium-high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone may result in isolation and increased stress, potentially leading to substance use or other negative behaviors, contributing to medium-high risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, especially marijuana, and recent feelings of low mood, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates, indicating high risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Issues\", \"medium-high\", \"Only holding one job for a year may lead to financial stress or substance use as a coping mechanism, contributing to medium-high risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
