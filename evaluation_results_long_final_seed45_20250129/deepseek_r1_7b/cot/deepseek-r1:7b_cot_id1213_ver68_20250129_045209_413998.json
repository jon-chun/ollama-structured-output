    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 19-year-old female. She has some factors to consider here.\n\nFirst, her age is pretty young at 19. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and behaviors. So that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but it's not always the case. It depends on other factors too. Since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe this factor isn't as impactful here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to her risk unless there's a health issue implied by her weight, which I don't see evidence of here.\n\nLiving alone is interesting. Being in a single setting might make her more vulnerable since she doesn't have support from others during stressful times. That could be a medium or high risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college, which are positive indicators as education can lead to better job opportunities and lower chances of engaging in risky behavior. Her job experience is only one during the year; not much work history, but maybe she's still figuring things out.\n\nNo recent drug use or depression symptoms over the past month suggest she's stable mentally and substance-wise. That\u2019s a good sign, so low risk there.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in such a large household might have its challenges but doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there were family issues or neglect, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHer religious affiliation is positive; spirituality can provide guidance and reduce self-harm or destructive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young, has good education, stable living situation, no recent adverse factors. Her living with her mother might have some stressors, but without more info on family issues, it doesn't tip the scale to high risk. Considering everything, I'd lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults typically have lower recidivism rates due to their developmental stage and increased focus on education and personal growth.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a factor, this individual has no evidence of criminal history or significant family issues that would directly correlate with higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to stressors and potential risks without support network.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college is associated with better job prospects and lower risk of engaging in risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate minimal exposure to criminal activities or unstable environments.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No use of drugs in the past four years suggests a stable environment free from drug-related issues which can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No symptoms of depression over the past month suggest a mentally stable individual, reducing the risk of self-harm or destructive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five could indicate potential family dynamics that might be stressors but not directly linked to higher recidivism without further evidence of neglect or abuse.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Spending time with God may provide guidance and reduce self-harm or destructive behavior, contributing to lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
