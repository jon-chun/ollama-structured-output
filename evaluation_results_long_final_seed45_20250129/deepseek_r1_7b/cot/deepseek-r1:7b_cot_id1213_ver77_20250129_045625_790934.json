She's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense. Her age means she's still developing skills, so maybe that's a positive factor.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs and is 5'6\". Maybe her weight isn't directly related to recidivism, but it's just background info. She's living alone, so no support system which could be a risk factor or protective depending on the situation.\n\nNo drugs in the past four years\u2014good sign for substance use as a risk factor. She hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe she has good mental health. That might actually lower her risk since depression can sometimes lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is college-bound, which usually means she's making positive choices. Only one job in the past year\u2014maybe not enough experience or training for serious crimes.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could have both pros and cons. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but also potentially exposure to crime or unstable situations. Being raised by her mother might provide some stability, which is protective.\n\nHer religious beliefs about God influencing her life\u2014religion often provides moral guidance, so that's probably a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She has positive factors like education, stable religion, and no drug use. But the minor arrest could be a risk. However, since she's not convicted yet and is quite young, maybe her overall risk is low to medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, which might indicate prior issues that could affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 19 years old, she is still in her prime years and may be focused on positive life choices.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests a clean slate and lower risk of substance-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed recently could indicate better mental health, which might offset some risk factors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest a desire for further education and positive life choices.\"),\n    (\"job experience\", \"low\", \"Only one job in the past year indicates limited exposure to criminal opportunities or experience.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five could provide some stability but might also indicate past family issues that could impact current behavior.\"),\n    (\"religion influence\", \"high\", \"Considering God has something to do with her life suggests strong moral guidance, which is protective against criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
