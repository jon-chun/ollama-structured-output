    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young, but he has a history of being arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race plays a role here beyond any systemic issues, but since it's noted, I should consider it slightly in the context of potential biased factors, though in this case, he's already been convicted once, so maybe that's a medium factor.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. That doesn't directly relate to recidivism risk, so probably no impact here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can sometimes be linked to higher risk due to potential isolation or lack of support network, but it might not be as significant without more context on his current situation.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can correlate with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so this would be a low factor.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unstable employment history could increase risk because losing jobs often leads to financial stress or substance use issues, which are already present.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk, so this should be high.\n\nYoung age at first arrest (let's say he was 16), living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban environments can have harsher penalties and higher arrest rates, which might contribute to higher risk factors like substance use and prior convictions.\n\nHe believes God has no impact on his life, so he might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors without religious guidance, adding another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (medium), drug use (high), lack of stable employment (low), young age (moderate high?), urban living (high via harsher environment and possible stress), and his belief system (high). \n\nSo the factors are mostly medium to high. I'd predict a high risk but with lower confidence since some factors like education and job status are mitigating.\n</think>\n\nThe risk assessment for this individual involves evaluating several factors that contribute to rearrest recidivism. Key factors include prior criminal history, substance use, lack of stable employment, living circumstances, and personal beliefs.\n\n1. **Prior Criminal History**: Medium - A single prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending but is mitigated by current positive steps like GED and college enrollment.\n2. **Substance Use (Marijuana)**: High - Recent drug use and feelings of low mood are strong indicators of potential relapse.\n3. **Employment Stability**: Low - Holding only one job may lead to financial instability or stress contributing to substance use.\n4. **Living Situation**: Medium-High - Urban environment and living alone, combined with a young age at first arrest, suggest possible isolation and higher risk factors.\n\nConsidering these, the prediction leans towards high risk but acknowledges mitigating factors like education and employment status.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"A single prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending but is mitigated by current positive steps like GED and college enrollment.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and feelings of low mood are strong indicators of potential relapse.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job may lead to financial instability or stress contributing to substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium-high\", \"Urban environment and living alone, combined with a young age at first arrest, suggest possible isolation and higher risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
