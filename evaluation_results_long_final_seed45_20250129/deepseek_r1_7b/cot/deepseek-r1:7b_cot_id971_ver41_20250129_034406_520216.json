    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag because past convictions can indicate higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless it's severely underweight or overweight, which isn't the case here. So I'd rate this as low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. While living arrangements can affect support systems, there's no immediate sign of instability from this factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually helps with getting better jobs, so this should be low risk.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Single job experience isn't bad, but not having stable employment history might contribute to high risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and sometimes recently. Drug use can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, which are bad signs for recidivism.\n\nHis mental health situation is poor\u2014he feels down and can't find joy in things. This could mean he's struggling mentally, which would make him a high risk.\n\nHe was living with his mother at age 15 in an urban area. Early neglect or abuse from parents can have long-term effects on behavior and recidivism.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his life adds to the mental health aspect, suggesting he might be dealing with personal issues which could lead to more substance use and unstable situations.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history is high, drug use and mental health are medium-high, living situation is low. The job experience and education are good. So overall, I think there's a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has one arrest and a conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and lacking joy in life suggests poor mental health, which is a strong indicator of potential for substance abuse and unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no prior marriage does not indicate instability but lacks the support that could potentially reduce risk factors.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college, as well as working one job, suggests stable educational background and some employment history which can contribute to lower risk if consistent.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
