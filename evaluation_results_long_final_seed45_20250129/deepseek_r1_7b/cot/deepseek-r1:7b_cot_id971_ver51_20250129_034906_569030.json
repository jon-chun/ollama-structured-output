    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I know that being White can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates in some studies, but it's also a sensitive issue because of potential biases and systemic factors. So while there might be a slight protective effect here, other factors could negate that.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That's not a lot, so maybe the risk isn't too high from that alone. But I should consider whether this is his only offense or if it's severe. Since it's just an arrest and a conviction, probably low to medium weight here.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. Weight categories can vary, but being underweight sometimes correlates with higher risk in some studies because of lower muscle mass affecting recidivism. But without more info on his body fat or overall health, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being single might increase stress levels which could contribute to substance use or other issues leading to recidivism. So maybe that's a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can lower recidivism, so this should be a protective factor. High weight here.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Job stability usually reduces risk because having income can provide a sense of purpose and reduce stress. So high again.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana past four years, which is a non-serious offense compared to drug abuse. But in the last month, he felt really down and couldn't cheer himself up, which might indicate some underlying issues or stress. That's concerning but maybe not as severe yet. Medium weight because it's recent behavior but not a major issue.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher stressors, poverty, etc., which could increase risk factors like substance use or antisocial behavior. So medium to high here.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might lead him towards self-actualization or rebellion, potentially increasing risk of misconduct or substance abuse in the future. High weight because it's a significant factor related to personal motivation and lack of religious support for dealing with problems.\n\nPutting this all together: Medium factors include living alone and recent drug use. High factors like religion's absence and urban environment could pull him towards high overall risk, but his education and stable job are strong protective measures. So the prediction might lean towards YES with 65% confidence because while he has some mitigating factors, several others push him into a medium to high risk zone.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"medium\", \"While being White may correlate with slightly lower recidivism rates due to potential biases in systemic factors, other aspects such as living situation and substance use can negate this effect.\"),\n    (\"One Arrest and Conviction\", \"low\", \"A single non-severe offense generally has a lower risk compared to more serious offenses.
