    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who wants a risk assessment for a 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is quite young at 21, so maybe that's a low risk since he's still developing. He has a White identifier, but race doesn't usually directly affect recidivism unless there are systemic issues, which I'll note as medium.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction, which might indicate past behavior problems, so medium risk. His height and weight don't seem relevant here.\n\n living alone is a bit concerning, maybe low to medium depending on other factors. No marriage and living alone could be red flags for dependency issues or isolation leading to higher recidivism.\n\nGED and college enrollment are positive signs as they might indicate better educational opportunities, so low risk.\n\nOnly one job during the year\u2014maybe unstable work environment which is medium risk because it could relate to economic stressors affecting his behavior.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) shows substance abuse. Past use can predict future issues, so high risk. His current use during the last month might indicate a potential relapse, increasing the risk further.\n\nYoung age and living with three people urban environment could have contributed to unstable family life, possibly making him more prone to criminal behavior\u2014so medium to high risk.\n\nConsidering God has no role in his life\u2014he seems detached or perhaps influenced by external factors. That could be a red flag indicating he's more likely to engage in self-harming or destructive behaviors, so high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: factors point towards high risk due to substance abuse and possible behavioral issues. My prediction is \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may indicate a developing stage with potential for increased behavior variability but not necessarily an immediate risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race does not directly determine risk, societal factors related to race can influence systemic issues that may affect recidivism rates in this individual's context.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and one conviction suggest a history of behavior that may be relevant to future criminal behavior but do not necessarily indicate an immediate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless combined with other factors such as dependency issues or isolation leading to behavioral instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"\u62e5\u6709GED\u548c\u6b63\u5728\u4e0a\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4e2a\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u518d\u72af\u7387\u76f8\u5173.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u5e74\u5185\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ecf\u5386\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u518d\u72af\u98ce\u9669.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"\u8fc7\u53bb\u56db\u5e74\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u9ebb\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u6709\u836f\u7269\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u518d\u72af\u98ce\u9669.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"\u5728\u5e74\u8f7b\u5e74\u9f84\u65f6\u4e0e biological mother\u4e00\u8d77\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3a3\u3001\u4f4d\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u533a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u672a\u6765\u7684\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"high\", \"\u8868\u793a\u8be5\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0a\u5e1d\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u751f\u6d3b\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u795e\u652f\u6301\u548c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4f24\u5bb3\u6216\u7834\u574f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a.\"), \n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
