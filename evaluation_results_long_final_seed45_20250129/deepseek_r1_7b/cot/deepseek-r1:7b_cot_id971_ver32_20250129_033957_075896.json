    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male reoffending within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but not too old for recidivism. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, so that's definitely a red flag. The GED might show some educational background, but it doesn't necessarily correlate with lower risk if he's currently in college.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which could contribute to isolation or stressors that might lead him back into trouble. His recent drug use, especially marijuana, can have psychological effects like mood swings and decreased motivation, increasing the chance of self-harm or seeking alternative activities.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area suggests he was raised in a non-traditional family environment, which might lead to behavioral issues. His lack of religious belief could affect his coping mechanisms; maybe he turns to other substances or experiences as a substitute for dealing with life's challenges.\n\nThe factors seem to lean towards high risk because of the arrest history, living situation, and recent drug use. Even though he's educated and attending college, those factors might not be enough to offset the other issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think his risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old may indicate a younger individual who could potentially face higher recidivism rates depending on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"high\", \"A single arrest with a conviction is a significant risk factor for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana can lead to altered cognitive functioning and increased susceptibility to stressors or substance abuse triggers.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase feelings of isolation, which could potentially lead to self-harm or seeking alternative activities that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Experiencing living with a biological mother in a household of three suggests a non-traditional upbringing, but this factor alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college may provide some stability, but academic success is not guaranteed without additional support factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job during the past year indicates potential financial instability or dependency on employment for security, which could be a risk factor if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Mood Swings and Stressors\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and experiencing self-harm thoughts may indicate underlying stress or mental health issues that are not directly tied to substance use but can contribute to risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
