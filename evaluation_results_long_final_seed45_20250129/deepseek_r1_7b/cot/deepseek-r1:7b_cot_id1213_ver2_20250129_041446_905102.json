    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 19-year-old female and want me to assess her risk of rearrest within three years using relative weights assigned to each factor.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input data carefully. She's a Black female, age 19, arrested once but not convicted. Her height is 5'6\", weight 190 lbs. Living alone, never married, has a high school diploma and is in college for two years. Worked one job recently, no drug use in the past four years, not depressed in the last month. She remembers living with her biological mother at age 5 in an urban area of five people. She believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nNow, I need to assign risk factors and their weights based on this information. The factors likely include recidivism factors like prior convictions, demographics, living situation, education, employment, substance use, and family background.\n\nStarting with prior arrests: she has one arrest but no conviction. Generally, a single arrest is considered a low risk because it's not a conviction. So maybe \"low\" weight here.\n\nAge: 19. Younger individuals might have more time to learn or make mistakes, so this could be a medium factor if we consider that they may still be in their formative years and could face new challenges.\n\nRace is a significant factor due to systemic issues, but since she's Black, the risk slightly increases. So \"medium\" weight here.\n\nLiving situation: living alone at 19 might seem stable, but given her past living with her mother in a household of five, which was urban, maybe there's some instability. However, she's now living alone and feels okay. Maybe medium to low risk because she's managing well despite the prior experience.\n\nMarital status: never married doesn't directly correlate to recidivism unless she has issues, but since she's single and doing well, perhaps it's a low factor.\n\nEducation: high school diploma plus college is positive\u2014higher education usually reduces recidivism. So \"low\" weight here.\n\nEmployment: one job in the past year. Employment is generally protective, so maybe medium because one job isn't much, but she might be looking for more.\n\nSubstance use: no drugs in four years\u2014that's a strong positive, high weight.\n\nMental health: not depressed last month; good sign, low risk factor.\n\nFamily background: prior living with the biological mother at age 5. This could indicate family dysfunction or environment issues that may affect her behavior later on. So maybe medium to high risk here.\n\nBelief in God: she thinks God plays a role\u2014could be protective, so perhaps a minor positive but not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting this together, the key factors are prior arrest (low), living situation (medium), family background (medium-high). The rest are mostly positive. So her overall risk of rearrest might be low because she's doing well, has good mental and substance use, and education-wise okay. However, her past living arrangement with multiple family members could hint at potential issues.\n\nConsidering everything, I'd lean towards a \"NO\" prediction\u2014she's unlikely to reoffend within three years\u2014but my confidence is only 40% because the high risk from her family background might influence it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which generally indicates low recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age is a minor factor as she is still relatively young and may face new challenges.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may have higher recidivism risk due to systemic issues, though this case shows signs of adjustment.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone after moving from a household of five suggests stable living conditions and good self-management.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married does not directly correlate with recidivism but is considered in the context of personal circumstances.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma plus college enrollment indicates positive educational factors that reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job in the past year, which can be protective but may indicate limited opportunities for re-engagement.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong indicator of substance use prevention and low risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates good mental health and stability.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium-high\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five may indicate potential family dysfunction or environment issues that could affect behavior later on.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God plays a role, which is generally protective and correlates with positive outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
