    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. From what I know, race can influence recidivism, but it's not the main factor. It might be more about systemic issues or other factors.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. Definitely high risk because past convictions are a big indicator of future behavior.\n\nAge is 21, which is relatively young. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates as they enter adulthood, so that's a medium factor here.\n\nGED instead of a degree could mean less employability, increasing his chances to reoffend. So that's high risk.\n\nLiving alone might lead to isolation, but it doesn't directly cause recidivism unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, is concerning. substance abuse can make reoffending easier because of triggers and decreased motivation. Plus, some recent drug use could mean he's still using now, which is high risk.\n\nNot feeling well for the past month adds to the drug use possibility or mental health issues. This could increase his risk since it might affect his ability to manage substance abuse or other behaviors.\n\nYouthful living with a biological mother in an urban area can expose him to environment factors that might influence behavior, but without specific info on that, I'm not sure how much impact there is here.\n\nDenying God as a factor is more about personal belief. If he's not religious and doesn't seek support from faith, it could affect his coping mechanisms with stress or tough situations, possibly increasing risk.\n\nPutting all this together: one arrest, GED, recent drug use, living alone, and emotional state. The factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe risk assessment for the individual indicates several significant risk factors that collectively predict a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. Key factors include past criminal history, substance abuse, lack of higher education, recent drug use, and emotional distress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction make reoffending more likely.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having only a GED instead of a degree can limit employability and opportunities for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, increases the likelihood of future substance abuse and related issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for recent periods may indicate underlying mental health concerns that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly contribute to recidivism but may expose him to environmental factors or isolation which are mitigating factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
