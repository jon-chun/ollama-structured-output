    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male reoffending within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults are more likely to be in their prime for re-offending but also have a lot of potential life ahead. So that might not be too high, maybe medium or low weight.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biasedjujure systems, but this is probably a low impact factor because the data here doesn't show any specific racial disparities mentioned.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That's only once, so it's not a significant number of prior offenses, which might mean lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHeight 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. These are within normal ranges, so no indication of physical comorbidity that could contribute to higher crime rates.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect mental health and social support, but he's young, so maybe not a strong indicator here.\n\nGED and college enrollment. Education is generally protective against recidivism, especially if he's attending college now, which suggests he might be committed to positive change or further education.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability, so this might be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. drug use itself isn't necessarily a strong indicator unless it's more than just occasional. Here, he's using it occasionally but also feels down a lot, which could indicate underlying issues or stressors that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nYoung age at 21 with past trauma living in a household of three in an urban area. Past trauma and family environment can be significant factors. Living with a biological mother suggests a lack of attachment or emotional involvement, which could lead to higher risk.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life indicates spirituality issues, which might correlate with lower self-esteem or higher risk of substance abuse, both linked to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors pointing towards medium to high risk are the drug use and past trauma. Everything else seems positive except perhaps for the drug use. So maybe a 52% confidence level that he'll reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which is relatively young but also in prime years for re-offending.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"There is no specific mention of racial disparities that would increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"low\", \"One arrest and one conviction do not indicate a significant history of criminal behavior beyond this incident.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"The individual's height (5'7\") and weight (140 lbs) are within normal ranges, indicating no physical comorbidity.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age can be isolating but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"holding a GED and enrolled in college indicates educational stability and commitment to positive change, which is protective against recidivism.
