    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male with a White background. Age-wise, being 21 isn't that old, but it's not super young either. Maybe his age is relevant in terms of recidivism rates among his peers.\n\nHe has a criminal history\u2014just one arrest and one conviction. That seems like a solid foundation for recidivism risk because past convictions are a clear indicator of problematic behavior.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll note that as low relevance.\n\n living alone is something to consider. Living with family can provide support which might reduce the risk. But it's still a factor; maybe it's medium relevance because being alone doesn't guarantee higher risk but also isn't safe haven.\n\nNo marriage and living alone\u2014similar reasoning. He's an only child in a household of three, so he had to be somewhat independent from a young age. That might contribute to lower risk as independence is positive, but not entirely safe.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can help with job opportunities and better life choices, which would lower his risk. So that's low relevance because being educated doesn't directly cause issues but helps prevent them.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014employment is usually protective against recidivism unless there are issues with it. Since he has a GED and is in college, maybe he's looking to improve his situation, so this factor might be low.\n\nDrug use history\u2014he used marijuana before and some recent drug use. Drug abuse can lead to unstable behavior or other substance use disorders which could increase risk.\n\nHis current mood\u2014feeling down for extended periods without any coping mechanisms. This could indicate poor mental health, which is a significant risk factor as mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nPast home environment: lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Exposure to that environment early on might have had negative influences like neglect or abuse if the mother wasn't involved, which could contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nReligion\u2014he believes God has no role in his personal life. This lack of religious support might mean he's less likely to seek help for substance abuse or other issues, increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: His factors that increase risk are past drug use, recent negative mood, living alone (with some exceptions), and a lack of strong family support from a young age. The education and college enrollment should help mitigate some risk but aren't enough on their own. The job held might be temporary or not leading to positive outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would assign high relative weight to the risk assessment because multiple factors point towards higher likelihood of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is around 21, which is not particularly young but also not old.
