    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased programming. But since she's young, maybe the impact isn't as strong as in older individuals. So perhaps this factor is low weight.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. Having an arrest without a conviction might mean she hasn't faced the full consequences of her actions. This could lower her risk because she hasn't had significant legal repercussions yet. Maybe medium weight here since it's still a negative but not as severe as a conviction.\n\nAge is 19, which isn't too old, so maybe no immediate high risk factors related to age like being an adult with more life experience that could lead to recidivism. So probably low impact.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. BMI-wise, she's around 23, which is considered normal or slightly above. Being underweight can sometimes be a risk factor, but here it's about average. Maybe no significant weight-related issues, so this might not contribute much to high risk.\n\nLiving alone: No kids, so she's an only child in her household. Living with others reduces supervision and support, which could increase the chances of substance abuse or other issues leading to recidivism. So medium weight here because it's not isolation but living alone as a factor.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma and attending college. Higher education is usually linked to lower recidivism rates because of better job opportunities and higher self-esteem. So this is a protective factor, reducing her risk. Low weight for this factor.\n\nEmployment status: She's working one job. Employment generally reduces the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that might lead to reoffending. So low weight here as well since she has a stable income source.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in past four years. That's positive, reducing risk significantly. High weight because this is a strong protective factor.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Managing mental health can prevent self-harm or substance abuse issues that might lead to more serious offenses. High weight for this reason.\n\nYouth experience: At a young age, lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Being raised in a multi-person household could provide support and stability but might also involve challenges like neglect if not properly supervised. Since she's in an urban area, there could be more stressors or less supervision, which might slightly increase risk, but since it's a positive environment with her biological mother present, maybe this factor is low.\n\nReligion: She believes God has some influence over her life. Religion can provide moral guidance and reduce impulsive behaviors that might lead to recidivism. High weight because of its protective role.\n\nPutting all together: Arrest without conviction (medium), living alone (medium), age 19 (low), no drug use (high), good mental health (high), positive family background (low). The high factors are more influential than the medium and low ones, but since she's Black, which is a risk factor, that might add some weight. However, her positive factors like no drugs and good mental health probably outweigh the others.\n\nSo overall prediction: Low to medium risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black race\", \"low\", \"Race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues.
