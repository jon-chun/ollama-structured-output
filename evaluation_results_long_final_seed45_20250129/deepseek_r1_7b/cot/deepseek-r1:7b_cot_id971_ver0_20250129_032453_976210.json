    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but still considered in his late teens or early twenties. Generally, younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates compared to older adults, so that's a positive sign.\n\nHe identifies as White. From what I know, race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues likejuvenile detention rates being higher for Black youths, but since he's been convicted once and is now 21, maybe the impact has diminished. But it's still something to consider\u2014he might have faced different treatment or experiences in custody.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are a strong predictor of future offenses. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise red flags regarding substance use or other indicators, so maybe no direct impact here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but he has the means to be in college, so perhaps he's self-sufficient enough that this isn't a major issue.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. A GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities or further education, which could lower recidivism risk compared to those without it. His current enrollment is positive for his situation.\n\nHe held one job during the year; that's manageable and shows he can function economically, which isn't a red flag.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. This could indicate substance abuse issues, which often correlate with higher recidivism rates because of potential self-harm or other related behaviors. That's a high factor.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014maybe he was exposed to family dynamics that aren't conducive to positive development. Urban environments can sometimes have higher stress levels, and living with siblings might have led to emotional neglect or other issues. The mention of God not influencing his life could suggest a lack of religious support, which some studies show may impact recidivism rates differently.\n\nConsidering all these factors: Prior conviction (high), substance use (high), family background (moderate), and living situation (low). The job and GED are positive but might not outweigh the negatives. So putting it together, his risk is pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals generally have lower recidivism rates, but this individual's age may still be a factor depending on other factors like prior convictions and family background.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence recidivism, the individual has been convicted once and is now 21, which may mitigate any systemic effects associated with race in previous contexts.\")\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"One prior conviction significantly increases the risk of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years along with recent feelings of low mood suggests potential substance abuse issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background/Living Situation\", \"moderate\", \"Living alone at a young age in a family of three in an urban area may have had negative influences, while being enrolled in college and employed shows some positive aspects.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
