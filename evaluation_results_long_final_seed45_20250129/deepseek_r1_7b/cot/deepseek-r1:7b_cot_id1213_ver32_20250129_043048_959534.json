    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help this user by assessing the risk of a 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which might indicate she's just out of high school and possibly still developing her skills. She has one arrest but no conviction, so maybe she's in the process of rebuilding her record. Her weight and height don't seem directly related to recidivism, so that factor is probably low.\n\nShe's living alone, which could mean she might not have the same support network as someone living with others. Divorce or separation isn't mentioned, but since she's 19, it's unlikely she would be in a relationship at this point. Her education level is high school diploma and she's attending college, which usually indicates responsible behavior.\n\nShe's never married, so no conjugal stressors to consider here. Having one job during the year might show stability, though her low education might affect job performance. No drug use for four years is a positive sign. Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests she's mentally stable, which is good news.\n\nHer living situation at a young age: she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That could introduce family dynamics or social factors that might influence her behavior now. Her belief in God is a positive sign for mental health and personal well-being.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors seem mixed but lean towards low risk. No recent substance abuse, stable employment, good mental health, and a clean living history contribute to lower recidivism chances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19, which may indicate she is just out of high school and potentially still developing her skills and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, suggesting she is in the process of rebuilding her record.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years, which indicates a clean behavior history that may correlate with lower risk of substance abuse issues in the future.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, but her mental health status could still influence her decision-making and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"She is currently living alone, which may suggest she has some independence and responsibility that could correlate with lower risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating a level of education that may provide her with better opportunities and skills that reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She has held one job during the year; while employment can correlate with lower recidivism risk, her relatively low educational attainment might mean she faces challenges in maintaining stable employment in the future.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area could introduce social and family dynamics that may influence her behavior and decision-making in the future.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
