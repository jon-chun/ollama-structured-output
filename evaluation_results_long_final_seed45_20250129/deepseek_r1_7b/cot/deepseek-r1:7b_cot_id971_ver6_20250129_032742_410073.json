    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger offenders often have different behaviors compared to older ones. Generally, younger individuals might be more impressionable and could potentially make different choices as they grow older, which might lower the risk a bit compared to someone older with more life experience.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race plays a direct role in recidivism here since he's already been convicted once. So maybe that factor isn't as significant now.\n\nHe has a criminal history of one arrest and one conviction. That's not a lot, so it might not be super high on the risk scale, but it's still there. One conviction can increase the risk compared to someone with no history.\n\nHeight is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like this have much impact unless there are specific health issues mentioned, which aren't here. So probably a low or medium factor.\n\nLiving alone isn't married and currently living alone. Single individuals might face different stressors compared to those in relationships, but since he's not married yet, maybe that's not the primary concern here.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education can be both positive and negative depending on it. A GED shows some commitment, which could lead to better job opportunities and higher earnings, reducing recidivism risk. But if he isn't completing his education or using it for legitimate purposes, that's another story.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism because having a stable income can help support family and reduce stress. However, only holding one job might indicate some challenges in finding better opportunities, which could be a moderate factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. Past drug use can sometimes be linked to more serious offenses or substance abuse issues, which can increase risk if he's using other substances now. But since he only mentions marijuana and hasn't used anything else recently, maybe it's a low factor.\n\nHe felt down for most of the past month. Emotional distress could lead to impulsive behaviors that might contribute to recidivism. However, if he's seeking help or considering changing his mindset, this might lower the risk.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have both positive and negative outcomes. Urban environments sometimes offer more opportunities but could also be linked to higher crime rates or family issues that might affect him negatively.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life, which might indicate a lack of religious support system. Without that, he might rely on other social networks, like friends or the criminal justice system, which can have mixed outcomes.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors that increase risk are one prior conviction and living alone without a strong support network. The positive factors are education, current job, and limited drug use but recent emotional distress. The negative factors related to his upbringing might introduce some uncertainty.\n\nI think the overall risk is medium because while he has some mitigating factors like education and employment, there's still a history of offense and living in a somewhat challenging household without strong family support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals may be more impressionable and could make different choices as they grow older, potentially lowering the risk compared to older offenders.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"low\", \"One prior conviction does not indicate a high risk but serves as a minor mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a strong support network may increase stress and potential for substance abuse or negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college can positively influence future outcomes by providing opportunities for better employment.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests some stability, though it may indicate challenges in seeking more sustainable employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use without recent substance abuse is not strongly associated with increased risk but should be monitored for any signs of relapse or new substance use.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"moderate\", \"Recent emotional distress could lead to impulsive behaviors, though seeking help may indicate a potential change in mindset.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may offer opportunities but can also be linked to higher crime rates or family issues that might negatively affect outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
