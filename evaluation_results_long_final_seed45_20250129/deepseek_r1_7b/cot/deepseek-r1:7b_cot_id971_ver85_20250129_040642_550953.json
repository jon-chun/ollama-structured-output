    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because prior convictions are a big indicator of future criminal behavior. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHis age is 21, which isn't too old yet, but it's also not young enough to make him immune to recidivism. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, so maybe some higher education could help with job opportunities or stability. But he's only been out of prison once; if he's currently employed or studying, that might lower the risk compared to someone with more history. So perhaps low to medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support system, which might be a bit concerning, but it doesn't automatically make him a risk. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is a red flag, especially since he admits to marijuana and recent feelings of low mood. Drug use can impair judgment and lead to more impulsive behavior, increasing recidivism chances. That's probably high risk.\n\nHis early life was tough, living with his mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. This indicates instability and possible neglect, which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. High risk here too.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so maybe he has a more deterministic view of life, possibly leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if not properly supported. That's another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), age (medium), education and college (low-medium), living alone (medium), drug use (high), tough early life (high), lack of God belief (high). So the overall risk is pretty high, but maybe leaning towards yes with confidence around 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, while still relatively young, this age group can still exhibit recidivist tendencies despite having recent legal history.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college with a GED; higher education may provide better opportunities and reduce recidivism risk if employed or completing education successfully.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not automatically increase risk but lacks the support that could mitigate potential negative behaviors associated with living circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Admission to drug use in the past four years, along with recent feelings of low mood, can impair judgment and lead to impulsive decisions contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Instability\", \"high\", \"Early life living situation indicates potential for neglect or unstable family dynamics, which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Denying a belief in God may influence risk-takers' behaviors towards substance abuse or neglecting responsibilities without guidance from a higher power.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
