    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger adults are generally less likely to reoffend compared to older individuals who have had more life experiences that might push them toward criminal behavior. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. From what I know, race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like differential treatment in the justice system and socioeconomic disparities. But at 21, especially if he's just starting out, this might not be as significant yet. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nConvictions: He has one. One conviction is a solid indicator of past behavior that could influence future actions. So high risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly relevant to reoffending unless there's something about his physical health, but nothing in the data suggests he's in poor health or has health issues related to his criminal history. So low risk here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect mental health and social support. If he's living alone at 21, that might be a red flag for potential isolation leading to substance abuse or other issues. Medium risk factor because while it's not directly about criminal behavior, it could impact his overall well-being which in turn might influence recidivism.\n\nGED certificate: Having a high school equivalency can sometimes lead to better job opportunities and stable living situations, so that actually reduces the risk. Low risk factor.\n\nEnrolled in a 4-year college: Education is a strong positive predictor of lower recidivism because it provides future goals and potential earnings, which are linked to lower likelihood of reoffending. High confidence here; this should significantly reduce risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. One job might be enough for stability, but if he's been unemployed or underemployed before, that could indicate past instability. But since it's just one job, maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to criminal behavior like theft or illegal activities. High risk factor here because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nFeeling down might indicate underlying mental health issues. If he's feeling this way sometimes, it could be a sign of depression or anxiety, both of which are linked to higher recidivism. Medium-high risk factor due to the emotional distress potentially leading to more risky behavior.\n\nLiving at an early age with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a context might have had negative influences like exposure to violence or substance abuse, but since he's 21 now and presumably has moved out, maybe this has less impact. Still, it could be a low or medium risk depending on how much influence that environment still has.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life: This belief might correlate with certain types of behavior, possibly more rebellious or impulsive, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Medium risk factor because while his faith might not directly cause crime, it could affect his personal decision-making and risk-taking.\n\nPutting it all together: The high school education is a strong positive, but other factors like drug use, living situation, and belief in God without meaning are significant negatives. The presence of a conviction and being White (though at 21) still contribute to higher risk. However, his current stable educational pursuits might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nSo overall, I would predict that he has a high chance of rearrest within three years, but with some mitigation from his education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults are generally less likely to reoffend compared to older individuals who have had more life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates, at this early stage in life, it may not be as significant as other factors.\",\n     \"The person is White.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"A conviction increases the risk of reoffending as past behavior often influences future actions.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 might indicate potential isolation, which could lead to substance abuse issues or other problems that may influence recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college reduces the risk of reoffending as education provides future goals and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year might suggest past instability, which could be linked to higher recidivism rates if there was prior unemployment or underemployment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Admission to marijuana use and feelings of low mood indicate potential substance abuse issues, which are strong indicators of high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"F frequent feelings of low mood could suggest underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety, both linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area at a young age might have had negative influences but likely less impact now that he has moved out.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Not believing in God could correlate with rebellious or impulsive behavior, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
