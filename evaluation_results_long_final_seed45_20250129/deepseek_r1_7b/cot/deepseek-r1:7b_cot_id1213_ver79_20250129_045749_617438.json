    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger adults are generally at a lower risk of reoffending compared to older individuals because they're still developing their decision-making skills and life experiences might be limited. But it's also true that being in the early 20s can mean high potential for new opportunities or mistakes.\n\nShe identifies as Black, which is an important factor. Historically, Black individuals have had higher rearrest rates compared to White individuals, possibly due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased law enforcement. So this could be a significant risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single non-convicted arrest might indicate she's aware of her actions' consequences or is actively working on turning her life around. However, if the system hasn't treated her fairly, it could still impact her trust in the judicial system, which affects recidivism risk assessments.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 190 lbs, but I don't see how these factors directly influence recidivism unless there's a specific job or role she's in that might have safety implications. Since no such information is provided, maybe this isn't relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living solitarily can reduce social support, which might increase the risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors if she doesn't have accountability from others. However, it could also be a sign of self-reliance or strong personal drive to avoid trouble.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college for two years. Education is generally protective against recidivism because higher education often correlates with better job opportunities, financial stability, and social connections. However, the fact that she's still attending college might suggest she's motivated but hasn't yet secured a stable path.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job isn't enough to ensure steady income or reduced risk of engaging in illegal activities. However, if she had a good job with decent pay and benefits, it could be protective. Without knowing more about her work history, I can only assume it's not particularly stable.\n\nNo recent drug use in the past four years shows she's been proactive in avoiding substance abuse, which is a strong protective factor against recidivism. Substance abuse is often linked to higher risk of criminal behavior, so not using drugs could be a significant mitigating factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, indicating good mental health. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but if she's managing her mental well-being, it's another positive indicator for not reoffending.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. While living with multiple family members might provide support and stability initially, growing up in a large household could also lead to different social dynamics or stressors that might affect her likelihood of reoffending. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that's something to consider.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has influence over her life. Religious beliefs can provide guidance and structure but may also influence behavior if she's using religion as a crutch for decision-making or avoiding negative choices. It might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there's evidence of poor spiritual practices leading to bad decisions.\n\nPutting all these together, while some factors like being Black and living in an urban area could increase the risk, other protective factors like education, no drug use, and good mental health are significant mitigators. The single non-convicted arrest might also be seen as a positive step towards reducing future risk.\n\nSo, considering both protective and mitigating factors, I think her risk of rearrest is low but not zero. She has clear signs of self-motivation and support systems, which help reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults generally have a lower risk of recidivism due to their developing cognitive skills and life experiences.
