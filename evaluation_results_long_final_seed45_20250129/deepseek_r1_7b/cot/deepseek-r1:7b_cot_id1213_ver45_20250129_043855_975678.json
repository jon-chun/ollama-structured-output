    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her lack of prior convictions is a positive sign. She has one arrest but no conviction, so that's not adding any weight. However, being young (19) might mean she's still developing her skills and life choices could change.\n\nShe identifies as Black, which isn't directly a risk factor, but systemic issues in the justice system can impact recidivism rates, especially for minority groups. I'll note this as low to medium weight.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about behavior and circumstances.\n\nLiving alone is neutral, as it could be a protective factor or a risk depending on surrounding environments, but in this case, no strong indicators.\n\nHigh school diploma with college enrollment suggests she has some education and might have better job opportunities. That\u2019s a mitigating factor\u2014low to medium weight.\n\nOne job during the year isn't bad, though having more stable employment could help prevent recidivism if she's currently employed.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of stability. Low risk here.\n\nNot feeling depressed for a month shows she's mentally stable. That\u2019s another mitigating factor\u2014low weight.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This might suggest she has experienced family living conditions, which could be a minor issue but not significant enough to increase risk.\n\nHer belief in God indicates strong moral values and support system, which is protective\u2014low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions are good, education is positive, stable employment, and good behavior. The only factors that might slightly increase risk are systemic issues related to her race and living with a large family. However, these are minor compared to the mitigating factors.\n\nSo, I'd assign low relative weight to each factor. Her overall risk of rearrest in three years is probably low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one prior arrest but no conviction, which reduces her recidivism risk compared to someone with a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area and being Black may be associated with systemic issues that could impact recidivism rates, but this factor is neutral given other mitigating factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She is employed full-time or part-time and has held one job during the past year, which provides stability and opportunities for positive behavior changes.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating a clean record that supports responsible decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, showing mental stability and resilience that can prevent recidivism triggers.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five suggests she may have experienced family support or challenges but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating education stability that can contribute to positive life choices.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 19 years old may seem isolating but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk without other negative factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
