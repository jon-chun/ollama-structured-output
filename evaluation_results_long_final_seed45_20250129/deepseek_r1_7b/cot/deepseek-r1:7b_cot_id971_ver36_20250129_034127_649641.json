    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive or have less life experience, which might influence their ability to make responsible decisions. But since he has a history of being enrolled in college and working a job, that might mitigate some of the negative factors related to being younger.\n\nHe's White, but I don't see any systemic issues tied to race here unless there are other factors not mentioned, like prior convictions from different communities. He's been convicted once, which is a significant factor because prior convictions increase the risk of recidivism. So that's probably high weight.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant, so I'll note they're irrelevant. Next, he's never married and living alone. Being single can sometimes lead to higher stress or substance use issues, but again, without more context on his living situation stability, it might be low impact compared to other factors like drug use.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's actively trying to improve himself educationally. That's generally positive and could indicate better job opportunities and lower risk of reoffending, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Having a steady job can help with financial stability and reduce the need for criminal involvement, but not having any prior convictions might make this less of an issue compared to other factors.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is moderate. Past drug use can lead to underlying issues like mental health problems or substance abuse, which could increase recidivism risk. The recent feelings of low mood and depression mentioned could exacerbate this. So this factor might have a high weight.\n\nYounger age (21) can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism because of being in the early stages of life where impulse control is lower. But he's actively trying to get an education, so that might counteract some of the negative factors.\n\nLiving alone at a young age and considering God has no role could lead him to seek help or support through other means, but without more context on his mental health services access, it's hard to say how significant this is. It might be low weight compared to drug use.\n\nThe mention that he feels down and uses marijuana suggests possible underlying mental health issues which can increase the risk of reoffending after incarceration. That would probably have a high weight.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), mental health indicators (high). The job, education, living situation, and age might be medium or low. \n\nSo overall prediction is high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly with feelings of low mood and depression, can lead to mental health issues that increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Indicators\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and considering God has no role indicates potential mental health challenges that could influence decision-making after incarceration.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
