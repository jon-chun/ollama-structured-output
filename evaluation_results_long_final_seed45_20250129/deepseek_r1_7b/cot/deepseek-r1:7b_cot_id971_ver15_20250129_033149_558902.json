    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which isn't too high yet. He has a GED, which usually indicates some education and might suggest he's been through school but not necessarily higher education. Being in college could be beneficial or could mean he's still focused on improving himself.\n\nHe has a past of criminal behavior\u2014he's been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, so that definitely raises the risk level. Prior convictions are typically strong indicators of recidivism because they show a history of breaking the law again.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight is 140 lbs. I don't think these physical attributes directly contribute to recidivism risk unless there's something about his health that could affect his ability to reintegrate, but nothing here suggests he's in poor health or has a history of substance abuse beyond the drug use mentioned.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living with someone can provide support and stability, so living alone might indicate some level of social isolation, which could be a risk factor because he might struggle to find help if needed.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, but only recently felt down. Drug use isn't always a direct cause of recidivism, but it can contribute indirectly by affecting mental health or relationships. Since he's been using for some time now, it could mean ongoing dependency issues.\n\nHe has a history of trauma since a young age living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's a significant risk factor because trauma at such a young age often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to emotional and behavioral challenges that can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might not have strong spiritual support, which could impact his ability to seek help or maintain positive relationships. A lack of religious support might contribute to other risk factors like substance abuse or unstable living situations.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction (high), drug use (medium), living alone (medium), trauma history (high), GED in college but not a degree (low). The trauma is likely the strongest factor here, so I'd lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple risk factors that contribute to a high likelihood of rearrest. His prior criminal history and trauma significantly increase his risk, while other factors like living alone and drug use are moderate contributors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"His single prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Trauma History\", \"high\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of three since a young age, coupled with his belief that God has no role in his life, indicates potential emotional and behavioral challenges contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use and recent feelings of low mood may indicate ongoing substance abuse issues which can contribute to risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 can lead to social isolation, which may affect access to support networks that could aid in reintegration and avoiding criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
