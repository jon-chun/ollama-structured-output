    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is relatively young but still a risk if she's not in college or has opportunities ahead. She hasn't been convicted yet, just arrested once\u2014so maybe she's trying to turn her life around.\n\nShe identifies as Black, and according to some studies, Black individuals might have higher rearrest rates due to systemic issues like poverty and lack of access to resources. That could lean towards a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height is 5'6\", weight 190 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out about her physical condition that would directly impact recidivism.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which might suggest she's independent but could also mean she's dealing with some stressors on her own. Maybe she has a support system at home or friends nearby.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college shows she's committed to further education, which is usually a positive sign for employment and stability. That should be low risk.\n\nShe held only one job in the past year\u2014maybe she's still transitioning into a career or perhaps it was temporary. Having that one job might show some responsibility, but if it was recent, maybe she's looking to improve her situation further.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month\u2014very positive factors indicating good mental health and substance abuse control. That should reduce risk significantly.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five, which is quite large. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or social issues that might affect someone from such a household. Also, living with multiple family members could mean she's dealing with more responsibilities but also potential emotional strain if things aren't ideal at home.\n\nConsidering her faith, she believes God plays a role in her life. That strong moral support could be a positive factor, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Age is on the younger side, but her educational background and lack of drug use are strong positives. The living situation with five family members might add some challenges but isn't inherently bad. Her Black identity could introduce some systemic issues that others might not have faced as strongly before. She's relatively stable in employment and living alone.\n\nI think overall, the risk is low because she has many positive factors like education, job experience, mental health, and strong family background. The only negatives are her age and being Black, but those don't seem to tip it into a medium or high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19, which might indicate she has opportunities ahead that could lead to positive changes in her life, reducing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Black Identity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic challenges related to poverty and lack of access to resources, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five suggests she has a stable living environment, which is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year, indicating some level of stability and responsibility that can contribute to positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Her lack of depression and drug use in the past four years indicates good mental health and substance abuse control, which are strong protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Attainment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college shows commitment to further education and potential for future stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
