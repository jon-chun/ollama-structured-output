    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals might have less established lives, which could mean higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and experiences. So that's a medium weight factor.\n\nHe has a White identity. I know there can be disparities based on race in the criminal justice system, so this adds some risk. That's another medium factor.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted, which is definitely a high risk since past convictions are a clear indicator of past behavior that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight is 140 lbs. I'm not sure how body type affects recidivism directly, but maybe it's more about other factors like health or substance use which he has mentioned.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can influence his stability and access to support, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so this is probably a low weight.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment generally reduces recidivism because having a stable income can provide motivation to change behavior. So that's another medium factor.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years, which could indicate substance abuse issues. The more recent drug use (last month) might be an indicator of current substance use, which is concerning and adds high risk.\n\nHe feels down often and can't find comfort without drugs, showing possible mental health issues or substance dependence. That's a high factor because it suggests underlying problems that could lead to relapse.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Raising in such an environment might have social or emotional challenges but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are specific issues like abuse, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might affect his mental health and ability to seek help, increasing risk slightly as a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The high factors are definitely the prior arrest, drug use, and belief in no higher power. Medium factors include age, living alone, job holding, and possibly the GED. The low is education level. So overall, considering these, his risk of rearrest seems quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have less established lives, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Potential racial disparities in the criminal justice system could influence risk.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Past convictions are strong indicators of potential reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can lead to relapse and increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Substance Dependence\", \"high\", \"Current feelings and drug use suggest underlying issues that could impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living situation may affect stability and support access, contributing to moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (GED)\", \"low\", \"Higher education often correlates with better job opportunities reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides motivation for change.\"),\n    (\"Raising in a Household of Three in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Potential social or emotional challenges but no direct recidivism link unless issues like abuse are present.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God (No Higher Power)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual support might affect mental health and seeking help, increasing risk slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
