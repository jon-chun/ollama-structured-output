    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this person's risk of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals might have more potential for change or relapse. So that could be a medium weight factor.\n\nNext, his race is White. From what I know, being White doesn't inherently make someone more or less likely to recidivize, but it's important to note without any bias. Maybe no direct impact here unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. One prior offense isn't terrible, but it does indicate some criminal history which could increase risk.\n\nHeight is 5'7\" \u2013 not sure if that plays into recidivism directly, so probably low weight.\n\nWeight of 140 lbs seems normal for his height; no indication from the data provided to suggest he's overweight or underweight.\n\nLiving alone: Living situation can influence support and access to resources. But since he's living on his own, maybe it's a medium factor because while he has some independence, he might lack support systems that could aid in avoiding recidivism.\n\nNo marriage and no children mentioned \u2013 so he's an adult without family presence, which might be another medium risk factor as family can provide stability.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates because it offers more opportunities and less time in prison. So that could be low weight.\n\nHe held one job during the year \u2013 having some employment history is positive, as it shows responsibility and possible future earnings which can contribute to stability. That might be medium or low depending on the context.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before but not recently. However, he felt down for a while in the past month. Persistent feelings of depression could be a risk factor if it's ongoing. The recent drug use (even if only marijuana) might indicate a willingness to engage in risky behavior again. That seems high.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological mother: Exposure to adverse childhood experiences can increase recidivism risk. Being in an urban area adds another layer, as higher crime rates could provide more opportunities for issues like substance abuse or other criminal activities. So this is definitely a high factor.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life might influence his motivation towards positive change. Without religious support, he might rely on other factors like social support, which isn't mentioned here, so maybe slightly medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: The main risk factors are the drug use (high), exposure to adverse childhood conditions (high), and lack of strong family or religious support. These would significantly increase his risk. Other factors like prior arrest and GED have moderate influence but aren't as significant.\n\nSo, my prediction is a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may indicate more potential for change or relapse.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No direct impact unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior offense indicates some criminal history but doesn't guarantee future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism risk based on the given data.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Normal weight for his height, no indication of obesity or underweight issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living situation may influence support and access to resources but doesn't directly correlate with higher risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"No Marriage/Children\", \"medium\", \"Lack of family presence can affect stability but doesn't inherently increase risk without other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and enrolled in college generally correlates with lower recidivism rates due to educational opportunities and responsible living.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"One job history shows some responsibility, which can contribute to stability but isn't a mitigating factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of depression may indicate ongoing risk factors for substance abuse and related issues.\"),\n    (\"Adverse Childhood Experience\", \"high\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area, especially at a young age, is a significant risk factor due to potential exposure to adverse conditions and higher crime rates which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has no role may influence motivation towards positive change but isn't directly correlated with higher risk without additional context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
