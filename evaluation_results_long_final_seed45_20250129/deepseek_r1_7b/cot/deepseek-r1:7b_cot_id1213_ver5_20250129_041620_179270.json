    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 19 years old with a high school diploma. Younger age and education might mean less responsibility, so that could be low risk.\n\nShe identifies as Black, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there are systemic issues, which the data doesn't mention, so maybe medium or no impact.\n\nHer past: one arrest not convicted\u2014so she's been in custody once. But since it's an arrest and not a conviction, maybe that's less severe than a full conviction, but still some risk.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and 190 lbs\u2014no info on weight vs height issues or health problems, so probably low impact.\n\nLiving alone is stable living situation; no one to fall back on, so low risk there.\n\nHigh school diploma with college enrollment suggests she's motivated. College can lead to better opportunities, so maybe lower risk of reoffending.\n\nOne job\u2014she's working, which might indicate stability and less time for substance abuse or crime.\n\nNo drug use in past four years\u2014that\u2019s a strong positive indicator; low risk here.\n\nNo recent depression\u2014mental health is good, which is another positive factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a larger family environment, but it doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism unless there are underlying issues not mentioned.\n\nShe believes in God and feels has something to do with her life\u2014spiritual factors can sometimes provide support and discipline, so maybe low risk due to that belief.\n\nPutting this all together: no major red flags. She has a clean record, stable living situation, good education, employment, and positive personal circumstances. These factors point towards lower recidivism risk over three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 19 is relatively young, which may indicate less life experience and responsibility, suggesting a lower risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating ongoing education and possibly better job opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction.
