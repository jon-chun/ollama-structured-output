    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history\u2014only one arrest and a conviction. That's not great but also not super high. So maybe medium risk from that alone.\n\nHe's White, which might have some racial disparities in the justice system, but I don't know if it directly affects his recidivism rate here. Probably low impact.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. Body type isn't a factor unless there's something about it, but since no info on it, probably irrelevant\u2014low weight.\n\nNever married living alone. That's common among young adults, so maybe not much of a risk factor either\u2014another low.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Completion of higher education can reduce recidivism because people are more likely to seek better opportunities. So that's good, maybe lowers the risk\u2014not high.\n\nOnly held one job during the year. Job stability is important; having at least some steady work could help prevent unemployment leading to more crime\u2014so medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can be a significant factor because it impairs judgment and increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, so that's high risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That might have some association with higher recidivism due to exposure to home environment issues\u2014medium risk.\n\nDoesn't believe in God; could be associated with certain types of behavior or stress, but I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism. Maybe low impact here.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning factors are the drug use (high) and living situation (medium). The rest don't contribute much negative. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and a conviction indicate some past involvement in the legal system, which can be a risk factor but not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Racial background may have some impact on the justice system outcomes, but without specific data, its effect is considered low here.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"No relevant information provided about body type or health issues affecting risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 could be a source of stress but is common among young adults; no immediate high-risk implication.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests potential for positive change, which might lower risk rather than increase it.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Employment history can influence stability; one job may not be sufficient to prevent future issues but isn't necessarily high risk either.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially recent and intense feelings of low mood, significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age may have contributed to behavioral issues or stress but isn't definitively high risk without further data.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
