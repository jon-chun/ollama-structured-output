    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know that race can influence recidivism rates because of systemic issues like over-policing and biased practices. Since she hasn't been convicted yet but has an arrest, her race might mean she's at a slightly higher risk compared to her white peers with similar circumstances.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor in recidivism unless it relates to substance use or health issues. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Drug use can sometimes lead to other crimes, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe's not married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since she has high school and is college enrolled, she might have some stability. Not being married doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are family issues or lack of support networks elsewhere.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college shows she has education, which usually correlates with lower recidivism because education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. That's a low risk factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job experience can be beneficial as having work experience might reduce recidivism. However, having just one job in a year doesn't necessarily guarantee stability or higher earnings, so it's on the lower side but still positive.\n\nNo drug use and no depression in the past month. These are both strong negatives for recidivism. Not using drugs reduces the risk of substance abuse-related crimes, and lack of recent depression suggests she's mentally stable.\n\nHer young age is another point. Younger individuals might have more impulsive decisions or less life experience that could lead to criminal behavior later on. Being 19 isn't a long time since release from arrest, so her recidivism risk might still be elevated compared to older adults with similar stats.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates due to various social and economic factors. Urban settings might have different dynamics that could contribute to higher recidivism, but it's not directly tied unless there are issues like lack of supervision or family dysfunction.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. That's a positive factor because religious beliefs can provide support and guidance, reducing the likelihood of self-harm or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: The factors that pull her towards higher risk (like being Black) are somewhat offset by strong protective factors like education, no drug use, and stable living situation. However, her age might still make her more prone to making impulsive decisions. So overall, I'd rate her as a low to medium risk. Maybe a 30% confidence that she'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black race\", \"high\", \"Race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased practices, potentially increasing risk compared to white peers with similar circumstances.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"No drug use reduces the risk of substance abuse-related crimes which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are underlying family issues or lack of support networks elsewhere.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Education typically correlates with lower recidivism due to better job opportunities and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"One job in past year\", \"low\", \"Having a job experience is generally positive, though one job might not provide the necessary stability or earnings for long-term success.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent depression suggests mental stability which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Young age (19)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have more impulsive decisions and less life experience potentially leading to higher recidivism later on.\"),\n    (\"Household size 5 with biological mother in urban area at young age\", \"high\", \"Large households can correlate with higher crime rates due to various social and economic factors, though not directly tied unless there are issues like lack of supervision or family dysfunction.\"),\n    (\"Believes God has something to do with personal life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs provide support and guidance which can reduce the likelihood of self-harm or criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
