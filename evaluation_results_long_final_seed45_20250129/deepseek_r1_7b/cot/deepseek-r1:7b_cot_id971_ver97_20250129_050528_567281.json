    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. Racial factors can play a role in recidivism rates due to systemic issues, but since he's young and has only one prior conviction, maybe it won't be too significant here.\n\nHe has a GED and is going to college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because people are more likely to get job training or support. So that's probably low risk.\n\nNot being married and living alone might mean he doesn't have the same level of support as someone with a partner. Maybe medium risk because living arrangements can affect access to resources and emotional support.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, which isn't severe, but drug use is linked to higher recidivism due to possible substance abuse issues or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nHis current mood seems really low, maybe indicating depression or stress, which could contribute to substance use and poor decision-making. That might push his risk up a bit.\n\nHe was a single parent from a young age in an urban area. That's tough\u2014parenting challenges can lead to higher stress and maybe more criminal behavior. Plus, living in an urban area might mean less stable living conditions or higher exposure to negative influences.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his life could mean he lacks religious support, which might reduce the effectiveness of community or family support systems, increasing risk slightly.\n\nPutting it all together: education is good, but other factors like living alone, drug use, and family background are concerning. The mood issues add to potential stressors. So overall, I think he's at a medium risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"low\", \"While being White may have systemic advantages in certain areas, this individual is young and has only one prior conviction, which suggests a lower baseline risk compared to older individuals with more convictions or longer prison terms.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
