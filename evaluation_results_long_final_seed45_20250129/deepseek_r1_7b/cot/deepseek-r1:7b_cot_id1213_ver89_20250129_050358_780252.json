    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors like over-policing and biased law enforcement. So that might be a medium weight factor because it's important but not the most direct risk indicator.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That's probably a low weight because being arrested without a conviction doesn't directly correlate with future crime unless there are other issues, which we don't know yet.\n\nHer height and weight aren't relevant here, so that should be low.\n\nNo family history of criminal behavior suggests she's not part of an at-risk family, so another low factor.\n\nShe's living alone. Living in a stable home environment is usually positive, but if there are issues like neglect or abuse elsewhere, it could change things. Still, this is low because she's on her own without any reported problems.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment\u2014usually indicates responsible behavior, so that's probably a low risk factor since education is linked to lower recidivism.\n\nShe held one job last year. That shows some stability, which might reduce risk, but the fact that it was only one job could mean she's unemployed or underemployed, which isn't clear yet. Maybe medium because job status can vary widely in impact on recidivism.\n\nNo drug use and no recent depression\u2014positive factors that usually correlate with lower risk. So low here too.\n\nYoung age at last arrest: 19 years old is quite young, so recidivism might be higher if she's repeating issues as an adult. That could be a medium factor because younger adults sometimes have more impulsive behavior or lack life experience leading to reoffending.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area\u2014so she experienced a lot of family stress and possibly abuse. This is probably high risk because family environment, especially in larger households with potential neglect, can be a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\nShe believes in God\u2014I don't think spirituality alone has a strong link to recidivism unless it affects her motivation towards positive behavior, but I'm not sure if that's reliable here. Maybe medium or low weight since it's subjective.\n\nPutting all this together: one high risk factor (family) and some other factors of varying influence. The high family risk could outweigh the others, so maybe a 40% confidence level for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic barriers that can influence recidivism rates due to factors like over-policing and biased law enforcement.
