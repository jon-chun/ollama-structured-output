    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has only been arrested once but not convicted. I know that a single arrest without a conviction might still show some risk because it could indicate other issues or maybe she was released with supervision. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. That\u2019s a bit on the heavier side, but not super concerning unless there are health issues. No info on BMI, so I'll consider this as low to moderate impact\u2014probably a low weight factor.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living with family can provide support and reduce stress, which might lower risk factors related to living situation. So maybe medium or low here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it offers better opportunities. So this should be a mitigating factor\u2014low risk weight.\n\nOnly one job during the year. Job stability can influence reoffending, so having at least some employment might reduce risk compared to someone unemployed. Maybe medium?\n\nNo recent drug use in four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators that she's in good mental health and not using drugs, which are strong risk factors for recidivism. So high mitigating factors\u2014low or no risk.\n\nShe was living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Large households can sometimes lead to more stress or less supervision, but being raised by her mother might provide emotional support. Maybe medium impact here.\n\nShe believes in God and feels He has something to do with her life. Religious beliefs can contribute positively by offering coping mechanisms, so this is likely a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions, education, job, good health\u2014these are positive signs that might actually lower the risk rather than increase it. The single arrest could be a minor issue without conviction, and living with family supports her well. So overall, I think she's at a low to medium risk of rearrest.\n\nWait, but recidivism models often look for factors like previous convictions, reoffending potential, etc. Since she has no prior convictions, that's actually a strong point. The arrest might not be significant unless it was severe. Her job and education are positive too. So maybe her risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"Her single non-convicted arrest may indicate other issues, so medium risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living with family can reduce stress, so moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and College\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest good opportunities, low risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"One job during the year may show some stability but not a mitigating factor entirely.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use/ Depression\", \"low\", \"No use in four years and no depression in the past month indicate good mental health, low risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with her mother in a large household might provide support but could also have challenges, moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may offer coping mechanisms, so low risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
