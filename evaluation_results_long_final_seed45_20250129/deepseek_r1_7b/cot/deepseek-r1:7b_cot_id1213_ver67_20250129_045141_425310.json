    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the risk of this 19-year-old female having recidivism within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history but it's not a conviction. That alone might lower her risk since convictions are more impactful than just an arrest. So maybe that's low or medium.\n\nHer race is Black, which historically can be associated with higher recidivism rates in the US, so that could be high. But she's only been arrested once and not convicted, so maybe mitigated.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight isn't a direct risk factor unless it's related to health issues. She hasn't used drugs or felt depressed recently, which are positive indicators for low risk.\n\nShe's living alone, which can be safer than cohabiting or being in a household with someone she trusts less. No previous marriages and no kids either, so family support isn't an issue here.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college show she has some education and is committed to her future. Employing one job during the year suggests stability but maybe not enough for full-time work yet.\n\nBiological mother living in a household of five in an urban area could have social and economic challenges, possibly affecting her. But since she's living alone now, that might be less of a factor unless there are other issues related to that environment.\n\nHer religious affiliation might provide support systems or coping mechanisms against stressors, which can help prevent recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: The only high risk factors are her Black race and the family history from living with five biological parents in an urban area. Everything else seems positive. So maybe a 40% confidence she'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history (not convicted)\", \"low\", \"Her criminal history includes one arrest, but it is not a conviction, which may lower her risk compared to someone with a conviction alone.\"),\n    (\"race (Black)\", \"high\", \"Racial background can be associated with higher recidivism rates in the U.S., although this case involves only an arrest, not a conviction.\"),\n    (\"age and living situation\", \"low\", \"She is 19 years old, living alone, and has no family support or children, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"education and employment status\", \"medium\", \"With a high school diploma and attending college, she has some education but may lack the stability of higher education or full-time employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use and mental health\", \"low\", \"She has not used drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good personal health and emotional well-being.\"),\n    (\"family history (household size 5)\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five could present challenges but does not directly indicate a high risk of recidivism if she is now living independently.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"She considers God to be involved in her life, which may provide spiritual support and resilience against stressors that could lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
