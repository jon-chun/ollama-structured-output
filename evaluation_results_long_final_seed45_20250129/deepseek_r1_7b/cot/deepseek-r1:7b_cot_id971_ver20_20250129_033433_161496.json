    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine the rearrest recidivism risk for this individual using their provided information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's 21. Younger than average recidivists, so maybe lower risk here.\n\nRace: White. Generally, race doesn't directly impact risk scores in most systems, but it's something to note for broader understanding.\n\nConvictions: He has one. Previous convictions can increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and recently felt down. Drug use is a significant risk factor.\n\nMarital status: Single and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems which might reduce risk, but also could mean isolation.\n\nEducation: Only GED, which might indicate limited opportunities or previous unstable situations. Some college enrollment shows commitment but may not directly correlate with lower risk if focused on risky areas.\n\nEmployment: Employed one job last year. Employment generally reduces recidivism, so maybe a mitigating factor here.\n\nHousehold size and living conditions: Small household in urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates or social stressors that might increase risk.\n\nBelief in God: He doesn't see a divine connection to his life events. This could relate to mental health factors, which are sometimes linked to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and previous conviction stand out as high-risk factors. The age is on the lower end but still significant enough for consideration. The belief in God might not directly impact risk but could be a point of personal stress that affects behavior.\n\nSo, considering these points, I think he has a higher risk. The strong risk factors might outweigh any mitigating ones like his education or single living situation.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for this individual, here is the collective prediction:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young and may be associated with lower recidivism risk compared to older adults.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race does not directly impact risk scores in most systems, being White could be noted as a consideration for broader understanding of recidivistic patterns.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having one prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending, especially if it is for a serious offense.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy drug use, particularly marijuana, and feelings of low mood could be indicators of substance abuse issues that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and being single can provide some isolation but does not necessarily directly correlate with high risk without additional context about support networks.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"holding only a GED could indicate limited opportunities or previous unstable circumstances, which might be mitigated by current enrollment in college.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job last year; consistent employment is generally protective against recidivism but may not directly offset other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Conditions\", \"low\", \"Living in a small household within an urban area could have social or environmental stressors, but without specific context on associated risks.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God does not inherently predict recidivism but may be related to personal mental health factors that are sometimes linked to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
