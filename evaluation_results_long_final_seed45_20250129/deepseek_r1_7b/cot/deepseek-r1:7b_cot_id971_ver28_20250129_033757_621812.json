    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this person. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young. Young adults often have more potential for positive change, so that might be a low risk factor here.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism rates without more context. Generally, race can be a factor in sentencing and recidivism, but without specific data on this case, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe it's medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are a strong indicator of future behavior issues. So that should be high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so probably low impact.\n\n living alone could have some implications, but without knowing if he has support systems, it might not add much. Maybe medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can sometimes lead to better job opportunities and financial stability, which are positive factors for lower risk. So that's probably a low factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment can increase recidivism because it might affect his motivation to change behavior. That would be medium to high risk.\n\nUsing drugs in the past four years is concerning. Drug use can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior, so that's definitely a high factor.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety. These conditions can lead to substance abuse and increased recidivism rates, so another high factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area might suggest he was raised in an environment without strong family support, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors. That's medium-high.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life could mean he doesn't seek spiritual guidance or support, which might affect his decision-making and relationships, adding another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), recent drug use (high), unemployment (medium), living alone (low), GED in college (low), recent low mood (high), family background (high). So the overall risk is very high. The model I'm using gives a 75% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to impulsive or illegal actions.\"),\n    (\"Recent Low Mood\", \"high\", \"Emotional distress, such as low mood, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support but does not inherently increase risk without other factors like prior issues.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college can indicate some educational support and opportunities for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Employment status is variable; holding one job during the year may not be sufficient to prevent recidivism but also isn't a strong protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
