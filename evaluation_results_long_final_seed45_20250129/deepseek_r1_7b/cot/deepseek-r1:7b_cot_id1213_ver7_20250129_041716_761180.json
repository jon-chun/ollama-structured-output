    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history of one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad yet, but since it's an arrest and not a conviction, maybe her risk is lower compared to someone with a conviction. So that could be low or medium.\n\nHer age is 19, which is relatively young, so she's likely in the early stages of her career, making her more susceptible to making mistakes. That might bump it up a bit to medium.\n\nShe identifies as Black, and race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors like over-policing and biased sentencing. So that's probably a high risk factor because being Black can lead to harsher sentences or more monitoring, increasing chances of rearrest.\n\nShe is 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Her BMI isn't provided, but weight could play a role if she's underweight or overweight, which might affect her health or self-esteem. Without more info on that, maybe it's low.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014living situation can influence support systems. Being single might mean fewer resources and less stability, so perhaps medium risk here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education typically correlates with lower recidivism rates because of better job prospects. So this could be low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nOnly one job in the past year\u2014employment stability can affect recidivism. Having a job might show she's proactive, but if it's inconsistent, maybe medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the last month. These positive indicators should lower her risk. So that factor is probably low or very low.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That's a lot of kids, which might suggest she wasn't well cared for or had exposure to negative environments, increasing risk\u2014high or medium?\n\nHer spiritual belief in God could provide support and resilience, so that might be a mitigating factor\u2014low.\n\nPutting it all together: high due to race, moderate factors from living situation and family, low from education and good mental health. The arrest history is a point but not as significant without a conviction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history (1 arrest, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, which may indicate potential for recidivism despite not being convicted, suggesting medium risk.\"),\n    (\"age (19)\", \"low\", \"Age is relatively young, making her more susceptible to mistakes and thus lower risk.\"),\n    (\"race (Black)\", \"high\", \"Racial background can influence systemic factors leading to higher recidivism rates, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"height/weight (5'6\"/190 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No data on BMI; height alone does not strongly indicate risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"living situation (single, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support networks but does not inherently increase risk unless other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"education (high school diploma, in college)\", \"low\", \"Strong educational background correlates with lower recidivism rates, indicating low risk.\"),\n    (\" employment (1 job in past year)\", \"medium\", \"Single job shows some stability, but inconsistency could indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use/drug test (none in last four years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use history is a strong positive indicator of lower risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health (no depression in last month)\", \"low\", \"Positive mental health indicates good resilience and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"household size at young age (5, urban area)\", \"high\", \"Living with multiple siblings in an urban setting may indicate exposure to negative influences, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"spiritual belief in God\", \"low\", \"Religious belief can provide support and resilience, mitigating risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
