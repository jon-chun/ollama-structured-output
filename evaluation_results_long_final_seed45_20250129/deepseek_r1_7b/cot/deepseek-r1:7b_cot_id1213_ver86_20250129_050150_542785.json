Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it's not a conviction, it shows some interaction with the system. But since it's only one arrest and she's young, maybe the weight isn't too high yet.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Her height is average for her age, but her weight might be concerning. Being underweight can lead to health issues which could affect her re-arrest chances. So that factor should be high.\n\nNever married and living alone... Not a big risk unless there's a history of isolation leading to substance abuse or other issues. She also has a high school diploma and is in college, so she's likely stable education-wise. No job held recently\u2014jobless can sometimes mean she might not have the skills for current jobs.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression in the past month. That\u2019s positive; low risk of substance abuse or mental health issues which are big factors in recidivism.\n\nYoung age, lived with her mother in a household of five... That's an indicator of possible neglect or abuse, especially since she was very young. That should be high because that environment can lead to behavioral issues and higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHer religious belief\u2014doesn't directly relate to risk but might influence her behavior indirectly through community involvement or personal values, though it's less direct.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest isn't a conviction, so maybe low initially. Her weight is high, which could be medium. The living situation with five people in an urban area and past neglect\u2014high risk. Education and job status are positive but not directly mitigating the living situation.\n\nSo overall, she's at higher risk because of her living environment. Maybe 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Her single non-conviction arrest may suggest limited past complications, but it still indicates some interaction with the criminal system which can be a minor concern.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"Her weight could potentially lead to health issues that might affect her re-arrest risk, though not directly high.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living with her mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age is a significant risk factor due to possible neglect or abuse, which can increase recidivism chances.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \"She has a diploma and is in college, which could suggest stability but does not directly mitigate other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use/No Depression\", \"low\", \"Positive indicators for health and mental well-being reduce risk associated with substance abuse or mental illness issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
