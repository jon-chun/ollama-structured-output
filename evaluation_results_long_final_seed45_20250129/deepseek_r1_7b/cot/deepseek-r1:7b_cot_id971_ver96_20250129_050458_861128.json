    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. He's a 21-year-old male, White, with a criminal history\u2014only one arrest and a conviction. His physical attributes are average height and weight, but those probably aren't too relevant here.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which might mean he doesn't have the same support structure as someone who's married or in a group setting. He has a GED and is in college, so maybe he's motivated to change his situation. He only held one job recently, which could indicate some instability if that job was challenging.\n\nHe's used marijuana before but not recently\u2014maybe he's trying to be clean now. His mood this month is quite low sometimes, which might affect his motivation or ability to seek help. \n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That could have had both positive and negative influences\u2014he probably learned some life skills but also faced challenges from living in a crowded urban environment.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so maybe he's more self-reliant or doesn't seek religious guidance for support. This might influence his personal motivations towards changing his situation or seeking help.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a prior criminal history which is medium risk, but also factors like living alone (low), GED and college (medium positive), one job (neutral?), marijuana use (low to medium negative), and a troubled early life (high). His mood issues could be a red flag for substance abuse or lack of motivation. \n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence because while there are some high factors, he has support from education and is in college. But the past behavior points toward possible relapse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest with a conviction can increase risk of reoffending as individuals often repeat past behaviors or circumstances that led to previous convictions.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce factors like family support and community resources, which could slightly lower the risk compared to living with someone else but not eliminating it entirely.\"),\n    (\"Education & College\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college can indicate a desire for change and higher likelihood of entering positive behaviors or seeking help, thus medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job may provide some stability, though the nature of employment is neutral here, not directly indicating high or low risk but suggesting potential supportiveness through work opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past and recent use could indicate occasional substance abuse; however, it's a minor use compared to more serious drug dependencies which would be higher risk factors if present regularly.
