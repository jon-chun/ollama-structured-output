    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. I remember that in some studies, even non-convicted arrests can be considered as recidivism because they're still past convictions. So maybe that counts as a medium risk since there's a chance her prior offense could influence future behavior.\n\nHer age is 19, which isn't too old yet, but she might have more time to develop habits or skills. Being in high school and attending college shows some commitment, which could be a positive factor. Maybe it lowers the risk compared to someone not in education.\n\nShe's living alone, so no one else to look out for her. I wonder if living with family gives a sense of security that might be missing here. No drugs use in four years is good; substance abuse can definitely contribute to recidivism. Her mental health seems fine since she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is another positive.\n\nShe had a household size of five at a young age when she lived with her mom. Larger households sometimes provide more support and stability, so maybe that's a mitigating factor here. But the fact that she's now living alone might mean she's lost some of that support structure.\n\nHer religious affiliation could offer guidance or purpose, which might help in reducing recidivism. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a clean record, education, no drug use, and good mental health. The only negative point is living alone after being in a big household as a child. The non-convicted arrest might be a medium risk since it's still an offense but not a conviction yet. \n\nI think the risk factors lean towards low or medium. Maybe overall prediction is low risk because of her positive traits, but I'm not entirely sure how much weight each factor carries.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis considers various risk factors and their potential influence on rearrest recidivism:\n\n- **Non-Convicted Arrest**: Medium risk due to the nature of past offense potentially influencing future behavior despite not being a conviction.\n- **Age and Education**: Positive factors indicating possible positive influences, contributing to lower risk.\n- **Living Alone**: Possible negative factor affecting security but balanced by other mitigating factors like education.\n- **Clean Substance Use and Mental Health**: Strong positive indicators reducing recidivism risk.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n1. Non-Convicted Arrest - Medium - The past offense could influence behavior, indicating medium risk despite not being a conviction.\n2. Clean Substance Use - High - No drug use in four years is a significant mitigating factor.\n3. Positive Mental Health - High - Recent lack of depression suggests good mental health contributing to lower risk.\n\n**Prediction:**\nThe individual appears to be at low risk for rearrest recidivism due to positive factors like education, clean habits, and mental well-being, despite the non-convicted arrest.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Non-Convicted Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The past offense could influence behavior, indicating medium risk despite not being a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Clean Substance Use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in four years is a significant mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Positive Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Recent lack of depression suggests good mental health contributing to lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
