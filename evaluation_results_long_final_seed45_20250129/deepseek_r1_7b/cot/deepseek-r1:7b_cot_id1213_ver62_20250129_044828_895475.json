    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female rearrest within three years. She's Black, which might have some implications based on racial profiling in criminal justice. She's been arrested once but not convicted, so maybe that's a red flag because it could lead to more serious charges if she gets busted again.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out about her weight concerning crime. She's living alone, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates, possibly due to isolation or lack of support network. She has a high school diploma but is in college, so maybe she's seeking better opportunities.\n\nShe hasn't been married and doesn't feel depressed recently. That could be a positive sign as not feeling depressed might indicate good mental health, which can influence her decision-making when faced with criminal justice issues.\n\nHer past living situation: at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's quite crowded and could have had some stressors or influences that might affect her now. Urban environments sometimes have different dynamics compared to rural areas, which can impact community ties and opportunities.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. That religious belief might provide some stability but could also be a risk factor if it leads to decision-making influenced by religion rather than practical considerations.\n\nPutting this all together: The single prior arrest is a moderate risk because not being convicted means she's likely avoiding severe penalties, but the living situation at home and her age make me think she's in a family environment that might influence her. Her lack of depression suggests good mental health, which is positive for recidivism rates.\n\nConsidering everything, I'm leaning towards a medium relative weight overall because while there are some risk factors like her prior arrest and family background, the positive aspects like her education and mental well-being balance it out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Her single prior arrest, though not convicted, could potentially lead to more serious charges if re-arrested.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may correlate with higher recidivism rates due to isolation and lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being in college suggests she is seeking better opportunities which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed for the past month could indicate good mental health, reducing risk factors associated with mental instability.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area may have had stressors that could influence her behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God and considering His influence on personal events provides some stability, which can mitigate risk factors associated with spiritual influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
