    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment step by step. The person is a 21-year-old male with several factors that could influence his recidivism.\n\nFirst, he has a history of arrest and conviction. That's a strong red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. So, that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which might suggest some level of education but also indicates he's still active and maybe looking to improve his situation. Education can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, so this might be a medium factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support system, which isn't ideal for someone re-entering society, potentially increasing risk. That's another high factor.\n\nDrug use history is concerning. Even if he hasn't used recently, past use can have long-term effects and might affect his ability to form stable relationships or jobs. High risk again.\n\nHis recent emotional low could indicate deeper issues that might affect his stability. This could be a medium-high factor since it's relevant but maybe not as direct as other factors.\n\nGrowing up in a household of three with no religious support might leave him more vulnerable. That's definitely high because environments without strong support can lead to higher recidivism rates.\n\nConsidering all these, the overall risk seems pretty high. He has multiple factors pointing towards a likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"holding a GED and currently enrolled in college may indicate some level of stability but also shows that he is still actively pursuing better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking help from inappropriate sources.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \" past use of marijuana and recent feelings of low mood may indicate potential substance abuse issues that could impact his ability to function or form positive relationships.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of three without religious involvement may create a lack of support system, increasing vulnerability to negative influences and recidivism risks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
