    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's Black but hasn't been convicted yet, which might affect her recidivism rate compared to others of similar background who have been convicted. I think having a criminal history increases risk, so since hers is still pending, that's low.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight can sometimes be associated with health issues like hypertension or diabetes, which might affect recidivism indirectly through health problems. But it doesn't directly indicate higher risk of reoffending. So maybe medium.\n\nLiving alone is a point to consider. Some studies suggest that living with family reduces stress and strain, potentially lowering the risk of reoffending compared to living independently. So this factor would be low.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college shows she's educated. Education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates because it provides better opportunities and skills. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which is okay but not necessarily bad. Having some employment can help with stability and reduce the urge to commit crimes for food or other basic needs. Maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in past four years suggests she's clean, which aligns with good behavior patterns. Clean individuals often have lower recidivism rates. So that's low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month indicates she's mentally stable and less likely to engage in self-harming or dangerous behaviors. That would be a strong negative factor, so high.\n\nHer young age of 19 is another point. Young adults might make impulsive decisions without considering long-term consequences. However, it's also possible that she has had little life experience leading to higher risk if she hasn't faced any challenges yet. So maybe medium.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area could indicate family stress or neglect, which can increase recidivism chances. This is a high risk factor because family dynamics and environment are significant predictors.\n\nHer belief in God might suggest strong moral support and commitment to values that prevent criminal behavior. That's a protective factor, so low.\n\nPutting it all together: high school education and no drugs are positive signs; living with her mom suggests a supportive environment but maybe past neglect could still be there. Her young age is mixed because she hasn't had many life experiences yet. The belief in God helps mitigate some negative factors like family issues. So the overall risk might be low to medium.\n\nI'm leaning towards a 3-year prediction of low risk, with confidence around 60-70% since not all factors are perfect but several mitigating points exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has not been convicted yet\", \"low\", \"Since she has only one arrest and is Black, it indicates a lower recidivism rate compared to others with similar backgrounds who have been convicted.\"),\n    (\"Medium weight\", \"medium\", \"Her body weight of 190 lbs may be associated with certain health issues which could indirectly affect her reoffending rate but doesn't directly point to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with family can reduce stress and strain, potentially lowering the risk of reoffending compared to living independently.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"low\", \"Education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates as it provides better opportunities and skills which can help avoid criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"One job held during the year\", \"medium\", \"Having some employment can provide stability but one job may not be sufficient to ensure long-term stability or prevent reoffending for basic needs.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Lack of drug use suggests good behavior patterns and lower likelihood of engaging in dangerous activities which could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Not feeling depressed over past month\", \"high\", \"Mental well-being is crucial.
