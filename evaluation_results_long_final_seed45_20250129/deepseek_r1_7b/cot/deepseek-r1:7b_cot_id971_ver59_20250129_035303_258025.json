    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old male with various factors contributing to his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. Generally, there aren't significant racial disparities in recidivism in many studies, but this person has only one arrest and conviction, so maybe not a strong factor here.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which might indicate some level of education that could help him in getting better job opportunities or support, possibly lowering his risk. However, his recent use of marijuana could be affecting his mental state, which might influence his ability to make positive changes.\n\nAt 21, he's still relatively young, so maybe he has the capacity for change and support systems. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, but if he's attending college and has a job, that's mitigating some risk factors.\n\nHis past living situation with his mother in a household of three might have shaped his behavior; perhaps it was chaotic or he learned responsibility from there. His belief in God not influencing his personal events could mean he doesn't seek spiritual guidance for issues, but that's more about support systems than the risk itself.\n\nHe feels down and has used drugs recently. This emotional state can impair judgment and ability to take proactive steps, which might increase rearrest chances.\n\nConsidering all these factors: low-level education, recent drug use, living alone, personal circumstances... I think his overall risk is medium.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor related to the individual's background and circumstances, here's a structured analysis leading to the final prediction:\n\n**Risk Factors Analysis:**\n\n1. **Race (White):** Generally, there are no significant racial disparities in recidivism rates that would notably influence this individual's risk assessment.\n\n2. **Education Level:** The individual holds a GED and is enrolled in college, which suggests potential for better opportunities and support systems, potentially mitigating rearrest risks.\n\n3. **Drug Use:** Recent marijuana use could impair judgment and motivation, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\n\n4. **Living Situation:** Living alone at 21 might contribute to isolation but is offset by active involvement in college and employment, which can provide stability and support networks.\n\n5. **Emotional State:** Recent feelings of low mood could affect decision-making and engagement with necessary resources or interventions.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nGiven the factors considered, particularly the recent drug use and potential emotional state impacting his ability to engage constructively, I predict a **YES** for rearrest within three years. However, the presence of education and active involvement in college suggests that this risk is not as high as it could be. Therefore, my confidence level is set at 65%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"low\", \"There is no significant racial disparity in recidivism rates that would notably influence this individual's risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"The individual holds a GED and is enrolled in college, which suggests potential for better opportunities and support systems, potentially mitigating rearrest risks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could impair judgment and motivation, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 21 might contribute to isolation but is offset by active involvement in college and employment, which can provide stability and support networks.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood could affect decision-making and engagement with necessary resources or interventions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
