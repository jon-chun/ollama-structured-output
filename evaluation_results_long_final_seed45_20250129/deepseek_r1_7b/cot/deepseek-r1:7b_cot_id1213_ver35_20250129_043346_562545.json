    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment. So, the person is a 19-year-old female from Black background, arrested once but not convicted. She's white in height and weight, living alone with no kids, has a high school diploma plus college, one job, hasn't used drugs in four years, no depression in the past month.\n\nShe grew up in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area, and she believes in God affecting her life. \n\nFirst, age: 19 is quite young; younger adults often have fewer life experiences and may be less stable. That might lower the risk but not drastically since she's making efforts now.\n\nRace: Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but it's a sensitive area. Since she\u2019s not convicted yet, maybe it doesn't heavily impact her risk as much as someone who has been convicted.\n\nMarital status and living alone: No kids, so less dependency which is good. She's not in a committed relationship either (since she's single), reducing family support potentially.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma plus college suggests some stability but maybe not enough for career advancement or substance abuse prevention.\n\nOccupation-wise, holding one job could be a positive as steady income might help with financial independence and reduce the need to turn to criminal activities. Not using drugs in four years is a strong indicator of self-control.\n\nNo depression: Positive sign; may indicate better mental health which can deter recidivism.\n\nUpbringing: Growing up in an urban area among five siblings could have its challenges, like family dynamics or stressors, but she's now living alone with support from God. Maybe her spiritual aspect helps mitigate some issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are mixed but lean towards lower risk. No major red flags except maybe her past arrest and race considerations. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, that factor is lessened. So overall prediction would be low to no risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals may have fewer life experiences and could be less stable, which might lower the risk of recidivism but does not guarantee it.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Criminal justice disparities can influence risk assessment; however, since she has not been convicted yet, its impact is mitigated.\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no children suggests reduced dependency on family support, which may lower recidivism risk.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college indicates some stability; however, ongoing education can help reduce future risks.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Occupation\", \"low\", \"Holding one job suggests financial independence, which can deter substance abuse or illegal activities.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs in the past four years is a positive indicator of self-control and adherence to laws.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression for the past month indicates good mental health, which can reduce stress and encourage responsible behavior.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with five siblings could present challenges, but her current living situation alone suggests reduced family influence.\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"high\", \"Considering that God has something to do with her personal life may provide guidance and reduce stress, which can lower recidivism risk.\", \"high\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
