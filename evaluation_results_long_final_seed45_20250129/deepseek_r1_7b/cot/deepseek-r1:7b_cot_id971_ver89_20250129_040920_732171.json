    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a request from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 21-year-old male and asked for a relative weight assigned to each risk factor before predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the query thoroughly. The person is White, age 21, with one prior arrest and conviction. His height and weight are given, but I don't think those factors are significant here since he's young. He's living alone, never married, has a GED, enrolled in college, only held one job, used marijuana in the past four years, felt down recently.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area and doesn't believe in God affecting his life. These factors could be relevant to understanding his background and possible behavior.\n\nI need to break down each factor's potential impact on recidivism. For example, using marijuana might indicate substance abuse issues which can contribute to recidivism. His living situation with three people might suggest a stable environment but could also have its drawbacks.\n\nSince he has no prior criminal history except for one arrest, that's a low risk initially. However, factors like drug use and recent emotional distress could increase it. The fact that he used marijuana in the past four years but not recently might mean he's less likely to continue using now.\n\nHis current job situation is stable since he only has one job, which might suggest reliability but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there's instability elsewhere.\n\nHe isn't married and living alone, which could be a risk factor for substance abuse or neglect if issues arise. His GED may put him at a disadvantage in getting traditional employment but he's attending college now, which is positive.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I need to weigh each one. The use of marijuana might have the highest weight as it directly relates to substance abuse, which can lead to other criminal behaviors. Other factors like living situation and recent emotional distress are also significant but perhaps lower in impact compared to drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has prior arrest/crim conviction\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one prior arrest and conviction, which is a relatively low recidivism risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can be associated with increased recidivism risk due to potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase recidivism risk unless there are other factors such as neglect or domestic issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (held 1 job during the year)\", \"low\", \"Holding one job for a year is a stable employment history, which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Recent emotional distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and emotionally distressed can be a sign of potential substance abuse or mental health issues, both of which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years is a significant factor that could indicate ongoing substance abuse behavior, which is strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother in household of size 3 in urban area\", \"low\", \"No evidence suggests this living arrangement has led to issues such as neglect or domestic violence, so it does not significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God (no impact on personal life)\", \"low\", \"A lack of belief in God is not a significant factor in predicting recidivism and should not be considered a risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
