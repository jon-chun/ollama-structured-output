    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history of one arrest but no conviction. That might be considered low risk because she hasn't actually been convicted of any crime. But maybe the fact that she's been arrested could still indicate some underlying issues or stressors.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs at 5'6\". That\u2019s on the higher end, so weight concerns might factor in. She\u2019s living alone and isn\u2019t married, which could contribute to isolation issues. Maybe she feels disconnected from others, increasing her risk of substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma with college enrollment. College attendance is generally positive because it shows commitment and self-improvement. Being enrolled might suggest she's motivated to change her situation.\n\nShe\u2019s employed one job in the past year. Employment usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides stability and financial independence. One job isn't great, but it's better than none.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of low risk. Substance abuse can be a major driver of recidivism if present, but since she hasn\u2019t used drugs, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t felt depressed over the past month, which is another positive factor. Depression can lead to substance abuse or self-harm, so not feeling it might reduce her risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Large households can be isolating and stressful, potentially leading to behavioral issues that could reoccur later in life.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This belief might reduce stressors related to lack of support or facing tough times, which can lower her risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Low criminal history, positive education and employment, no drug use, and no depression contribute to low risk. However, the family environment is concerning because she\u2019s in a large household with her biological mother. That could indicate past instability, which might affect her ability to form strong support systems now, possibly increasing risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium risk because while there are some positive factors, the family history isn't ideal and could present hidden issues that contribute to recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which might indicate prior stressors or underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"single_and_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and not married could lead to isolation, potentially increasing risk factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight may be a concern, but without specific health issues, it doesn't directly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest stability and self-improvement, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of low risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, further reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a large household could indicate past instability, which might affect future support systems and recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
