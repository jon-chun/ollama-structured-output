    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which isn't that old yet. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing socially and maybe not fully understanding right from wrong. So this could be a medium factor.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race plays a direct role in recidivism unless there are systemic issues or bias present elsewhere. Since the question doesn't mention any such factors, I'll consider this as low risk because it's an insensitive factor without given context.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's definitely concerning. A prior conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to reoffending. So this should be a high factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here unless they relate to health issues, which aren't mentioned. So I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Being single might not directly correlate with crime, but it could indicate he doesn't have the support system needed for reintegration after prison. However, without specific info on how living situation affects recidivism, this is a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can positively influence behavior if properly used, but it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there's a lack of support. Since he's actively studying, I'll consider this as low risk because education usually helps reduce recidivism rates.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability is important; frequent unemployment can lead to higher recidivism. One job might not be enough for long-term stability, so this could be a medium factor.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. Some recent drug use, especially if it's recent, might indicate altered thinking or increased risk of impulsive behavior. However, since it's only marijuana and not other substances, I'll consider this as low to medium because drug use can be a risk factor depending on the context.\n\nHis current mood state: He feels down most of the time and hasn't felt anything to cheer him up recently. This could indicate depression or stress, which might affect his decision-making or willingness to engage in positive activities, potentially increasing recidivism risk. So this is medium.\n\nHe was a minor when he lived with his mother in a household of three in an urban area. If he's a minor now, that might not directly relate unless there were behavioral issues during that time. Without specific info, I'll consider it as low because being raised in such a setting doesn't inherently correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life could influence his motivation for positive behavior or attending school and work. If he's not religious, maybe he's more focused on secular goals which might help reduce recidivism risk. But if he's feeling disconnected from any support system, it could be a problem. Since there's no info on this, I'll rate it as low.\n\nPutting all these factors together: High due to prior arrest, medium due to jobless and possible drug use affecting his mental state, and other factors being lower. So overall, the risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals may have higher recidivism rates as they are still developing socially and may not fully understand right from wrong.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"The person's race does not directly influence recidivism unless there are systemic issues or biases present, which is not mentioned here.\"),\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending due to past behavior and related factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system for reintegration after prison but does not directly correlate with crime without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Education and College\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college can positively influence behavior, reducing recidivism risks as indicated by active studies.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year may lead to frequent unemployment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates for those without stable employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years indicates possible altered thinking or impulsive behavior but is limited to marijuana and recent use does not necessarily correlate strongly with high risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood State\", \"medium\", \"Sustained low mood may affect decision-making and willingness to engage positively, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of three as a minor without specific behavioral issues during that time does not inherently correlate with higher recidivism risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may influence motivation towards positive behavior, but the lack of involvement suggests it might not be a significant factor in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
