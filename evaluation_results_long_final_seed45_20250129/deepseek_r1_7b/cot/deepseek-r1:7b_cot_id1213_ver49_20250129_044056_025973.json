    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 19-year-old female with a high school diploma and living alone rearissing within three years. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, her age is 19; recidivism tends to decrease as people get older once they're out of prison. So that's not a strong risk factor here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't employed in gainful ways. Maybe she's struggling with job stability or low income, which could contribute. But since it's just one job held recently and she hasn't used drugs, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nLiving alone\u2014being single can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism due to isolation, but at 19, she might be attending college, so that stabilizes things a bit.\n\nNo prior convictions or arrests; she's only been arrested once. That's a good sign\u2014it suggests she hasn't had significant legal issues before, which might indicate lower risk of reoffending.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression\u2014these are positive factors showing stability in her behavior.\n\nShe was living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This could be concerning because family dynamics can influence recidivism. Younger siblings present might have different support structures, potentially leading to higher risk if there's tension or instability.\n\nHer religious belief adds another layer\u2014sometimes religion provides guidance and support, which might help maintain stability. However, living with five people in an urban area could introduce stressors she isn't managing well.\n\nConsidering all these, the factors pointing towards low risk due to her education, stable living situation (college), and positive behavior. The potential family dynamics in the household of five are a slight concern but maybe manageable if she's handling it well. Given that she doesn't have any recent drug use or depression, I'm leaning towards low risk.\n\nSo overall prediction is low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nThe factors considered indicate a low risk for recidivism due to her education level, stable living situation, and positive behavior patterns. The household dynamics in the past may pose minor concerns but are manageable if she maintains stability. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19; recidivism tends to decrease as people get older once they're out of prison.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma but isn't employed in gainful ways, which could impact her stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 19 might be challenging, especially if she's attending college, which can provide some support.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"low\", \"She has no prior convictions or arrests but was arrested once; this suggests she hasn't had significant legal issues before.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression indicate positive behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five could introduce stressors that may impact her stability if not managed well.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
