    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but I don't think that directly affects his risk unless there's some systemic bias, which is probably not applicable here since we're looking at individual factors.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction. That immediately raises the risk because past convictions are strong indicators of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight aren't relevant here; they don't provide any useful information about his behavior or circumstances.\n\nNever married living alone \u2013 while living arrangements can sometimes correlate with substance use, I don't see a direct link without more context. So maybe this is medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which might indicate good education, possibly leading to better job opportunities or stable living situations. That could lower the risk slightly.\n\nOnly held one job recently \u2013 having recent employment suggests he's been actively seeking work, which can contribute to stability and reduce recidivism.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana before but not recently. However, past drug use is a concern because it might indicate ongoing substance abuse issues or triggers that could affect his mental state.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's concerning because family instability can lead to emotional and behavioral issues later on.\n\nBelieving God has nothing to do with his life \u2013 this might suggest a lack of spiritual support, which could be associated with higher recidivism rates as people sometimes turn to other sources for help or guidance when religion isn't there.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and convictions are the strongest indicators. The drug use is a moderate risk factor. Family issues and belief in an outside force might add some additional risk without being as significant as the previous factors. So overall, his risk seems high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which is strongly associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years adds to the risk, though not as directly linked as prior arrests.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
