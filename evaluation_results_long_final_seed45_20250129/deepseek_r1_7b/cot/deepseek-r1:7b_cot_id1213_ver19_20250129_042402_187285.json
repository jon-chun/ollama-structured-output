    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black but hasn't been convicted yet. I know racial factors can influence arrest rates, so not being convicted might play a role here. But since she's only been arrested once without a conviction, maybe her risk isn't too high from that angle.\n\nHer age is 19, which means she has about three more years before she turns 20. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing skills and life experiences. So that might be a medium factor contributing to her risk.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight can sometimes affect how people interact with the system, but without more info on body type or past behavior related to weight, I shouldn't assign much here\u2014probably low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone might mean she has fewer social supports. Social support is important because it can help reduce stress and provide resources if things go wrong. So maybe a medium effect from living alone.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment: education usually reduces recidivism. Being in college could indicate responsible behavior or higher likelihood of future success, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nOnly one job in the past year\u2014maybe she's still finding her way or perhaps has unstable employment. Unstable jobs can lead to stress, which might increase recidivism if it leads to substance abuse or other issues. So maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression\u2014this is a positive sign. Clean records and mental health support are good indicators of lower risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area since a young age. Large households can sometimes create more stress, especially if people feel isolated or neglected. This might be a medium factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nConsidering God's influence on her life\u2014religion often provides support and structure. If she feels connected and supported by religion, that could mitigate some negative factors, making this maybe low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: not convicted but arrested once (medium), young age (medium), living alone (medium), no substance use (low), education (low). The other factors like household size are a bit conflicting because larger households can be stressful. \n\nI think the dominant risk here is her youth and being Black, combined with living alone without strong support. So I'd lean towards medium risk but perhaps slightly higher due to the age factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black background\", \"medium\", \"Racial background can influence arrest rates which may indirectly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age of 19\", \"medium\", \"Young adults often have higher recidivism rates due to developing life skills and experiences.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone reduces social support, potentially increasing stress and negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Clean substance use history is a positive indicator of lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (no depression)\", \"low\", \"Positive mental health contributes to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education (high school diploma, college enrollment)\", \"low\", \"Higher education and ongoing education indicate future responsibility and success.\"),\n    (\"Employment (one job in past year)\", \"medium\", \"Unstable or limited employment can lead to stress which may contribute to negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Household of size 5\", \"medium\", \"Large households can create stress, especially if people feel neglected or isolated.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
