    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. The recidivism rate is higher for Black individuals compared to White, but age and other factors might mitigate that here since she's only 19 with a high school diploma.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction, so maybe it won't significantly impact her risk. Only one arrest isn't too bad, especially if it was minor or recent.\n\nAge-wise, being 19 is low on the risk scale because younger people often have more potential for positive changes and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe if they were part of a larger dataset, but in this case, they're just factual info without impact.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates. Some solitary living can be associated with substance abuse issues, but she's not using drugs now and hasn't felt depressed recently, so that might balance it out.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job opportunities and support systems later on. Plus, she's only one job, which isn't too bad for someone at her stage.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Drug abuse is a known risk factor for reoffending, but she's clean here.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests she's mentally stable, which is good news.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That might indicate some stress or family issues, but she's considered God as a significant influence, so maybe she has strong support and motivation to change.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like living situation could be negatives, but her education, lack of drug use, mental stability, and being Black with age might balance that out. So her risk is probably low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals typically have lower recidivism rates due to greater potential for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use indicates reduced risk of substance abuse-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"Educational attainment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest better job opportunities and support networks which may reduce recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year might not be a significant barrier for re-employment with support systems in place.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggests stable mental state, but mental health can fluctuate and may influence behavior over time.\"),\n    (\"Family History/Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk; however, past family dynamics could indicate potential challenges that might be mitigated by current support systems.\"),\n    (\"Reputational Risk (Black female)\", \"low\", \"While there are inherent disparities in recidivism rates based on race and gender, this individual's age, education, and stable living situation suggest a lower risk compared to the general population.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
