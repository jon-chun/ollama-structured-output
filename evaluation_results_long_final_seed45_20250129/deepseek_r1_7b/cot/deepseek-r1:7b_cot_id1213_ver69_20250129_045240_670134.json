    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black but hasn't been convicted yet. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since she's not convicted, maybe that doesn't heavily impact her risk right now. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually means better job prospects. High education often correlates with lower recidivism because people with higher education tend to have better skills and are more likely to find stable jobs or support themselves.\n\nShe lives alone, which might limit her social support network. While living alone doesn't necessarily increase risk on its own, it could mean less help in times of trouble. But she's 19, so maybe her independence is still developing.\n\nHer job situation: only one job during the year. That seems manageable, but having a steady income and benefits can reduce recidivism. One job might be enough to support herself, especially if she's attending college.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use can lead to more risky situations or substance abuse issues, which can affect her ability to reintegrate into society successfully. So no drug use is a positive factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health isn't an issue here. It might have been a cause of prior issues, but since it's resolved, that's good news.\n\nAt 19 and living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher stress levels and more social factors that could influence behavior. A large family might mean she has siblings who could offer support or be sources of stress, but again, it's not directly linked to recidivism unless there are specific issues within the family.\n\nHer religious beliefs make her feel connected to something greater. This might provide a sense of purpose and stability, which can lower risk compared to someone without such anchor.\n\nConsidering all these factors: no convictions, education level, single living situation with a job, no drug use, mental health in check, family background, and positive religious involvement. These seem like protective factors that would lower her risk of rearrest.\n\nSo putting it all together, she's at low risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No prior convictions\", \"low\", \"She has not been convicted of any crimes despite being arrested once.
