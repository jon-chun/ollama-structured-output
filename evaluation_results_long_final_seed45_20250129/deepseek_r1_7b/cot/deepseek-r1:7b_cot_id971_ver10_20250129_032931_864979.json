    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 21-year-old male based on the provided information. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but still in the prime of his life. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, so that's definitely a red flag. The GED and college enrollment might suggest some motivation or lack thereof, but he's also only held one job, which could indicate past instability.\n\nHe uses drugs occasionally, specifically marijuana, which can have negative consequences on his behavior and mental health. His recent feelings of low mood might contribute to substance use issues. The fact that he feels down often is a behavioral sign, possibly indicating other stressors or underlying issues.\n\nLiving alone and never married might mean he doesn't have support systems, which could lead to increased stress and substance abuse. His past living situation with his biological mother in an urban area three years ago adds some instability but not as severe as a longer-term issue.\n\nHis lack of religious involvement suggests he might turn to other outlets for copeing, possibly leading to substance use or seeking help from others, which could influence recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest history is high risk. His drug use and mood issues are moderate contributors. The living situation and lack of support are medium factors. So overall, his risk seems high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior criminal conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood can contribute to substance abuse issues, which are risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"medium\", \"Frequent feelings of sadness may indicate underlying mental health concerns that could lead to further substance use or risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse suggests limited support networks, but the frequency and duration should be considered in assessing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and attending college shows some educational pursuit, which might indicate a desire to change, reducing immediate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job for a year may suggest past instability but doesn't directly correlate with high recidivism risk without other factors like substance use or mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
