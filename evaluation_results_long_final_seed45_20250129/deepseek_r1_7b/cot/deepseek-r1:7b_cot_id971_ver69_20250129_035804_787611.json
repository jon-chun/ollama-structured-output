    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but race doesn't directly impact recidivism here unless there are systemic issues, which aren't indicated in the data provided. So maybe that's a low factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which usually shows good education, so that might be a low risk factor since education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nHis past one arrest and one conviction: that's just his history. One offense isn't too bad on its own but combined with other factors could influence the prediction.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. No direct info here, so maybe it's low risk unless there are health issues involved, which we don't know about.\n\nLiving alone: living situation can affect support systems. Living alone might mean less supervision or help when he needs it, but again, not directly linked to high risk without other factors.\n\nNo marriage and no children mentioned, so that's a neutral factor on its own.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana is present (once in the past four years), which could indicate occasional substance use. Some recent negative mood might relate to drug use as sometimes substance abuse can affect mental health, but it's not a strong indicator of recidivism unless there's a pattern.\n\nPast living situation was with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's a family background which doesn't directly point towards high risk unless there were issues there, but nothing suggests that here.\n\nHis belief in God: If he thinks God has no role in his life, that might suggest some level of self-reliance or perhaps increased risk-taking behavior, but it's not a direct risk factor. Maybe slightly medium because lack of religious support could influence decision-making towards higher risk.\n\nHe was only employed one job during the year, so that shows he tried to find work but maybe didn't have consistent employment history, which is a bit low risk since having some job is better than nothing.\n\nPutting it all together: The main factors here are the arrest and the drug use. While he has education and support living alone, the past behavior might suggest some instability or substance issues that could lead to higher recidivism. The single job doesn't help much either. His belief in God is a bit on the medium side but not enough to tip it high.\n\nSo overall, I think there's a slight medium risk because of his drug use and living situation alone, but other factors like education and past stable employment might lower that. So maybe 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor, here is the structured evaluation:\n\n- **Drug Use History**: Medium - The presence of marijuana use in the past four years suggests occasional substance abuse, which can influence recidivism risk.\n- **Living Alone**: Low - Living independently may offer some protective factors but doesn't inherently increase risk without other negative indicators.\n\nConsidering these points and moderate weight from other factors like education and stable employment, the prediction leans towards a slightly medium risk with 50% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"The presence of marijuana use in the past four years suggests occasional substance abuse, which can influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently may offer some protective factors but doesn't inherently increase risk without other negative indicators.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
