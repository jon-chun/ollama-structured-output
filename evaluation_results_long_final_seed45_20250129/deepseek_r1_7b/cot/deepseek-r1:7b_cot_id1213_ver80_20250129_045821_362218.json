    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. She's been arrested once but not convicted, which might be a red flag because despite being charged, she hasn't gone to jail or gotten a plea deal. That could mean she doesn't see the consequences of her actions, so maybe she'll come back.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight can sometimes influence recidivism rates, but since she's in college, I'm not sure if that affects it directly. Maybe her education level plays a bigger role.\n\nShe's living alone without a spouse, so no one to look out for her. That could mean she might not get support when times are tough, which is concerning because having someone can provide emotional or practical help during rough patches.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually have good job prospects. Having a job gives her some stability rather than being unemployed, which I know increases recidivism rates.\n\nNot using drugs for four years and not feeling depressed recently is positive. Substance abuse often leads to more serious crimes or reoffending after release. Similarly, lack of recent depression might indicate better mental health, though it's not a complete picture.\n\nShe grew up in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area. That could mean she was raised in an environment that might have different stressors compared to smaller households. Urban settings can sometimes offer more opportunities but also more challenges.\n\nHer religious belief about God influencing her life is interesting. It might provide some moral guidance and stability, which could positively impact her behavior over time.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a negative history of arrest without conviction, living alone, and a potential lack of support system. Her positive factors like education, employment, substance abuse history, and religious beliefs are there but aren't as strong as the negatives. The urban environment might not be ideal for her stability.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because she has some solid positive factors that could help deter recidivism. But considering the negative past and lack of support, it's a close call. Maybe I'd give her a medium risk with a lower confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Arrests (Not Convicted)\", \"low\", \"The individual has one previous arrest but has not been convicted.
