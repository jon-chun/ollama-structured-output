    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help this user who is a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They're asking me to assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor provided for a specific individual and then predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism with a prediction (YES or NO) and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context properly. The user is presenting data about a 19-year-old female Black individual who has been arrested once but not convicted. She's living alone, has a high school diploma in college for two years, worked one job, no drug use in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived with her biological mother in a household of five since she was young, and believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nI should break down each factor provided by the user into their respective risk categories. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a minor offense, so I think this would be low risk because the impact hasn't been significant yet. Maybe the uncertainty of a conviction could affect her ability to commit again in the future.\n\n2. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma and is in college for two years. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this should be low risk.\n\n3. **Employment**: She's currently employed part-time or full-time? The user says she's enrolled in a 2-year college but hasn't specified her current job status beyond holding one job during the year. Employed individuals often have better support systems and higher chances of success, so this should be low risk.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: She hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a strong mitigating factor; not using drugs at all for that duration suggests lower risk of future drug-related offenses.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which indicates good mental health. This is another positive factor, suggesting she's less likely to experience mental health issues leading to recidivism.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: She's living alone at 19 years old in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of five. Being in such a large household could provide more support and stability, which usually lowers risk. However, being in the care of her biological mother might have some implications if there are any behavioral issues or neglect concerns.\n\n7. **Past Trauma**: She lived with her biological mother from a young age in an urban area. This is a significant factor because trauma can lead to various behavioral and mental health issues that increase recidivism risk. The context here suggests she's been in a supportive environment but could still have underlying issues affecting her behavior.\n\n8. **Belief in God**: Her belief in God might influence her decision-making, stress management, or moral choices. However, it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior unless there are other factors at play. This is probably low risk as it's an internal factor rather than external risk indicators like living conditions or family issues.\n\nNow, considering each of these points, I'll assign a weight:\n\n- **Arrest Record**: Low because one non-convicted arrest doesn't have significant consequences.\n- **Employment**: Low because employment supports stability and future opportunities.\n- **Drug Use**: Low because no recent drug use is a strong mitigant.\n- **Mental Health**: Low as she's not experiencing depression, indicating good mental health.\n- **Living Situation**: Medium because while living with her mother can be supportive, the household size of five might indicate potential issues that could contribute to risk if there are behavioral problems or neglect.\n\nThe belief in God and past trauma (from living with her mother) don't add significant risk factors here. On the other hand, she's young, has a high school diploma, is employed, and hasn't used drugs recently, all of which are positive indicators.\n\nPutting it all together, I think her overall risk for rearrest in three years is low to medium. However, considering that she's 19, still quite young, but with several mitigating factors like education, employment, no drug use, and good mental health, the confidence is high that she won't reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted.
