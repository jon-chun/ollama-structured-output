    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor for this 21-year-old male and predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, there's some evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but at 21, he's still considered young. Maybe this isn't a huge factor yet, so perhaps low risk.\n\nHe has one arrest and a conviction. One offense might not be too bad, especially if it's minor or recent. So medium risk here.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight alone probably doesn't predict much, but combined with his other stats like GED and college enrollment, maybe low weight for this factor.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014single men might have different behaviors compared to married individuals. Maybe no kids could mean less supervision, so medium risk here.\n\nGED certificate is a positive\u2014it shows some education. College enrollment too. These usually lower recidivism, so low risk.\n\nOnly held one job in the past year. Job stability can affect reoffending rates; fewer jobs might increase risk slightly\u2014maybe low to medium.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana and felt down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of possible substance abuse issues, which can lead to more risky behavior or higher recidivism\u2014high risk here.\n\nYoung age (21) living with three siblings in an urban area. Younger offenders might have different needs but could also be influenced by environment. Maybe medium risk because he's relatively young and had a multi-person household, possibly some support.\n\nDoesn't believe in God\u2014I'm not sure how this affects his behavior. If he doesn't think in a religious context, maybe less chance of seeking help or being rewarded with good deeds\u2014so perhaps low to medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: The highest risks seem to be from recent drug use and living circumstances. Since he has a GED and is college-bound, that should help lower the overall risk but the drug issue might tip it towards high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"White\", \"low\", \"Race can influence treatment effectiveness, but at 21 years old, this may not be a significant factor yet.\"),\n    (\"1 arrest and conviction\", \"medium\", \"One offense could impact recidivism risk, especially if it's minor or recent.\"),\n    (\"5'7\"/140 lbs\", \"low\", \"Weight alone typically doesn't predict recidivism without other factors like education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Never married living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate independence but may lack support network risks.\"),\n    (\"GED and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Education, especially a GED, is associated with lower recidivism risk and stability.\"),\n    (\"1 job in past year\", \"low\", \"Job stability generally reduces reoffending rates, though one job might be precarious.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can lead to risky behaviors or increased motivation for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Living with 3 siblings in an urban area at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Young age and multi-person household may offer some support but could also present challenges.\"),\n    (\"Doesn't believe in God\", \"low\", \"Non-religious beliefs might affect seeking help or community support, potentially increasing risk slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
