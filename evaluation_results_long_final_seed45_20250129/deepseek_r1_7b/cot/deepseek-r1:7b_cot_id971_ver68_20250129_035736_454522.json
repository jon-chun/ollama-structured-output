Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young, but he has a prior conviction, so that might indicate some past behavior issues. He has a GED and is in college, which suggests he has the education to potentially get better job opportunities or support himself.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which could be a red flag for recidivism. Maybe his prior offense was something minor? But I don't know the nature of it yet.\n\nHis height and weight aren't factors here, so I can skip that.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have support around him. Living in urban areas with three people isn't great for someone who has issues, but since he's 21, maybe he's moved out on his own.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and recently felt down. That could impact his mental state, affecting his ability to function or commit new crimes. He might be struggling mentally which could contribute to him getting involved in trouble again.\n\nHe had a tough childhood with three people at home, which could mean instability\u2014could lead to behavioral issues or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might make him look for other reasons for his problems, possibly leading to self-harm or feeling hopeless, which can affect judgment and decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: He has prior criminal history, some drug use, living alone with unstable family environment. The GED and college enrollment are positive signs but he's still young, so maybe the negative factors outweigh the positives. His mental health issues might make him more prone to substance abuse again, which could lead to higher recidivism risk.\n\nI think his relative risk is medium because there are multiple factors pointing towards a moderate chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young, suggesting he may still have the cognitive and life skills to avoid reoffending.

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
