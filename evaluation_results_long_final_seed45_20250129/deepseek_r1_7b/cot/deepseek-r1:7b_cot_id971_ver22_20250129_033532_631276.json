    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. He's white, hasn't been married, living alone, has a GED and is in college. He used marijuana in the past four years but felt really down recently. His background was tough: he lived with his mom at age 3 in an urban area, which might have affected his stability. Also, he doesn't believe in God, so maybe that affects his coping mechanisms.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each factor individually and see how they contribute to recidivism risk.\n\nHis previous convictions \u2013 just one before. That's a medium risk because past criminal history is a strong indicator of future behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which are positive steps. Education can help him get better job opportunities, so that might lower the risk \u2013 maybe low or medium.\n\nHe uses marijuana; while it doesn't have the same severe penalties as other drugs, it's still substance use. He felt really down recently, which could indicate underlying issues he's struggling with, perhaps leading to more substance use in the future. That's a medium risk factor because substance abuse is significant but maybe not the highest.\n\nLiving alone at 21 might be a red flag. Social support can help with stress and mental health issues, so living alone increases the risk \u2013 high.\n\nRelying on God for comfort isn't helpful; this could lead to coping with negative emotions in other ways, which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues. High risk factor because lack of support system is bad.\n\nYoung age at first offense (17-18) is also a high risk because younger offenders often have different needs and may not be as committed to positive outcomes.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium from priorconv, low from education, medium from marijuana use, high from living alone, high from lack of support, and high from young age. So the overall prediction leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Past criminal history is a significant factor in predicting future recidivism.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
