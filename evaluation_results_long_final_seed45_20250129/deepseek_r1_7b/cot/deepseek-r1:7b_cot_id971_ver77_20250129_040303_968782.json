    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a query where someone is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to evaluate the recidivism risk for a 21-year-old male based on several factors over a three-year period. The user has provided detailed information about the individual's background and current situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each factor they've listed and how it contributes to rearrest risk. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe person is White. I know that race can influence recidivism due to systemic factors like over-policing and biased law enforcement. However, since he's been convicted once, this might be more about his personal circumstances rather than his race itself.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education levels are often correlates with lower recidivism because they're more likely to find better opportunities or support after incarceration. So his GED might actually reduce the risk here.\n\nHis height and weight aren't factors, so I can ignore those specifics.\n\nHe's single and living alone. Being single doesn't directly indicate high risk, but living alone could be a risk factor if there's no one to help him if he starts feeling down or encounters problems.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana before and during the past month felt down. drug use is linked to higher recidivism because it can lead to more risky behavior or self-harm, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nYouthful living with his biological mother in a household of three suggests he experienced family stress or neglect at an early age. This could contribute to behavioral issues and higher risk later on.\n\nHe believes that God has no influence over his life. This lack of religious support can lead to increased spirituality issues, which might be a sign of deeper personal problems affecting his decision-making and relationships.\n\nPutting this all together, the drug use history is a significant red flag because it's tied to risky behavior and mental health issues. The lack of family support from his mother living with him could indicate underlying issues that might persist. His age (21) isn't old enough for severe recidivism, but considering other factors like being single and having substance abuse, he might face more challenges in the future.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think it's reasonable to assign a higher relative weight to the drug use history compared to some of the others. The overall risk assessment leans towards high because despite some mitigating factors like education and being single, the drug history is a strong indicator of potential issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years, which could indicate risky behavior that may increase the likelihood of reoffending.
