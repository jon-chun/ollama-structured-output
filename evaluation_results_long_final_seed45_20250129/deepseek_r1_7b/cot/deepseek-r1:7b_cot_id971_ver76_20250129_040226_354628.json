    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to analyze this risk assessment for a 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can be more impulsive and have less life experience, which might increase the risk of recidivism compared to older individuals who are closer to middle age or have established lives.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't see any information indicating a specific racial bias here. However, race itself isn't a direct indicator without context like systemic issues or historical data in his area.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That's only one offense at this point, which might not be severe enough to immediately indicate high risk, but it does show some criminal history that could predict past behavior influencing future decisions.\n\nHeight is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 140 lbs. No direct info on how these physical attributes relate to recidivism, so I'll assign low here.\n\nNever married living alone. Living situation can affect mental health\u2014being single might mean less support network, possibly leading to higher stress or substance use issues.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level can be positive if it's leading him towards better opportunities, but he's also using drugs, which could negate that benefit.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment history is a good indicator of stability; one job might not be enough for long-term success but shows some commitment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behavior and mental health issues, which are red flags for recidivism.\n\nYou mentioned he feels nothing towards God, suggesting religious support isn't present. This could indicate potential lack of spiritual guidance or support systems that might help him cope with stress or negative emotions.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Small family size and living in an urban environment can sometimes correlate with different social environments, but without more info on the dynamics, it's hard to assess impact.\n\nNo mention of other risk factors like mental health issues, family issues, or prior supervision.\n\nPutting this all together: There are some negative indicators that point towards a low to medium risk. However, considering his age and living situation alone, maybe leaning towards low risk.\n\nWait, but the drug use is significant\u2014especially the recent feelings of low mood which could be a sign of substance abuse leading to mental health issues. That might push it up to medium or high.\n\nBut without knowing how he's doing in school or if he's making efforts to improve, it's hard. His age still makes him more vulnerable.\n\nI think overall, considering all factors, the risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults can be more impulsive and have less life experience, increasing risk compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse, especially recent mood issues, could indicate potential for further issues and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a support network might lead to stress or substance use, but no direct high risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being in college can be positive if leading towards better opportunities, though drug issues may offset this slight negative trend.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
