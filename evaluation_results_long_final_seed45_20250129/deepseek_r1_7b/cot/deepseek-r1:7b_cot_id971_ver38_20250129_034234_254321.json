    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Young adults can sometimes be more rebellious or less experienced with the system. That might be a medium risk because while it's not high, it's also not low either.\n\nRace: He identifies as White. From what I know, race can influence recidivism rates, but in many systems, it's more about specific factors than overall race. So maybe this is a low factor unless there's more info suggesting otherwise.\n\nConvictions: He has one. A prior conviction does increase the risk because of recidivism. That should be high.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and recently. Substance abuse is a big deal for recidivism, so that's definitely a high factor.\n\nMarital status: He's living alone and never been married. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might contribute to higher risk of issues like drug use or mental health problems leading to reoffending. So medium maybe?\n\nEmployment: He has a GED and is in college. Education usually helps reduce recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nNumber of jobs: Only one job during the year. Unstable employment can lead to poverty and other issues that might push someone back into trouble. Medium risk here.\n\nMental health: He feels down sometimes and doesn't seek help. Mental health issues can make reoffending more likely. This is a medium factor because while it's serious, there might be signs of improvement or he might get better without intervention.\n\nHome environment: At young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That's concerning. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors. Also, living with multiple people could lead to abuse or neglect issues. High risk from this factor.\n\nReligion: He doesn't believe in God. Lack of religious support might mean less community involvement or fewer resources for getting help, which could increase risk. Medium maybe?\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction is a big red flag (high). Drug use and mental health are also significant issues (both high). Age being 21 adds some risk but not the highest. Living alone and family environment are medium factors. Education and job status are low.\n\nSo, overall prediction would be high risk for rearrest because of the prior conviction, drug use, and family issues. The confidence is probably around 85% since most factors lean towards high or medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults can sometimes be more rebellious or less experienced with the system, increasing risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant factor without specific circumstances indicating bias or discrimination\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a major predictor of reoffending\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which might contribute to higher risk of issues like drug use or mental health problems leading to reoffending\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Education and being in college typically reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to poverty and other issues that might push someone back into trouble\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can make reoffending more likely, though signs of improvement are noted\"),\n    (\"Home Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an urban area with a household of three and previous neglect or abuse significantly increases risk\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious support might mean less community involvement or fewer resources for getting help\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
