    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black and has been arrested once but not convicted. From what I know, having a criminal history can increase risk, especially if it's a misdemeanor or felony. But since her arrest isn't a conviction yet, maybe the weight is lower than someone with a full conviction. So that might be low to medium.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight doesn't directly affect recidivism much unless there are health issues, but she hasn't used drugs in four years and isn't depressed recently, so maybe no immediate risk factors from this aspect. So probably low.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which might help reduce risk. Maybe medium because she has some personal stability, but not a strong one.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college shows she's education-focused. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so this factor would be low.\n\nShe held one job last year. Employment, especially full-time, can lead to better opportunities and financial stability, which are protective factors. So maybe low.\n\nNo drug use for four years \u2013 that's a positive indicator of substance control. Low risk here.\n\nNot depressed in the past month; emotional well-being is linked to lower recidivism rates. So this factor would be low.\n\nYoung age at 19 and living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This might indicate she has family support, which could actually help reduce risk. Maybe medium because urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or different social dynamics, but the supportive family environment is protective.\n\nShe believes in God's influence on her life. Religious factors can provide moral guidance and support, reducing risk. So perhaps low to medium.\n\nNow, putting it all together: most of her factors are protective except maybe the urban living situation at a young age with limited family support. But even that might not tip the scales too much towards high risk. So overall, she's probably low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (not convicted)\", \"low\", \"Her arrest is not a conviction, which may reduce the immediate recidivism risk compared to someone with a full conviction.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (190 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No significant health indicators related to substance use or depression affecting her recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor, but she has personal stability as indicated by her education and employment history.\"),\n    (\"Education level (high school diploma, in college)\", \"low\", \" Education is generally protective against recidivism, especially with ongoing educational pursuits.\"),\n    (\"Employment (held one job last year)\", \"low\", \"Having a job, even if brief, can contribute to positive life choices and reduced risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (never used drugs in past four years)\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use issues are noted, indicating good health and substance control.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (not depressed in past month)\", \"low\", \"No recent signs of depression suggest stable mental health and lower risk factors related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Family background (young age living with biological mother in urban area with household size 5)\", \"medium\", \"While family support is positive, an urban environment at a young age could have different social dynamics that may not necessarily be protective but also not strongly risk-raising.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief in God's influence on life\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and support, reducing potential risk factors related to spiritual neglect or abuse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
