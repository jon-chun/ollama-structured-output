    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who provided a detailed query about a criminal risk assessment. They want me to assign relative weights to each risk factor and then predict rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, let's break down the individual's background. He's 21, male, White, with one prior arrest and conviction. Age is important because younger individuals often have less life experience which can be a mitigating factor, so maybe low to medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's committed to further education\u2014probably a good sign for reintegration into society, so maybe lower risk factors here.\n\nNot being married and living alone might indicate some instability.\u5355\u8eab\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u652f\u6301\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u5e26\u6765\u538b\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u8fdb\u53bb\u3002\n\nDrug use history is present but not recent. He used marijuana before and recently felt down. This could show substance abuse issues, which are typically high risk because of the potential for relapse.\n\nLiving with his mother in a household of three in an urban area adds some context about family support or possible neglect. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's something to consider as medium risk.\n\nConsidering God has no role in his life suggests he might not seek support from religious communities, which could affect social connections and support systems\u2014another medium factor.\n\nHe feels down a lot, which might relate to depression or other mental health issues. High risk here because mental health impacts recidivism rates significantly.\n\nPutting this all together, the high risk factors are drug use, emotional distress, and family dynamics. The mitigating factors include education level, age, and stable living situation. \n\nI need to assign each factor a low, medium, or high weight based on their impact. Drug use is high, emotional distress is high, family background is medium (since he's living alone but with his mother), and the rest are lower.\n\nFinally, integrating these factors into a prediction model. High risk for recidivism due to multiple high-risk factors, so I'd predict \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate less life experience and potentially higher adaptability to new environments, mitigating risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and felt down during the past month.
