    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male reoffending within three years. He's White, hasn't been married, living alone, has a GED, is in college, worked one job, used marijuana, felt down recently, lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area, and doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life.\n\nFirst, the low factors: His age of 21 might be a positive because he's young. He has a GED which could indicate some commitment to education or maybe not. Employing one job shows he has some steady work history but only once. Living alone is common among younger adults and doesn't necessarily predict future issues unless there's instability elsewhere.\n\nHis low factors also include being in college, using marijuana (which isn't severe), feeling down recently\u2014he might be experiencing personal issues or stressors that could influence his behavior. Not being married at 21 is another neutral point since many people get married later.\n\nThe high risk factors are more concerning: He's been convicted once before, which is a significant criminal history indicating past misconduct. His past four-year drug use (marijuana) might be a red flag if it's frequent or severe, but only mentioned once here. However, the fact that he feels down and can't cope suggests possible mental health issues or underlying stressors.\n\nLiving with his mother in a household of three urban setting could mean environment where he's exposed to certain influences\u2014maybe not necessarily bad, but could be a point if there are other factors like lack of support or neglect. His lack of religious belief might lead him towards alternative coping mechanisms which could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The high risk is mainly driven by the prior conviction and possible mental health issues. While some factors lean low, these two high factors significantly increase the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which indicates past misconduct and can be a significant indicator of potential future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"medium\", \"While he has used marijuana in the past four years, it's important to consider if this use is frequent or severe as it could impact recidivism risk.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
