    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let me break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male with a White background. He has one arrest and a conviction, which immediately raises some alarm bells because being in custody at such an early age can be a red flag for more serious offenses.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight alone isn't a huge concern unless it's significantly below or above his ideal weight, but he seems within a healthy range. So maybe this factor doesn't add much risk here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates because people might be more vulnerable to substance abuse or other factors. But since he's an only child (I assume) based on the family history, maybe that's not as big of a concern. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. GED holders often have better job prospects but can also be at risk if they're struggling academically or facing other obstacles. Being enrolled in college might indicate he's committed to improving himself, which could reduce risk.\n\nHe only held one job during the year. Having a steady job for an extended period usually shows responsibility and commitment to his future. However, if that job was temporary or he's facing issues, maybe there's underlying problems. But with just one job, it might not be enough to predict high risk.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years. That's concerning because even occasional drug use can impair judgment and decision-making. It could indicate a higher tendency for substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe felt down during the past month so much that nothing could cheer him up. This is a significant factor. Persistent feelings of low mood without any improvement could be indicative of depression or anxiety, both of which are risk factors linked to substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nFamily history: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Sharing a home at such a young age can sometimes lead to emotional neglect if the environment isn't supportive. The fact that it's an urban setting might mean better access to resources but could also correlate with higher stress or instability.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which might affect his personal motivations and decision-making regarding law enforcement. If he feels no divine guidance, he might make decisions based on self-interest, which can sometimes lead to impulsive behaviors that could result in criminal actions.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning factors are the drug use (high), persistent low mood (high), and the family environment at a young age (medium). The GED and college enrollment might mitigate some risk. He's an only child, so living alone doesn't add much here. His job situation is neutral.\n\nThe high risk from drug use and mood issues would likely predict a high chance of rearrest. Even with mitigating factors like education and being in college, the other two factors point towards a significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"This individual has admitted to marijuana use over the past four years and felt down for the past month without any positive triggers.
