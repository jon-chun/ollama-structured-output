    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old male with several factors contributing to his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults are generally at lower risk compared to older individuals because they're more likely to still be in school or actively job-seeking. However, even though he's young, it doesn't automatically make him a low risk unless other factors counterbalance that.\n\nHe has a White identifier, but race can influence recidivism based on systemic issues and historical data. However, without specific information indicating discrimination, this factor might lean towards medium because while it's relevant, it's not directly tied to his behavior or circumstances here.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. A single prior offense increases the risk of reoffending compared to someone with no criminal history. One conviction is a significant factor; it shows he has a criminal history which can impact his ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nHis height is 5'7\", weight 140 lbs, but these physical attributes alone don't directly contribute to recidivism risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or living situation. So this might be low.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living in a stable environment is important for recidivism. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher stress or lower support, which could increase risk, but without knowing more about his living arrangements or social support network, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe medium.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education generally reduces the risk of recidivism because it provides alternative pathways out of prison. However, the fact that he's actively pursuing higher education might indicate motivation and willingness to change, which could lower his risk compared to someone with less involvement in educational opportunities. So maybe medium.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment is a positive factor as it can lead to stable income and reduced dependence on incarceration for financial needs. However, he's been unemployed or underemployed before, given he only held one job in the past year. That could be a red flag because prior instability might signal underlying issues.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can contribute to other criminal behaviors or increased risk of relapse. Additionally, he felt down and couldn't find comfort during the past month. This could suggest depression or anxiety, which are comorbid with substance use and can worsen recidivism chances.\n\nHe lived at a young age in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in such conditions might have had negative effects on his mental health or behavior, possibly leading to the current issues. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates but without knowing the surrounding environment's safety, it's hard to assess.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, indicating a potential lack of religious support system which might contribute to stress or coping mechanisms. This could be another risk factor due to the absence of a support network.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (high), education and college enrollment (medium positive), living alone (maybe medium depending on circumstances), one job (positive but maybe low if past instability), substance use (high risk), and other factors like living with family in an urban area, race, age, and belief system. The strongest risk factors seem to be the prior arrest, substance use, and possibly his current living situation.\n\nSo overall, I would lean towards a high risk assessment because of the presence of multiple high-risk factors that outweigh the mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"A single prior arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending compared to individuals with no criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use and feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a strong support network may increase stress levels and risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year might indicate some stability, but prior instability could signal underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with family in an urban area is generally stable; however, lack of religious support may affect mental health and coping mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Race and Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence recidivism due to systemic factors, the absence of specific discrimination makes this factor less impactful here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
