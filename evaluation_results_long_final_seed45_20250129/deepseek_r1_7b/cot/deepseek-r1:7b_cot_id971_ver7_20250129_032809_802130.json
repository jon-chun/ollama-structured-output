    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for a 21-year-old male based on the factors provided. He's White, has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. His physical stats are average height and weight, which don't immediately raise red flags. He's living alone, never married, so no immediate family support.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which might indicate some level of education but also perhaps instability if he's struggling. Only one job during the year suggests limited income stability or steady employment history. His drug use history includes marijuana in the past four years, with recent use in the last month, which could be concerning for recidivism.\n\nGrowing up in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area might have had some stressors, and his rejection of religion could influence his mental health or life choices. His recent feelings of low mood without any specific trigger is notable\u2014could point to underlying issues affecting his behavior.\n\nLooking at each factor: Age 21 isn't a big risk indicator on its own, but having a prior criminal record does. Education level and employment might correlate with lower risk if stable, but here it's just one job. The recent drug use, especially the downward mood, raises red flags about possible substance abuse impacting his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these together, I think he has some moderate factors that could contribute to recidivism. So, the prediction would lean towards a YES for rearrest in the next three years, but with lower confidence since some factors are mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is generally considered within the low-risk range for recidivism as adults often have more life experience and stability.
