    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I'm not sure if being White has a direct impact on recidivism rates compared to other racial groups. Maybe it's more about systemic issues rather than individual risk here, so probably low weight.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. So this should be high weight.\n\nHis age is 21, which is relatively young. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals, but factors like being in college might influence that. Still, maybe medium weight since it's a relevant factor.\n\nHe identifies as living alone with no children or partner. Living alone can increase stress and isolation, which are known risk factors for substance abuse and other crimes. So this should be high weight.\n\nNo ties means he doesn't have family support, which is a red flag. Family support usually reduces recidivism, so absence of it increases the risk. High weight here.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education can positively influence outcomes, but maybe being in higher education could mean he's more motivated to change his behavior. Still, it's somewhat mitigating, so medium weight.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment is linked to higher recidivism because it can lead to dependency on substances and other negative behaviors. So this should be high weight.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) shows substance abuse, which definitely increases risk. High weight here.\n\nHe felt down recently and couldn't find anything to cheer him up. This indicates low self-esteem or possibly depression, both linked to higher recidivism rates because these states can lead to risky behaviors. High weight.\n\nYoung age at first arrest might suggest impulsive behavior or lack of life experience, which are risk factors. Medium weight since it's a relevant factor but not as significant as other points.\n\nLiving with three people in an urban area could be stressful and might contribute to substance abuse or other issues. High weight because urban environments can have negative influences.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life suggests he may engage in self-destructive behaviors, which are strong risk factors for recidivism. High weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest history is a major point (high), living alone and without family support (high), substance use (high), recent low mood (high), and being young with prior offense (medium). The GED and college enrollment might somewhat mitigate but aren't as strong. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Past criminal behavior is a significant indicator of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress and isolation, which may contribute to substance abuse and other risks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years indicates potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Recent Low Mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down without cause suggests possible depression or low self-esteem, both linked to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Youthful Offense at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Impulsive behavior and lack of life experience can be associated with higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
