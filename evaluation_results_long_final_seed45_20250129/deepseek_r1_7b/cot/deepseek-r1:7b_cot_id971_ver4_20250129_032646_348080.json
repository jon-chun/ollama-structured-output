His physical traits are average height and weight.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which might indicate he's independent but could also mean he's not in a supportive environment. He has a GED and is in college, so maybe he's looking to get better education or change his situation.\n\nHe's only held one job, which suggests limited income stability. He uses marijuana sometimes, which can affect his mental state; feeling down might influence his decision-making. \n\nGrowing up in a household of three with his mother in an urban area could have shaped his behavior and relationships. His lack of religious involvement might mean he doesn't seek support, but it's also a risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting all these together: He has prior criminal history, maybe not much education beyond GED, living alone which is a risk for dependency issues, substance use, and unstable home environment. These factors collectively point towards a higher risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, indicating past involvement in the legal system which could correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"independent_living\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase vulnerability to stressors and substance use, which can be precursors to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, and feelings of low mood may impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"unstable_environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of three with limited support from the biological mother could create an unstable early life experience that may influence risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests some educational attainability, which might indicate a desire to change circumstances, though limited job experience is noted.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
