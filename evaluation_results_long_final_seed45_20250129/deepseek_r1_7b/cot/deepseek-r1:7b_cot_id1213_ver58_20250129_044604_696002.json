    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history of one arrest but no conviction. That might be considered low risk since there's some caution involved without full accountability. But she's only been in custody once, so maybe the recidivism rate here is lower than someone with more convictions.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs and is 5'6\". Weight can sometimes be a factor, but at this age, she's still developing. There doesn't seem to be any sign of drug use as her last four years haven't involved drugs, which is a positive indicator for low risk.\n\nShe's living alone, which I think might correlate with lower risk because she has no one to look out for her. She's not married and doesn't have children mentioned, so family support isn't an issue here.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment suggest she's actively trying to improve herself educationally. Employing a job once indicates responsibility and perhaps some life skills. That's a good sign for low risk.\n\nHer living situation at a young age in a household of five with her biological mother might have some implications, but since it was urban area and she has faith, maybe the support system is intact. No recent drug use or depression also adds to her stability.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor seems to lean towards low risk without significant red flags.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (1x, no conviction)\", \"low\", \"Her one arrest, though not a conviction, suggests past caution.
