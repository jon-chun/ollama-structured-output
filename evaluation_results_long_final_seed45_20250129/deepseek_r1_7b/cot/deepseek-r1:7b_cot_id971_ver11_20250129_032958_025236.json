    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old male with various factors contributing to his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: He has one prior arrest and a conviction, which immediately raises concerns about reoffending. That's definitely high weight.\n\nHis race is White, but in the US, there are some disparities in recidivism rates even among different races, so I should consider that as medium.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs; no direct impact on recidivism here unless it affects his ability to perform certain jobs. So low weight.\n\nNot married and living alone: Living situation isn't directly linked without considering specific circumstances, so probably low.\n\nHaving a GED instead of a degree might affect job prospects, increasing risk slightly\u2014maybe medium.\n\nEnrolled in college shows commitment; that could be positive but also maybe lower risk if he's focused on studying. Medium weight.\n\nOnly one job in the past year: Unemployment can contribute to recidivism, so medium.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana and recent feelings of low mood: Drug use is a significant risk factor, high weight.\n\nYoung age at first arrest (probably early), which often correlates with higher recidivism rates\u2014high weight.\n\nLiving with his mother in a household of three suggests he's not alone, but maybe a less stable environment. Medium weight.\n\nNo involvement with God affecting his outlook; but this is more about personal belief and might not directly impact risk factors related to substance abuse or other observable factors\u2014so low.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors include prior arrest, drug use, age at first offense. Medium includes GED, living situation, job history, race. Low factors are height, weight, non-married status.\n\nConsidering these, the overall risk is high because of the significant negative factors outweighing the positives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"Individual has a prior arrest and conviction which indicates potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Positive drug use history is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Young Age at First Offense\", \"high\", \"Early age of first offense correlates with higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED vs College Degree\", \"medium\", \"Possession of GED might affect job prospects and could be a mitigating factor, but not directly a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Single Job History\", \"medium\", \"Employment status can influence stability, but one job history is generally considered positive unless circumstances are dire.\"), \n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use contributes to ongoing substance abuse issues which increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living situation alone does not directly impact risk without specific underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Family History (Household Size 3)\", \"medium\", \"Family dynamics can influence behavior, but size 3 is considered average and not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"Non-Involvement with God\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may vary widely and are not typically directly linked to recidivism risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
