    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help this user who is a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They've provided detailed information about a 19-year-old female and want me to assign relative weights to each risk factor before predicting her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors one by one. She has only been arrested once but not convicted, which might be low risk since she hasn't received any formal convictions. Her weight is 190 lbs; body type alone doesn't usually predict recidivism much, so that's probably a low factor.\n\nShe's living alone, never married\u2014maybe living solitarily can reduce interactions that could lead to issues, but it might also be a sign of higher independence, which isn't directly a risk. High school diploma and college enrollment suggest some education, which is positive as better education often correlates with lower recidivism.\n\nShe held one job during the year; maybe she's self-sufficient enough not to rely on criminal activities for income. No drug use in four years\u2014consistent substance use patterns are usually indicators of low risk unless there's a change.\n\nNo recent depression\u2014mental health is linked to recidivism, so this factor leans towards lower risk. She lived with her mother at a young age in an urban area; that could be a complex situation but might have protective elements too, depending on the dynamics. Considering God as something influential\u2014religion can sometimes correlate with pro-social behaviors or higher moral standards.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point to low risk. Only the high school diploma being recent (she enrolled in college) and her living situation with her mother could potentially be areas of concern, but they don't necessarily increase risk. So I'll assign mostly low risks with two medium ones. The prediction is a \"NO\" for rearrest, but my confidence is 75% because while the factors lean towards safety, there's always some uncertainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has only been arrested once and has not been convicted.
