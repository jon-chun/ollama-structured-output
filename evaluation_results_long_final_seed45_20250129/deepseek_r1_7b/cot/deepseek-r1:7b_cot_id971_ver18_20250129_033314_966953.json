    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with this query where I need to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. The user wants me to assign weights to several risk factors and predict rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male of White descent. He's been arrested once and convicted. His age suggests he's in his early twenties, which might indicate he's still developing his life skills, but I need to consider that first offense could be a significant factor.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't usually a major risk factor unless there are health issues, but here it's just about height and weight without additional context, so maybe \"low\".\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation alone can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism because he might not have support for substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Completing high school and going to college usually indicates better educational opportunities, which might lower the risk of recidivism. So that's probably \"low\".\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism. Since he only has one job, maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for part of the last month. While he hasn't been convicted for drug use yet, this could be a sign of potential substance abuse issues affecting his future behavior.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This suggests he might have experienced family dysfunction or trauma, which are strong risk factors, maybe \"high\".\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and sees it as unrelated to his personal life. This could be associated with higher self-esteem issues but also possibly more resilience if it's not affecting his substance use.\n\nPutting this all together: The high school completion and college enrollment probably lower the risk, while past drug use and family background might increase it. The job history is in between. Considering all these factors, I'd lean towards a \"YES\" prediction with medium confidence because some factors point higher but others mitigate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate limited life experience that could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for part of the last month; this could indicate potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"He is living alone, which may be a risk factor if it leads to isolation or lack of support network, but he has never been married, which might suggest he relies on himself more than others.\"), \n    (\"Education Level and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"He has a GED and is enrolled in college, indicating ongoing efforts toward education and potentially better life outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"He held only one job during the year; unemployment or underemployment can sometimes be linked to substance abuse issues or other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area; this could indicate family dysfunction or trauma that may influence future behavior and recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
