    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a risk factor rating to this 21-year-old male and predict his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, but since he has only one prior conviction and is relatively young, this might not be a huge factor here. Maybe it's low risk regarding this aspect.\n\nHe's got a GED and is in college, which are positive factors because education often leads to better job opportunities and support systems. So that should probably be a low or medium weight.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but since he has a GED and is attending college, it might not be as high as if he were living with someone who could provide more support.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse can impede job performance and lead to other issues, so this should be a medium or high weight.\n\nFeeling down for much of the month might indicate underlying mental health issues, which are serious. High risk here.\n\nYouthful living with his biological mother in a household of three could have both positive and negative aspects. It's urban, so maybe more stress but also potential support structures. Still, it's something to note as medium.\n\nConsidering his belief in God might influence his motivation towards positive behavior or crime, which could be mixed. Not the most significant factor here, so low weight.\n\nPutting all this together: Drug use and feeling down are high; living with a household of three is medium; others are low. So overall risk should be medium to high. Based on these factors, I think he's at a higher risk, so my prediction would lean towards YES, but maybe not too confident because some factors like education might mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which may influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
