    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger adults are generally less likely to reoffend compared to older individuals who have more life experience and potentially higher substance use or criminal tendencies. So that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black, but I'm not sure how race factors into recidivism here since it's a sensitive issue with varying societal impacts. However, without specific data linking her race directly to higher rearrest rates in this context, maybe it's neutral. But I should note that race can be a significant factor depending on systemic issues.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A non-convicted arrest might indicate she's facing potential barriers to conviction, which could affect the severity of her situation. Maybe medium risk here because even if not convicted, the arrest could have legal or psychological impacts.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism. She's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. No information suggests she's struggling with health issues, so probably low risk based on physical factors alone.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living arrangements can influence her social support network, which affects her ability to get help or stay out of trouble. Since she's living alone, maybe medium risk because isolation might increase stress or substance use without support.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level is positively correlated with lower recidivism rates as higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this would be low risk since she has both a diploma and is pursuing further education.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job history is another positive indicator, as stable employment reduces stress and substance use risks. One job might indicate recent employability but doesn't necessarily correlate with future recidivism unless it's unstable or related to illegal activities, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years; she feels no depression over the past month. These are positive factors that reduce the likelihood of substance abuse and mental health issues contributing to recidivism. So definitely low risk for these aspects.\n\nHer young age at living with her biological mother suggests she had a more supportive environment as a child, which is protective against many negative influences. Being raised in an urban area might have some negatives, but without specific data on crime rates or social factors there, maybe it's neutral. Still, living with the biological mother could be high risk because of potential emotional or stabilizing influences.\n\nShe believes God plays a role in her life, which is a positive factor as spirituality can provide support and reduce stress. So this might slightly lower risk, but since it's not directly tied to criminal behavior, maybe medium?\n\nPutting all these together: the factors are mostly low except for maybe living with a mother in an urban area and the influence of her religion. The job history is good, education level is solid, no drug use or depression. So overall, I'd lean towards low risk but perhaps slightly higher due to some factors that might not be as mitigating.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals typically have less recidivism compared to older adults with more life experience and potential criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"neutral\", \"While race can influence recidivism, there's no direct data linking this individual's Black identity to higher rearrest rates in this context.\"),\n    (\"Non-Convicted Arrest\", \"medium\", \"An arrest that isn't leading to a conviction could impact the severity and thus risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living independently might increase stress or substance use without social support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college provides stability and reduces stress associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"One job during the year indicates recent employability, which can reduce stress and substance-related risks.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk of relapse or illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month further reduces the likelihood of substance abuse linked to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother at a young age suggests a supportive environment, but an urban area could have influences on behavior that might not be directly mitigated.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believing in God can provide support and reduce stress, contributing to lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
