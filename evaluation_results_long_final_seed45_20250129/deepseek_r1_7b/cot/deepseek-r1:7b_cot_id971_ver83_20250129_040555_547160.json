    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive or have less life experience, which might make him a bit more at risk, but I don't know how significant that is yet.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race plays a big role here, especially since he's only been convicted once and doesn't have any other serious convictions. Maybe it's just background info.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually helps with job opportunities and stability, so maybe this lowers his risk a bit. But I'm not sure how much of an impact that has compared to other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. That might mean he doesn't have the support system that could help him stay on track, but again, it depends on other factors like substance use.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years, which isn't too bad, but some of the time in the last month he felt really down and couldn't cheer himself up. That's a strong indicator. Feeling \"down\" often is linked to deeper issues that might lead him back into substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Being raised in such circumstances can have both positive and negative effects, but the fact that he considers God unrelated to his life suggests he doesn't get spiritual support when things go wrong, which might be another risk factor.\n\nHis lack of religious support could mean fewer resources or help in dealing with stressors, increasing the chance of relapse.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a mix of positive factors like education and living away from home, but his drug use history and possible lack of support systems are significant negatives. The GED might counteract some of that, but the strong drug use history probably tips the scales toward high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis considers each factor's impact on recidivism:\n\n- **Drug Use History (High)**: The individual's recent marijuana use and persistent low mood suggest a higher risk of relapse or further substance abuse.\n- **Living Alone and Lack of Marital Support (High/Medium)**: Living alone may limit social support, which is crucial for maintaining sobriety and avoiding triggers.\n- **Drug Use in the Past Four Years (High)**: This history indicates potential substance use issues that could persist.\n- **Living in a Household of Three (Medium/Low)**: While living with family can provide support, the urban setting may offer fewer resources compared to rural areas.\n\n**Prediction**: The individual's drug use history and lack of significant support systems make them likely to be rearrested. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of drug use, particularly marijuana, which is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may limit access to support systems and resources, increasing the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Support Systems\", \"low\", \"Not being married might not be a significant factor unless combined with other factors like substance use or lack of family support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
