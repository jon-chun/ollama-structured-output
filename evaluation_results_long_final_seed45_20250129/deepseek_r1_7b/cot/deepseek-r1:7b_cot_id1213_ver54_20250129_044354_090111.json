    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's got a high school diploma but is in college, which might mean better job opportunities and higher education could help her stay out of trouble. Maybe that lowers her risk compared to someone without an education.\n\nShe has no prior convictions or arrests, so that's definitely a positive point. Zero criminal history usually means she hasn't been influenced by past mistakes as much.\n\nNow, looking at her demographics: Black female, age 19, living alone. I know there are some statistics about Black women having higher recidivism rates compared to White women, but it's not always consistent. Her environment might play a role here\u2014maybe she's in an urban area where crime rates could be higher.\n\nHer employment status is tricky because she has one job. Having income can help with stability and reduce opportunities for substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Plus, she's not using drugs recently, which is a good sign.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone\u2014maybe that contributes to lower risk as she might not be facing the same pressures as someone in a committed relationship. Also, her lack of depression could mean better mental health support system around her.\n\nHer past living situation with her biological mother in a household of five is interesting. Larger households can sometimes provide more stability but also stressors. However, since she's an adult now and considering God as part of her life, maybe she has personal support that helps her stay on track.\n\nPutting it all together: No prior issues, stable education and employment, living alone with a supportive environment (considering her spiritual aspect), no drug use, etc. These factors seem to lean towards lower risk. So I think the prediction is low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, indicating potential for learning and change.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma in progress suggests ongoing education which can aid stability.\"),\n    (\" employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employed full-time with a 2-year college enrollment implies financial stability and opportunities.\"),\n    (\" living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce exposure to potential risks compared to shared living situations.\"),\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Black female in urban area; higher crime rates for Black women can influence risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Living alone after never being married reduces relationship-induced pressures.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"No depression in past month and considering God as part of her life may provide support.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"Household size 5 with biological mother; larger households can be stressful but personal spirituality might mitigate risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
