    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. He's white, has a criminal history with one conviction, is 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs, living alone without a spouse. He has a GED, is in college, only worked one job recently, used marijuana in the past four years, felt down sometimes, lived with his biological mother in a household of three urban area, and doesn't believe in God affecting his life.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor. His age being 21 isn't too concerning yet; he's still developing. The criminal history is one time conviction, so that's moderate risk but not severe. He has a GED which might indicate some support system or willingness to change, but being in college could mean he's proactive.\n\nHis living situation alone with no spouse suggests maybe independence, but perhaps lack of emotional support. Drug use (marijuana) is present but recent; sometimes feeling down affects his motivation. That could influence his willingness to seek help or change.\n\nLiving with three people might offer some stability, but urban areas can have higher stressors. Believing in God not affecting him means he's self-directed; maybe harder to get motivated for positive actions.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a few risk factors like past use of drugs and living situation, but also some protective elements like education and college. The rearrest rate might be on the lower side compared to other factors, so I'd lean towards low risk with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor:\n\n- **Criminal History**: One time conviction indicates moderate risk.\n- **Education**: GED and college enrollment suggest a potential for positive change.\n- **Living Situation**: Living alone without a spouse might indicate independence but could also lack support.\n- **Drug Use**: Past use of marijuana is present but recent, which can influence motivation.\n- **Emotional State**: Feeling down sometimes may affect willingness to seek help or change.\n- **Family History**: lived with biological mother in a household of three urban area; this might offer some stability.\n\nConsidering these factors, the risk appears moderate. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"One time conviction indicates moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"GED and college enrollment suggest a potential for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse might indicate independence but could also lack support.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana is present but recent, which can influence motivation.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down sometimes may affect willingness to seek help or change.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Urban Area\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area might offer some stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
