    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, 21 years old with a GED and currently enrolled in college. Generally, having a GED can be a positive indicator as it shows some education, but being in college might indicate higher motivation or more focus on his goals. So maybe this isn't a strong risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Being single doesn't automatically make someone a bad risk, especially if he's attending college and presumably seeking a stable environment. But it's not a clear risk either.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can be a red flag because substance abuse often correlates with other issues like antisocial behavior or mental health problems. The recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying issues that could lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nHis background is interesting\u2014he lived with his biological mother at age 3 in an urban area, and he doesn't believe in God affecting his life. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, but it also depends on other factors like community support or lack thereof. Believing in God might indicate a sense of control or positivity that could offset some negatives.\n\nHe's had one arrest and one conviction, which is a significant risk factor. Recidivism tends to run higher for those with prior convictions because they have a history of breaking the law again.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a prior conviction, which is high risk. Drug use adds medium risk. His living situation in an urban area might be contributing but not as strongly. The GED and college attendance are mitigating factors. So overall, considering everything, his risk seems to lean towards high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which is a significant risk factor for recidivism as past convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can indicate potential issues such as substance abuse that may correlate with antisocial behavior or mental health concerns, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently pose a high risk without additional contextual factors like unstable living conditions or lack of support networks which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"education_and_college\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and attending college can be viewed as positive indicators that may offset risk factors, indicating higher motivation towards positive outcomes such as gaining education and skills which may aid in reintegration and preventing recidivism.\"),\n    (\"recent_mood_state\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood might indicate potential mental health issues or stressors that could influence substance use or antisocial behavior, increasing risk levels.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
