    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male with a White background. That might not directly impact his risk unless there are specific socioeconomic or cultural factors at play here, but I don't have information on that yet.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. A single prior offense is concerning, especially since it's his only one so far. Recidivism can be influenced by past behavior, so this might be a medium factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height typically influence recidivism rates much unless there's something else about his health or living situation that affects it, but nothing here suggests that.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a safer environment, but it might also mean he has less support to cope with stress or substance use issues. Maybe this could slightly increase the risk if he's struggling on his own.\n\nHe has a GED and is attending college. Having a GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, which might help in reducing future recidivism. However, if he's not actively engaged in education or employment, it could be a medium factor pushing him towards higher risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Job stability can influence recidivism because having steady income and benefits can provide motivation to change behavior. If he was laid off or didn't have many opportunities for alternative work, this might be considered low risk since having at least one job is positive.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially with substances like marijuana, can lead to behavioral issues, substance abuse problems, and could increase stress or depression, which are known predictors of recidivism. This seems like a high factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Shared environment factors can influence behavior and outcomes. Living in an urban area might offer more opportunities but could also be associated with higher stress or crime rates. However, since it's only one past living situation, I'm not sure how much that affects current risk.\n\nHe believes God has no role in his life. This lack of religious support could affect his coping mechanisms and decision-making regarding substance use and other risky behaviors. Without guidance from a religion, he might be more susceptible to negative influences or self-harm, which are red flags for recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (medium), marijuana use (high), living alone (maybe medium), lack of religious support (possibly high). The job situation and education seem positive but aren't strong enough to offset the negatives. So overall, I would rate his risk as medium with a lower confidence because some factors are pushing him towards higher risk despite others being positive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest can increase the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates past behavior that may not be resolved.\"),\n    (\"marijuana_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is a known predictor of substance abuse and behavioral issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can offer some isolation but also presents challenges in coping with stress or substance use issues without support.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_religion\", \"high\", \"Believing God has no role may affect coping mechanisms and decision-making, increasing susceptibility to negative influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
