    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. From what I know, there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can affect outcomes based on race. This might play a role here, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it doesn't impact her risk as much at this stage.\n\nShe has only one arrest and no conviction. That means she's not behind bars, so there's less history of serious offense involvement. But even a single non-convicted arrest can sometimes be noted on a resume or cover letter, which might raise a little concern without more context.\n\nHer height is 5'6\" and she weighs 190 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct risk factor unless it's related to substance use or health issues. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that seems clean. No depression in the past month either, which suggests her mental health is stable.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Young people often face challenges without family support, but I'm not sure how that translates into recidivism risk. Maybe less support could mean higher risk? But it might also depend on other factors she has control over.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. She's only held one job, which isn't bad, but having some work experience can be positive too.\n\nLooking at her past home environment: when she was young, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That might have had its challenges\u2014crowded living, maybe less stability\u2014but again, how does that affect recidivism? It could potentially increase stress or neglect but without more info on family dynamics now, it's hard to say.\n\nHer religious affiliation is God, which often correlates with pro-social behavior and personal responsibility. So this might mitigate any negative factors from her past home environment.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions mean she's not a risk of reoffending immediately. Her education and job are positive signs. The arrest doesn't affect her since it's non-convicted. The urban living with many people could have been stressful, but her current living situation is alone, which might be better for stability.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think she has a low risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has one non-convicted arrest, indicating no immediate criminal history that could predict reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and current college enrollment, along with job experience, suggest strong personal and professional capabilities to avoid recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Past Home Environment\", \"low\", \"Living in a crowded urban area at a young age may have had challenges but her current living situation is alone, which might indicate better stability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"high\", \"Pro-social behavior associated with religious involvement could mitigate negative influences from past home environment and increase personal responsibility.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
