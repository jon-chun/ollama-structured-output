    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has only been arrested once but not convicted. That might seem like a good thing because it shows she's managed to avoid legal trouble without facing consequences. I don't think that alone should raise her risk too much, so maybe this is a low or medium factor?\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs at 5'6\". That's pretty heavy for her age. Weight could be a concern in terms of substance use, but she hasn't used drugs in the past four years. So maybe the weight doesn't directly correlate to drug-related issues anymore. Still, it might be worth noting as a low factor.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Being single can sometimes mean less supervision, which could have its pros and cons. But since she has support from her mother at home, maybe that mitigates some risk factors related to living arrangements. So perhaps this isn't a high risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma with college enrollment suggests she's educated and might be motivated to change her circumstances. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this could actually lower her risk. Maybe low or medium.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some employment experience is positive because it shows stability and commitment. It might indicate that she's focused on things other than criminal behavior, which would be a low factor.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years and no depression in the past month. Both of these are strong indicators of good mental health and abstinence from substance abuse, which are protective factors. So this is definitely low risk.\n\nHer past living situation with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could have both pros and cons. Urban areas can offer more opportunities but might also be places where stress or higher crime rates exist. However, since she's in a supportive environment, the negative aspects are probably outweighed by the positive. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHer belief in God suggests strong moral support and perhaps a sense of direction, which could contribute to lower recidivism. This is another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Low or medium factors from her past living situation, employment, education, drug use history, and mental health. No significant high-risk factors like multiple prior convictions, substance abuse issues, or unstable family environment. Therefore, the overall risk seems low to medium.\n</think>\n\nBased on a thorough evaluation of each factor, here's the analysis:\n\n- **Age**: Low. Being 19 suggests she is in her prime years and may have more life ahead to make positive choices.\n- **Race**: Medium. While race can be a social determinant of outcome, her personal factors seem to mitigate this influence significantly.\n- **Arrest History**: Low. One non-convicted arrest indicates manageable risk without significant past legal issues.\n- **Weight**: Low. Her weight may not directly correlate with substance use, given her drug-free history and current circumstances.\n- **Marital Status/Living Arrangements**: Medium. Living alone doesn't inherently pose a high risk if supported by family, as evidenced by her living situation with her mother.\n- **Education Level**: High. College enrollment alongside a diploma suggests strong educational motivation, which is protective of recidivism.\n- **Employment**: High. Employment during the year indicates stability and focus away from criminal activities.\n- **Drug Use History**: Low. No recent drug use for four years shows consistent abstinence, contributing to reduced risk.\n- **Mental Health**: High. Absence of depression in the past month highlights good mental health, which is protective.\n- **Living Environment in Youth**: Medium. Past living with her mother in a household of five may offer support but urban settings can be stressors; however, she has strong family support now.\n\nCollectively, these factors point towards a low risk of rearrest due to her stable employment, education, and personal well-being. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 19 years old indicates she is in a prime age for positive choices and development which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence outcomes due to systemic issues, her personal factors such as education and employment suggest mitigated risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"A single non-convicted arrest suggests manageable legal risks without significant past criminal behavior affecting her current stability.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight may not directly correlate with substance abuse given her drug-free history, indicating a lower risk factor in this aspect.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to instability but her support from family mitigates potential negative influences of living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"With a diploma and college enrollment, she demonstrates a commitment to furthering her education which is typically associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding one job during the year shows stability and economic independence, reducing opportunities for criminal activity such as drug abuse or theft.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use in the past four years indicates consistent abstinence which is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Absence of depression in the past month highlights her mental well-being, which is crucial as mental health issues can often contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Environment in Youth\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with her biological mother in a household of five suggests she has had some form of supportive environment but urban settings may introduce stressors; however, her current family support mitigates this risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
