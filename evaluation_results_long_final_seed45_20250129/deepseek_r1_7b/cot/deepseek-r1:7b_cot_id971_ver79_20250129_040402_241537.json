    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They're asking for an analysis of a specific individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break down the information they provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male, White, with a single arrest and conviction. He's 5'7\" and 140 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of weight for his age. He's never married and living alone, so no domestic issues there.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, indicating some level of education but maybe not enough to get a job or support himself stably. He's held one job recently, which might show he can manage basic tasks but could struggle with unemployment lasting too long.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down in the past month. This suggests some substance abuse issues, which is concerning because substance use often correlates with other criminal behaviors or higher recidivism rates.\n\nLiving situation at a young age was with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might indicate family instability or attachment issues early on, which can affect a person's behavior and ability to reintegrate successfully after incarceration.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so he might have a more secular outlook but perhaps a lack of religious support network, which could be a risk factor for seeking help or maintaining relationships.\n\nNow, considering each of these factors:\n\n1. **Drug Use**: High - Since he's using marijuana and felt really down recently, this could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues that may lead to other problems.\n2. **Living Arrangement at Age**: Medium - Being in a household with three people might have had some issues, but it's not as severe as living with family who are violent or problematic.\n3. **Religious Beliefs**: Low - Not believing in God doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there's a lack of support system elsewhere, which isn't indicated here.\n\nThe job history and education might suggest he has some skills but could struggle without them after release, possibly leading to unemployment or new substance use triggers. His age being 21 is still relatively young, so any issues at this stage can have long-term impacts.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is the drug use, which significantly increases the likelihood of future issues. The moderate factors are living arrangement and maybe not having a strong religious network. I think overall his risk is medium because while there's one high factor, the others don't necessarily tip it over to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of drug use (marijuana) and recent feelings of low motivation, which could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues that may impact his ability to reintegrate successfully.
