    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but he's already been arrested once and convicted. Young adults often have more responsibilities and might be more motivated to change their behavior, but having a prior conviction can increase risk.\n\nHe identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk factor unless we're considering systemic issues or other demographic factors, but I don't see any information here that suggests this is an issue.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. These aren't typically risk factors related to recidivism; physical characteristics usually don't predict criminal behavior directly.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can affect stress levels, social support, which might influence recidivism. If he's not getting much support or feels isolated, that could increase risk, but it's a bit indirect.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism because more education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this might actually be protective rather than increasing risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having employment can provide income stability, reduce stress from unemployment, so having at least some steady work could be a positive factor, decreasing risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. The past use isn't as concerning as recent or frequent use, which might indicate lower current substance use. However, he feels down and sometimes can't cheer up for part of the last month. This might suggest some emotional distress or low mood, which could affect his behavior.\n\nHe lived at a young age with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Early experiences in a household of three might have had both positive and negative effects. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but also more stressors. Living with multiple people could influence his social skills or exposure to risk factors.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, indicating he doesn't practice religion. While not inherently a risk factor, it might suggest certain values or coping mechanisms that aren't directly linked to recidivism but can affect other areas of behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: His prior conviction and being young are mixed signals. The lack of marriage and living alone could be concerning for social support, which might increase stress or isolation leading to higher risk. However, his education level is positive, he's employed, and his drug use isn't severe recently. His emotional state in the past month could indicate underlying issues that need attention but may not directly correlate with recidivism unless it's tied to criminal behavior.\n\nI think the factors lean more towards low risk due to education and employment, but some elements like living alone might suggest a higher risk without direct evidence of problematic behavior. The lack of marriage can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to married individuals, which could push this up slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age is 21 years old, indicating he is still developing and may have more motivation to change behavior.
