    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, 21, with a GED. That might be considered low risk because getting a GED can sometimes indicate someone is committed to education and might seek better opportunities. But I'm not sure how race plays into it in predictive models; maybe it's more about personal circumstances than actual race.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction, which suggests some criminal history. That definitely sounds like a medium factor because past convictions are a warning sign but aren't as severe as more recent or serious offenses.\n\nHe lives alone, never married, so no family support. That could be high risk because lack of support can mean fewer resources for him to seek help or stability if he reoffs.\n\nAt 21, he's young, which is usually considered low risk since he has time to change his situation. But I'm not sure how that interacts with other factors like drug use and living alone.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana, could be medium. It's a substance abuse issue, but it might be manageable if he's making an effort now by feeling down and trying to cope. However, some drugs can lead to more serious issues if not addressed properly.\n\nHe felt so down recently that nothing could cheer him up. That suggests some level of emotional distress or low mood, which might be a medium factor because it indicates potential stressors but doesn't necessarily mean he's going to engage in risky behavior immediately.\n\nYouthful living situation at his biological mother's house with three people in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors, so that could be high risk. Also, being raised in a household without a parent might indicate some instability or neglect if not properly addressed.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with his life might point towards religious issues or spirituality. That's something to consider because lack of spiritual guidance can sometimes lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors seem to be living alone and being raised in a household without a parent, along with the urban environment. The medium factors include prior arrest, substance use, and current mood issues. Since he's young, that might counterbalance some of the high factors, but I'm not sure how significant that is.\n\nI think the overall risk is probably medium to high because despite his youth, the other factors point towards potential instability or higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. However, with proper support and intervention, maybe the risk can be managed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age is 21, which typically indicates a longer time to recidivism due to his ability to change circumstances.), (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race isn't a direct factor in predictive models, being White may not inherently correlate with higher risk compared to other groups if he has committed educational efforts.\"), (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He has a GED, which can indicate a commitment to further education and personal development.\"), (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and one conviction suggest some criminal history that could impact future behavior but aren't definitive indicators of high risk.\"), (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone, especially in an urban setting without family support, significantly increases the likelihood of unstable living conditions and potential for risky behavior.\"), (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Being single adds vulnerability to social isolation and lack of support networks which can contribute to recidivism.\"), (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past use indicates a potential for substance abuse issues, but recent efforts to cope may suggest proactive measures.\"), (\"Emotional Distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and unable to cope suggests underlying stressors that could influence behavior but doesn't necessarily predict immediate recidivism.\"), (\"Household Composition\", \"high\", \"Living with three people in an urban area without a parent indicates potential instability and exposure to higher risk environments.), (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While his belief might indicate some spirituality, the lack of engagement suggests less likelihood of direct religious influence on behavior.\"), (\"Urban Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an urban area can expose him to higher crime rates and stressors that may contribute to risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
