    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old male. I need to go through each factor carefully.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which might indicate he's relatively young, so maybe less recidivism compared to older individuals. But it also means he has fewer life experiences that could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHis race is White. From what I know, race can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, though it's often controlled for in analyses. However, without specific data showing overt discrimination, we might consider this as neutral or low impact here.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That's a minor offense history, so that would lean towards lower risk.\n\nHeight is 5'7\", weight 140 lbs. BMI-wise, he's at about 19.8, which is just below the normal weight range (BMI 20-25). Being underweight might affect his physical health, but I'm not sure if that directly impacts recidivism rates.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can reduce support networks, which might increase stress or isolation, potentially leading to higher recidivism. But at the same time, it also offers some freedom.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education is usually linked with lower recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. So that's a positive factor.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment history can be good if stable, but sometimes lack of steady work can lead to other issues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana four years ago and recently felt low mood for a month. While recent drug use might not directly cause recidivism, chronic substance abuse is a risk factor. But since it's only mentioned in the past four years, maybe the impact isn't too severe yet.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his mother in a household of three suggests he was raised in an environment where he might have had limited opportunities or exposure to more controlled environments, possibly leading to different life choices later on.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could mean he's detached from religious support systems, which can affect his decision-making and relationships, potentially increasing risk if he relies less on guidance for positive choices.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors are mixed. While education is a strong positive, other factors like living alone and limited job experience might pull the prediction towards low to medium risk but not high. However, considering his recent drug use and belief in religion, maybe it's pushing towards higher risk than I initially thought.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which might indicate a lower recidivism rate compared to older individuals with more life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"neutral\", \"His race is White.
