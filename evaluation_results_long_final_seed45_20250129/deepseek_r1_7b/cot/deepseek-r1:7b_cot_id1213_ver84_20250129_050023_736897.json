    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased reporting. So that's a medium weight.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. An acquittal might reduce the risk compared to a conviction. Maybe low weight because it's just one arrest without a conviction.\n\nHer height is 5'6\" and she weighs 190 lbs, which isn't extreme but doesn't directly relate to recidivism.\n\nLiving alone as a single parent\u2014she's never married, so that's high risk for dependency issues leading to more crimes. High weight here.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment: education is generally protective against recidivism. So low weight.\n\nOne job in the past year isn't bad, but it could indicate instability if she has had a history of unemployment. Maybe medium weight.\n\nNo recent drug use or depression suggests good mental health. That's protective, so low weight.\n\nShe was raised in a household of five in an urban area with her biological mother. That's a stressful environment that can contribute to higher recidivism rates. High weight here.\n\nLastly, she believes in God and sees His involvement in her life. Religious factors can sometimes be linked to positive behaviors or lower risk if they provide support for personal issues.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from living alone and family circumstances, medium from race, low from education and good health. So overall, the prediction is high but maybe leaning towards NO due to mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic biases that could influence recidivism risk assessments.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"One acquittal arrest may not significantly affect the risk compared to a conviction\"),\n    (\"Living Alone as Single Parent\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase dependency risks and potential for further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are generally protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year may indicate some employment instability, which could correlate with higher risk if not addressed\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use or depression suggests positive mental health indicators that mitigate risk\"),\n    (\"Upbringing in Large Household\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five in an urban area can be associated with higher stressors potentially linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God and seeing His involvement may provide positive support for personal issues, mitigating risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
