He has one prior arrest and is now convicted, but that's just once. His age being young might mean he's still developing his skills.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs\u2014nothing too extreme there. Living alone could be a factor, maybe some stress or isolation? He has a GED and is in college, which shows he's motivated to change. Only one job, so no steady income or support system yet.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before but hasn't recently. The past month he felt really down, so maybe that's affecting his mental health. Maybe he's experiencing some personal issues or stressors now.\n\nFamily background: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might have had its challenges\u2014could be related to abuse or neglect? He doesn't believe in God influencing his life, so maybe he's more self-reliant but that could also mean lack of support.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some negative factors like living alone and drug use, which can increase risk. His background might have instilled some problem-solving skills but also some vulnerabilities. His motivation from the GED and college might help him change, but time since conviction is just one year\u2014so not much time to rebuild his life.\n\nI think overall, he's on the lower end of risk because most factors are mitigating or low impact. But maybe not super low because there's still some issues like drug use and family challenges.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has a prior conviction\", \"low\", \"His conviction is recent (one time) and he has since completed it, which may indicate some self-awareness or effort to change.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"low\", \"He only used marijuana previously but hasn't in the past four years.
