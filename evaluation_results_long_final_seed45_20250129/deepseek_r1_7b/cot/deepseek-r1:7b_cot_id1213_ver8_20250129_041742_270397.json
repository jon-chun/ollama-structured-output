    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history of one arrest but it's not a conviction yet. So that might be a minor point, maybe low risk there since she hasn't been convicted.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs, which is around average for her age. Maybe not much to go on here.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could be safer in some ways but also means no support network. Not sure how that affects risk yet.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college suggests she's got education, which might help with job opportunities or avoiding further issues\u2014maybe a medium factor there.\n\nOnly one job during the year; maybe it's part-time or temporary. Job instability could increase risk if it doesn't lead to long-term solutions.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014that\u2019s a positive sign. No depression in the past month either, which is also good news.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That might have some environmental factors, maybe she's adopted or had a complex family structure. Not sure how that affects risk compared to other factors.\n\nShe has faith in God, which could be protective but not directly related to recidivism stats.\n\nPutting it all together: The one arrest is minor, education and job are positive, no drug use is good, living with her mom might have some issues but maybe she's adjusted. The main concerns are her young age and being female. She\u2019s 19, so maybe not in the peak of recidivism yet.\n\nI think overall, the risk isn't high because of her education and lack of substance abuse. Maybe a medium to low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has one non-convicted arrest, which is not a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college suggests she may have better job opportunities and stability, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job for the past year could indicate temporary employment without long-term stability, which might not be directly linked to recidivism but could suggest higher risk if unstable.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention and reduced risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, which can positively influence her ability to reintegrate into society without issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five could indicate family dynamics that might be challenging but not directly linked to recidivism without further context about the nature of these challenges.\"),\n    (\"Age and Sex\", \"low\", \"At 19 years old, she is relatively young, which is associated with lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals.
