    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the risk of a 21-year-old male reoffending within three years based on his background. Let me start by breaking down each factor given.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction. That's a red flag because having a criminal record can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think that directly affects his recidivism rate unless there are systemic issues. The information given doesn't mention anything about racial discrimination in this context, so maybe it's low to no impact here.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a factor in risk assessment; it's more about behavior and other factors. So that might be low or medium risk regarding his reoffending based on his weight alone.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which is a bit concerning because living with someone else can provide support and reduce stress. But I don't see any direct link between living situation and recidivism here, so maybe medium risk from this factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So that might be low risk.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Unemployment or having multiple jobs can affect recidivism, but since he's got one job, maybe that's a positive sign, so perhaps medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of higher recidivism because substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or increased criminal activity. That definitely should be high risk.\n\nHis early life was tough living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in an unstable environment, especially in an urban setting, can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health, increasing the risk of reoffending. So that's another high factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which might affect his motivation towards positive behaviors or seeking help, potentially leading to higher relapse rates. That would be a medium-high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history is the most concerning, followed by drug use and unstable early life. Education and having a job are mitigating factors but don't completely negate the risk. So I think overall, he's at high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Individual has one prior arrest and conviction which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior increasing future chances of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues which can lead to impulsive behaviors or substance-driven crimes.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Early Life Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area indicates exposure to potential family dysfunction and environmental stressors which can impact behavior and mental health.\"),\n    (\"Religious DisBELief\", \"medium\", \"Not believing in God may affect personal motivation towards positive behavior or seeking help, potentially leading to increased relapse rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
