    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male based on his background. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's definitely a red flag because past convictions are a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias in the justice system, which might be considered medium risk due to potential societal impacts on his treatment and outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant. Maybe if they were considering his physical capacity or something else, but not sure. So probably low impact.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Unmarried status might mean he has less support network which could affect his decision-making, so that's medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education is usually positive, but sometimes people with less formal education might have different life choices or higher stress levels. So maybe low to medium risk depending on the context.\n\nHe only held one job during the year. Unemployment for a while can affect motivation, so that's another medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana past four years and recent drug use. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor because it can lead to substance-induced problems affecting his judgment or ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHe was in a household of three at a young age in an urban area, which might suggest he's been exposed to certain environments that could have negative influences on him now. Also, living alone later might increase isolation and stress levels.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his personal life\u2014might mean he faces different emotional support sources, possibly leading to lower self-esteem or higher risk of substance abuse.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards a high risk. The recent drug use, past convictions, and living situation are strong indicators. His education might be a mitigating factor but not enough given his other issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_conviction\", \"high\", \"One arrest and one conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) and recent usage may impair judgment and increase the likelihood of substance abuse-related issues.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may affect mental health and decision-making abilities.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college suggests good educational opportunities that could positively influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employment status during the past year may indicate motivation or challenges that can contribute to risk factors if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
