    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young but also on the higher end of that range. Young adults can sometimes have more unstable situations, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nHe's White, and I know there are some disparities in the criminal justice system related to race, but since this is a predictive model, maybe we should focus on his personal factors rather than his race as an external variable.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions can increase recidivism risk. So that's probably high.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Those aren't typical red flags, so maybe no factor there.\n\nLiving alone isn't directly related to recidivism unless there are other factors like support networks, but in this case, it's just a point to note without more info.\n\nHis GED and being enrolled in college might indicate he has some education and is committed to improving his situation. That could be medium because higher education sometimes correlates with better outcomes.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year; not a lot of employment history, but maybe that's okay since it's just one job. It doesn't seem like a strong red flag either way.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can be a risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with other criminal behaviors or higher recidivism rates. That could be high.\n\nHe was young (maybe 16-20 when he lived with his mother) and it's a sensitive time where family dynamics might have changed, which could affect his behavior now. That might be medium.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life could mean he doesn't have religious support or spiritual guidance, which some studies suggest can influence recidivism rates by providing emotional support during tough times. So maybe a slight negative factor but not extremely high; perhaps medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), lack of strong family support (medium). The rest don't seem to add significant risk. So the overall risk is high, hence I'd predict YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recurrent drug use, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with higher rates of recidivism due to potential substance abuse issues and impaired judgment.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age may indicate certain family dynamics that could influence behavior but does not directly correlate with high risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has no involvement in personal life can sometimes affect mental health and substance use, which may indirectly influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
