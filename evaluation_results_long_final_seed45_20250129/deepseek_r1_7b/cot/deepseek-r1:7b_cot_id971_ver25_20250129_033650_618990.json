    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his history: he has a single arrest and one conviction. That's a clear past criminal record, which is a red flag. So that's high risk because prior convictions are strongly predictive of future offenses.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight doesn't directly indicate risk here; it's more about behavior or other factors. Maybe not as relevant, but perhaps if he was underweight or overweight, but no info on that.\n\nLiving alone: being an only child can sometimes reduce risk because there are fewer people to help him out in case of emergencies. But this is a mitigating factor compared to his arrest history.\n\nGED and college enrollment: having a GED might indicate some level of education, which is generally protective against reoffending. Similarly, attending college shows commitment, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nOnly one job in the past year: unemployment or underemployment can lead to substance abuse issues, which he has a history of using drugs, especially marijuana. But holding a job suggests responsibility.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to drug use in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential paraphernalia use or ongoing substance abuse, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nYoung age at first arrest and living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area: Living with a support system might offer stability, but the fact that he's young could mean he doesn't have life experience, which sometimes correlates with higher risk. Urban environments can also correlate with higher crime rates or stressors.\n\nNo religious affiliation: This might affect his coping mechanisms and access to support services, which can influence recidivism rates, especially if he's struggling with personal issues like low mood affecting judgment.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest history and drug use are the strongest indicators of high risk. The positive factors like education and job hold him down but aren't enough to offset his prior criminal behavior. So I'd predict a YES on rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a single prior arrest, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Admission to drug use in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues that could lead to further criminal activity or complications.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces the immediate social support available, but it does not directly correlate with higher risk without additional context about living conditions or personal circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \" possessing a GED and enrolled in college indicates some level of education and commitment to furthering his education, which is generally protective against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Young Age at First Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological parents in a household of three in an urban area may indicate potential stressors or instability that could influence recidivism risk over time but does not directly correlate with high risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"No religious affiliation may reflect personal spirituality, which can sometimes be protective against certain types of criminal behavior, especially if the individual is able to cope with life's challenges independently.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
