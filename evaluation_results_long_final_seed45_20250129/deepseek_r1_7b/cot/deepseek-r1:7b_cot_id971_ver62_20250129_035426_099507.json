    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race directly affects recidivism rates in most systems, but it's worth noting anyway.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag right there. One prior offense increases the risk compared to someone with no record.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 140 lbs. I don't think physical attributes like weight or height are typically considered in recidivism assessments unless maybe for things like substance use, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be linked to support systems, but since he's single and doesn't have a partner, it might indicate less support which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism because people are more likely to seek help or better opportunities. But here he has a GED and is enrolled, so maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unemployment can be linked to higher risk of reoffending, but holding a job even once might suggest some stability. However, if it was recent or if he's looking for another job now, it could vary.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a significant factor because substance abuse can impede progress towards better opportunities and can lead to relapse, which might result in more offenses.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Being raised in such circumstances might have emotional or behavioral issues that could contribute to recidivism, though it's not directly related to substance use. The urban setting might offer different support networks compared to rural areas.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he may not seek spiritual support, which can be a barrier to getting help if available.\n\nPutting this all together: His prior arrest and living situation aren't great, but his education and current job are positive. The drug use is concerning. Since he's young (21), maybe there's less time for him to develop better habits. Also, the urban environment might not provide the same level of support as a rural area.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think he has a medium risk of rearrest within three years because while some mitigating factors are present like education and job, several other factors like past substance use and living circumstances point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and one conviction which increases the risk of reoffending compared to those without a criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may contribute to feelings of isolation, potentially increasing substance use or other risky behaviors but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates as strongly as prior offenses or drug use.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana, and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential for relapse which could lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education and College\", \"low\", \"holding a GED and currently enrolled in college may indicate some level of stability or motivation towards positive change but does not directly correlate with lower risk as strongly as prior offenses.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job during the year could be seen as a minor setback, but the existence of employment is a mitigating factor compared to those who are unemployed or experiencing job instability.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents in an urban area may provide some support, though urban environments can also offer diverse resources which do not necessarily mitigate risk as strongly as family support might suggest.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious belief may affect access to spiritual or supportive community resources but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates as strongly as other factors like substance use or living circumstances\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
