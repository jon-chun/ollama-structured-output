    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black, which might relate to systemic issues affecting her recidivism rate compared to non-Black individuals due to historical and social factors. So that's a high relative weight.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That's probably not a big red flag since she hasn't been convicted, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; no impact on recidivism, so low weight.\n\nNot married and living alone... Hmm, living arrangements can influence support systems which might reduce risk, so perhaps lower weight. But maybe not the most significant factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education typically correlates with lower recidivism, so that's a medium or even high weight because higher education often predicts better outcomes.\n\nOnly one job in the past year... Maybe inconsistent income can affect motivation or stability, but it's not the most concerning factor here, so low to medium.\n\nDrug use and depression history are both good signs. She hasn't used drugs for four years and hasn't felt depressed recently, which are positive indicators linked to lower risk. So these factors have a high weight as they contribute positively.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with her mother in a household of five... Being raised in such conditions can sometimes lead to emotional or behavioral issues later on, but since she's managed to avoid substance abuse and not feel depressed recently, this might be less concerning now. Still, maybe medium weight because it could have long-term effects.\n\nGod involvement is a positive factor; spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so high weight here.\n\nPutting all these together: high for systemic issues (Black), medium for education, positive factors like no drug use and depression, and moderate influences from living circumstances. It seems she's at low to medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Systemic Factors - Black individual\", \"high\", \"Historically, Black individuals may face higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues such as racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

The medium weight reflects that while this is concerning, it does not necessarily guarantee recidivism without further assessment of those factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase the risk of rearrest unless there are other contributing factors such as lack of support networks or substance abuse issues. In this case, no drug use or depression history suggests a low weight factor.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Enrollment\", \"high\", \"Education is strongly correlated with lower recidivism rates.

This low weight reflects the minimal impact on recidivism given her current employment status.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression History - No Drug Use, No Depression in Past Month\", \"high\", \"A history of no drug use and no recent depression is a strong positive indicator of lower risk. These factors contribute significantly to reducing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Household Experience - Age 19 Living with Biological Mother in Household of Size 5\", \"medium\", \"While living in a household of five at a young age can have emotional and behavioral impacts, this individual has avoided substance abuse and maintained mental well-being, which mitigates some of these potential risks.
