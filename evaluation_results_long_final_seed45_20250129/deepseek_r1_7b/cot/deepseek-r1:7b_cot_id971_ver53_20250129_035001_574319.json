    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one prior conviction. That's definitely a red flag because existing convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's got a GED and is in college, which might indicate some level of education that could help him in his future job or studies, so maybe that factor is low.\n\nLiving alone suggests he doesn't have immediate family support, which could contribute to substance abuse issues as mentioned.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase criminal tendencies, so this would be a high risk factor.\n\nHis early life was marked by living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That environment might have had a negative impact on his development or mental health, contributing to his current issues.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which could affect his motivation towards positive behavior but also might mean he's not seeking help from religious sources, which are often reliable support systems for recovery.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, substance abuse, unstable early environment\u2014it seems like the risk is quite high. So, I would predict a YES to rearrest and assign a confidence level of 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years and experienced recent feelings of low mood, which can impair judgment and increase criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation and substance abuse issues, though it does not directly indicate a high risk without other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Status\", \"low\", \"The individual has a GED and is enrolled in college, which could provide opportunities for positive change or support for recovery efforts.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with an alcoholic biological mother in a household of three may have had negative effects on the individual's development that could contribute to current substance abuse issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
