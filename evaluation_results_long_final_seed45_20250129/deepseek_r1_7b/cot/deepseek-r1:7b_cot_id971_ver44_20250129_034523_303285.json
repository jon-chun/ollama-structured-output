    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let's break down all his factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because past convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism. So that's probably high risk right there.\n\nHis age is 21, which isn't too old yet, but being in college might mean he's focusing on education or career opportunities. However, his current living situation is alone, so maybe he doesn't have support from family or friends who could help him stay on track.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college, which are positive steps towards betterment. But he's only held one job during the past year. That might mean he's still figuring out his career path or possibly experiencing difficulty finding steady employment. Unemployment can lead to dependency issues and lack of motivation, so that could be medium risk.\n\nHe used drugs, specifically marijuana, in the past four years. Drug use is a major red flag because it can impair judgment, relationships, and decision-making skills. Especially since he mentioned feeling down for several months, which might contribute to him making poor choices or self-harm attempts. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can sometimes lead to emotional neglect or trauma, especially if he feels disconnected from his family. That might make him more prone to negative behaviors or substance abuse, both of which increase recidivism chances.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which suggests he's likely atheist or agnostic. This could mean a lack of spiritual support and guidance, which is another factor in maintaining positive behavior and stability.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and criminal history are high red flags. His drug use and current living situation add to the risk factors. While education and being in college are positive, his job experience is limited, which might not be enough to offset the negatives. His family background and lack of spiritual support also contribute.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'd say there's a high likelihood he'll reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and a conviction, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \" drug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana use, along with feelings of low mood, raises concerns about impaired judgment and potential self-harm behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \" living alone may lead to a lack of support network which can contribute to negative decisions or increased substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \" holding only one job during the past year and having a GED shows some commitment to education, but limited employment history might indicate instability or focus on personal circumstances rather than viable career opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \" living in a household of three with biological mother in an urban area at a young age may have contributed to emotional neglect or trauma, potentially affecting behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \" not having any religious involvement may lead to lack of spiritual guidance which could influence positive behavioral choices and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
