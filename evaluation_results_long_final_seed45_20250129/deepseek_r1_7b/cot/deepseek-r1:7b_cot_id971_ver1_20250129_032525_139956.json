    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this guy who's a 21-year-old male. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race plays a huge role here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him specifically. But since it's just mentioned, maybe it's not a high factor yet.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That's minimal, so I'd say low risk from that on its own.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. I don't see how physical characteristics contribute to recidivism unless there's something about his behavior tied to his weight or health, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but since he's young, maybe it's not a high risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so that might be low risk.\n\nHe worked one job last year. Even though working helps, having only one job at 21 seems possible but doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there were issues with the job or stability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can affect mental health, which might lead to more substance abuse issues, so that's a medium factor.\n\nYoung age of living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Young households might have less support or different dynamics, possibly leading to higher stress, making him a medium risk.\n\nBelieving God has nothing to do with his life could lead to existential issues or lack of motivation, increasing risk slightly\u2014so medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The main factors that stand out are past drug use (medium) and young age living situation (medium). The rest seem low. Combining these might make the overall prediction a bit higher than just low but not high enough for a strong risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which may have minimal impact on recidivism unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him specifically.
