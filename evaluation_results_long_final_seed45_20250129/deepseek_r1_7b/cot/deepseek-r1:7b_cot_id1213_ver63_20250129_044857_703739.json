    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I remember that there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can affect people of color more often than others. This might mean she has access to worse resources or experiences that could increase her chances of recidivism.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. Since it's a non-conviction, maybe she's facing some barriers like probation or community service instead of incarceration. Non-convicted arrests can sometimes lead to lower risk compared to convictions, but if the circumstances are harsh, it might still be significant.\n\nHer height is 5'6\", weight 190 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is unless there's something about her body type linked to recidivism, which I don't think is a common factor. Probably low risk here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can reduce social support, which might lower her risk since she has no one to look out for her. But if she's unstable, it could be high risk\u2014though in this case, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma with college enrollment. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because people are more likely to get jobs and support themselves. So that's probably low risk.\n\nShe held one job last year. That's a positive sign; having employment can reduce substance abuse, criminal behavior, etc. So low risk here too.\n\nNo drug use in past four years. That's great\u2014substance abuse is a big contributor to recidivism. No recent drug use would be medium risk unless she's doing something else illegal.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed for a month. Lack of depression might mean she's mentally stable, which reduces risk. So low here as well.\n\nAt young age, lived in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area. High family size can lead to stress or neglect issues. Urban areas might have different dynamics compared to rural areas, but the fact that it's a household of five is concerning and could increase risk factors like instability or abuse. So this factor might be high.\n\nShe believes in God, which is generally associated with stability and lower recidivism rates. So maybe low here.\n\nPutting all together: non-convicted arrest (medium), living alone with no recent issues (low?), but the family environment (high). The education and job are good, so maybe the overall risk is medium? But considering the high factor from her family, it might tip towards high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Non-convicted Arrest\", \"medium\", \"A non-convicted arrest can sometimes lead to harsher conditions compared to a conviction and may indicate systemic issues affecting her risk profile.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces social support, which lowers risk unless there are signs of instability.
