    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 21-year-old male with several factors that could influence his recidivism risk over the next three years.\n\nFirst, let me break down each factor step by step. He's White, which might suggest some systemic issues but I don't have specific data on how race affects recidivism here. Since he's been arrested once and convicted, that's a significant red flag. Recidivism rates for those with criminal history are typically higher.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant to risk assessment, so maybe I can ignore that unless there's a specific reason related to behavior, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. While living arrangements can sometimes correlate with substance use or isolation leading to more negative behaviors, again, not a direct indicator of recidivism without more context.\n\nHis GED and college enrollment are positive factors in terms of education potentially leading to better opportunities, which might lower his risk compared to someone with less education. However, if he's not completing his education, that could be a concern too.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, so he has some work experience but maybe limited income stability or job satisfaction, which could affect his motivation or ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nDrug use history is significant here; he used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and may contribute to antisocial behavior, all of which are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age could indicate exposure to family dynamics or environment that might have influenced his behavior. The fact that he doesn't believe in God suggests he might be more inclined towards secular values, but I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together: His past criminal history is a high risk factor because of the established pattern of behavior. Drug use and recent negative mood are also strong indicators pointing to higher likelihood of relapse or new offenses. The other factors like education and living situation don't seem to directly contribute enough to tip the balance in his favor.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would assign high risk factors for each relevant aspect: past convictions, drug use, and maybe others if applicable. This leads me to predict a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_convictions\", \"high\", \"His history of arrest and conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"negative_mood\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down or negative affects judgment and may lead to impulsive behavior which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of three in an urban area at a young age may have contributed to behavioral patterns that could influence future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college may indicate a desire for better opportunities, which could reduce risk compared to those without such resources.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
