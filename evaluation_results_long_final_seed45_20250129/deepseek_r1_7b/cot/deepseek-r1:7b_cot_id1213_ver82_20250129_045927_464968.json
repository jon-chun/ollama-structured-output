    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 19-year-old female. I need to go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is Black. I remember that racial disparities in the criminal justice system can affect risk assessments. There might be systemic factors at play here that could influence her chances of rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Since it's a minor offense, this might have less weight than a more serious conviction. However, even a non-convicted arrest could indicate some underlying issues she needs to address.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here unless there's medical history involved, which isn't mentioned, so I'll ignore those for now.\n\nLiving alone is a risk factor because isolation can lead to emotional stress or substance abuse. She's single and doesn't have support, which might contribute to her behavior issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is in college. College attendance often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates, so this should be a mitigating factor.\n\nHolding one job during the year suggests some stability, though it could also mean limited opportunities for upward mobility if she's not progressing in her career.\n\nNo recent drug use is positive\u2014it shows she's been clean, which can prevent relapse. Not feeling depressed over the past month is another pro-social behavior, indicating good mental health.\n\nShe was a child in a household of five living with her biological mother. That suggests she experienced a lot of stress and possibly neglect, which could have long-term effects on her behavior and stability as an adult.\n\nConsidering that God has some influence indicates she's involved in a religion or spiritual practice, which can be protective against recidivism by promoting self-discipline and community support.\n\nPutting it all together: The non-convicted arrest is low risk because it's minor. Living alone and lack of substance abuse are medium factors. College attendance is high positive. Job holding isn't a strong mitigant but not low either. No drugs or depression suggest good current health, which is medium. The past household environment is low due to potential trauma, and her spiritual involvement is high as it's protective.\n\nSo overall, I'd rate the risk as low. She has several positive factors that should help keep her out of trouble.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Racial background can influence recidivism risk due to systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"Minor Non-Convicted Arrest\", \"low\", \"A single non-convicted arrest may not be a significant factor without prior history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and potential substance abuse issues, which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Attendance\", \"high\", \"Education is strongly associated with lower recidivism rates as it provides opportunities for better job prospects and community support.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Having a job can be a mitigating factor, but one job during the year may not provide enough stability or upward mobility opportunity.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, and this absence indicates better self-discipline.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues are significant risk factors, but not experiencing depression alone does not guarantee stability.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Household Environment (Household of 5)\", \"low\", \"Experiencing stress from a large household can lead to behavioral issues that may persist into adulthood.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Involvement\", \"high\", \"Religious involvement is often associated with higher self-discipline and community support, which are protective factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
