    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Young adults are often less likely to repeat their mistakes compared to older individuals who might be more established in society or have different life experiences. So that probably puts him on the lower end of risk factors.\n\nNext, race: he identifies as White. Generally, racial factors can play a role in recidivism rates due to systemic issues like policing and socioeconomic disparities. But without specific data linking his race directly to higher rearrest rates, it's hard to assign a significant weight here. Maybe medium low or negligible.\n\nConvictions: he has one. One conviction is enough for a felony if it's serious, but since the details don't specify the nature of the offense, I'm not sure how much that affects his risk compared to someone with multiple convictions. However, having any conviction does add some risk, so maybe low.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Marijuana is generally less habit-forming than harder drugs but can still lead to other substance use issues. This might indicate potential for more substance abuse, which could influence his risk if it affects his job or social life. Maybe medium low.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which the individual mentioned\u2014they felt down recently. Social support is a key factor in recidivism; without it, he might be more likely to fall into criminal behavior again. So this could increase his risk.\n\nEducation level: he has a GED and is in college. Having some education can help with job opportunities and overall stability, which should lower the risk. Maybe medium low or even negligible if other factors are strong.\n\nEmployment: he's been working one job during the year. Employment provides income and stability, which generally reduces recidivism risk. So this factor doesn't contribute much to high risk.\n\nNumber of previous jobs: just one. That's not a lot of work history, so probably no significant risk here.\n\nLiving situation: alone in an urban area with his biological mother when young. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and different social dynamics. Living with a parent might provide stability but could also create dependency if he relies too much on them for help or support. The fact that he considers God unrelated to his personal life adds some risk, perhaps because of underlying mental health issues.\n\nMood swings: he's felt down recently. Mood disorders can make substance use more likely and contribute to risky behavior. This is a medium high factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAge (21) \u2013 Low risk\nRace (White) \u2013 Negligible\nConvictions (1) \u2013 Low\nDrug use (marijuana, recent feelings of downness) \u2013 Medium low\nMarital status (single living alone) \u2013 Medium high\nEducation (GED in college) \u2013 Negligible or medium low\nEmployment (one job) \u2013 Low\nNumber of jobs (1) \u2013 Low\nLiving situation (urban, young age with mom) \u2013 Medium high\nMood swings (recent feelings of downness) \u2013 Medium high\n\nSo the most significant risk factors seem to be his living alone in an urban area and recent mood issues. The mood swings are a strong indicator because it suggests he might be dealing with mental health issues that could lead to more risky behavior.\n\nConsidering all these, I would assign a higher relative weight to mood swings and living situation as high, and drug use as medium low. His age doesn't contribute much, so maybe negligible or low for the overall risk factors.\n\nWait, but in my initial assessment, mood swings were Medium High because it's directly linked to substance use. Living alone is also Medium High because of isolation. The other factors like race are negligible, so they don't add much weight.\n\nSo when I look at all these together, his risk seems higher than average due to the mood swings and living situation. Therefore, my prediction would lean towards YES for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Low\", \"Young adults are often less likely to repeat their mistakes compared to older individuals who might be more established in society or have different life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"Negligible\", \"Racial factors can play a role, but without specific data linking his race directly to higher rearrest rates, it's hard to assign significant weight here.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"Low\", \"Having any conviction does add some risk compared to someone with multiple convictions, but the nature of the offense isn't specified.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (marijuana)\", \"Medium Low\", \"Marijuana use can still lead to other substance abuse issues which might affect job or social life.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"Medium High\", \"Living alone in an urban area with biological mother at a young age, combined with feelings of isolation, can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Education (GED in College)\", \"Negligible\", \"Some education helps with job opportunities and stability, which should lower the risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment (One Job During the Year)\", \"Low\", \"Employment provides income and stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Previous Jobs\", \"Low\", \"Just one job doesn't contribute significantly to high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation in Urban Area\", \"Medium High\", \"Urban environments can have higher crime rates and different social dynamics, contributing to dependency issues.\"),\n    (\"Mood Swings (Recent Feelings of Downness)\", \"Medium High\", \"Mood disorders linked to substance use and risky behavior make this a significant factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
