    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, racial disparities in the criminal justice system exist, but at this point, maybe it doesn't directly influence his risk unless there are systemic issues to consider. Since he has a GED and is in college, that might indicate better educational opportunities which could help him get ahead.\n\nHe's been convicted once, which is significant because prior convictions increase the risk of recidivism. But since it's only one conviction, maybe the weight isn't too high yet. He's currently living alone, which can be a double-edged sword\u2014being alone might offer some stability but could also mean he doesn't have support when things go wrong.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can definitely impact his ability to reintegrate into society and maintain stable relationships. It's concerning that it happened both in the past and now, so this factor might be high or at least medium.\n\nHe was a single parent from a young age in an urban area. Living with two other family members could provide some support, but being raised by God doesn't align with common religious views on support systems, which might affect his relationships and ability to cop out of problems.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life is interesting. This might influence his motivation towards positive change or seeking help, as he's likely looking for other avenues beyond religion for dealing with issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior conviction (medium), living alone (low maybe?), drug use (high), and family background (low). The high factor here is the drug use, which significantly increases risk. So even though other factors are somewhat mitigating, the high from drug use might push the overall prediction to YES with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which moderately increases recidivism risk but is not the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may offer some stability but does not inherently increase risk compared to others in similar situations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy drug use, particularly marijuana, significantly increases the risk of rearrest as it affects mental and physical health, impeding reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with a household of three from a young age may provide some support but does not inherently decrease risk compared to other family structures in similar situations.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
