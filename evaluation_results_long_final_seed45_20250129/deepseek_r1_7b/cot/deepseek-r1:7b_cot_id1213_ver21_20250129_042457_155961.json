    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black and has a high school diploma but isn't convicted yet. I know there are systemic issues that can affect recidivism rates based on race, so that might be a low to medium risk factor because of the potential for systemic barriers.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs, which is within a healthy range, so no weight-related risk here.\n\nNot being married or living alone\u2014since she's young, maybe she's still exploring her options. I don't see a high risk from this factor.\n\nHaving held one job during the year seems stable, but if it was in a low-paying industry, that could be concerning. However, without more info, I'll consider it medium risk because employment status is positive but not directly tied to recidivism unless it's unstable work.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression\u2014very positive indicators with low risk here.\n\nShe lived in a household of five at a young age, which might indicate she was in an environment without support. That could be high risk because early neglect or abuse is a serious factor.\n\nConsidering her religious belief as a protective factor, it's low to medium.\n\nPutting all together: the living situation in a large household seems like a strong risk indicator. The rest are positive but don't outweigh that. So overall prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Education\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma, which is typically associated with better job prospects and lower recidivism risk compared to those without education.\"),\n    (\"Race and Systemic Factors\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in recidivism, there are systemic barriers that might mitigate her increased risk compared to similar individuals of other races.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job during the year suggests stable employment, which is generally protective but not without concern if the job was unstable or low-paying.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone at a young age in a household of five could indicate potential neglect or abuse, which are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Health and Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression suggest good health and mental well-being, reducing her risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God may provide a sense of direction or moral support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
