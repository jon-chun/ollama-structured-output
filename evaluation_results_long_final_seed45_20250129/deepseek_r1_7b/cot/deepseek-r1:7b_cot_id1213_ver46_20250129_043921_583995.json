    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know there are systemic issues in the justice system that can affect re-arrest rates, so that might lean towards a higher risk.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. If it was a minor offense, maybe her risk is lower, but I don't have more details on the nature of the arrest.\n\nAge 19 is young, which usually correlates with lower recidivism because she's still developing. But age alone doesn't determine everything.\n\nHer height and weight probably aren't factors here; they're just physical attributes.\n\nSingle living situation could mean less support network, increasing risk a bit.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment: Higher education often leads to better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so maybe this lowers her risk.\n\nOne job in the past year suggests she's employed and possibly stable financially, which is good for not getting arrested again.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression in a month are positive signs; substance abuse and mental health issues can contribute to re-arrest.\n\nShe was living with her biological mother in a household of five. This close family support might have protective effects against negative influences.\n\nHer religious belief is stated, but I don't know how it affects her personal behavior or risk factors.\n\nPutting all together: Despite some positive signs like education and job stability, the lack of conviction for a minor offense, being Black, living alone, and maybe past unstable family environment could increase her risk. So, overall, I'm leaning towards high relative risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but no conviction, which may indicate a minor offense.
