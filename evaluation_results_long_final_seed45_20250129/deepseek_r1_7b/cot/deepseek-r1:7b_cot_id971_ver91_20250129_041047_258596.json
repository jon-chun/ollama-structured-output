    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for a 21-year-old male and predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. Generally, racial factors can influence recidivism rates due to historical and systemic issues, but at 21, it's more about personal circumstances than systemic biases. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor\u2014medium-high because past convictions directly correlate with higher chances of reoffending.\n\nAge is 21, which is relatively young, but considering he's already been convicted once, his recidivism might still be possible in the next three years. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he has a GED and is college enrolled, he's actively trying to improve, which might mitigate some risk\u2014maybe low or medium.\n\nNo family living with him except his biological mother in an urban area when young. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and poorer environments, so that could increase risk\u2014medium-high.\n\nHe identifies as Godless; this could affect his motivation towards positive values like community involvement or personal growth, which might increase recidivism risk\u2014high because he lacks support and motivation for positive behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but only recently felt down. Drug use can be a sign of potential substance abuse issues, which is a risk factor\u2014medium-high.\n\nHis job history\u2014he held one job during the year. Employment stability can reduce recidivism; having at least one job shows he's capable and perhaps more likely to find another if released\u2014so maybe low or medium.\n\nHe feels down often but isn't necessarily indicative of substance abuse beyond marijuana unless it's leading to significant issues. The sentiment might not directly correlate with recidivism\u2014maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: his past convictions, age, living situation, lack of family support, and Godlessness are strong factors. Drug use could also add to the risk. So overall, he seems high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial background can influence recidivism rates due to historical and systemic factors, but at this young age, it's more about personal circumstances than societal biases.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium-high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending in the next three years.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age is relatively young, but past convictions still pose a significant risk of recidivism within this timeframe.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without family support may reduce some risk factors, as he has a GED and is enrolled in college which could provide motivation for positive change.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium-high\", \"Exposure to a high-crime urban area with limited family support increases the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking alternative environments that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"high\", \"Godlessness and lack of religious support can reduce motivation for positive behavior, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending by leading to disengagement from societal norms and support systems.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium-high\", \"Drug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, could indicate potential substance abuse issues that may contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment history shows he has the capability to work and may find gainful employment upon release, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mood_state\", \"low\", \"Feeling down occasionally might not directly correlate with substance abuse unless it leads to significant issues, but this could indicate lower motivation for positive behavior.\"),\n    (\"family Environment\", \"medium-high\", \"Living in a household of three in an urban area may expose him to environments conducive to negative influences and higher crime rates, increasing risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
