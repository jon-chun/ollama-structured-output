    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 19-year-old female, Black individual who has been arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'6\", weighs 190 lbs, living alone, with a high school diploma and enrolled in college, working one job, no drug use in the past four years, not depressed recently, lived in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19, which is quite young. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing skills and life experiences. But since she was arrested once, that could indicate some issues early on, but not necessarily a high risk now.\n\nEthnicity: Black individuals sometimes face different treatment in the justice system, potentially leading to more harsh sentences or disparities, which might affect her re-arrest chances. However, without specific data showing systemic issues affecting this case directly, it's probably moderate.\n\nPrior arrest: one non-convicted arrest. Non-convicted means she didn't face any severe penalties, so that's a positive sign. If she had a conviction, especially for serious crimes, the risk might be higher. But since it's a minor offense, her prior is low to medium risk.\n\nPhysical characteristics: 5'6\" and 190 lbs aren't red flags unless there's an issue with weight management or substance abuse, but she hasn't used drugs in four years. So that factor is probably low.\n\nLiving alone: living independently can lead to better decision-making and lower risk of recidivism compared to sharing a home where someone might influence her negatively. So this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma and attending college shows she's pursuing further education, which is usually protective against reoffending. College attendance often correlates with higher self-esteem and better life choices, so this is likely low risk.\n\nEmployment: working one job during the year suggests stability, as unemployment can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Employment in a stable job could lower recidivism rates, making this factor medium but probably not high.\n\nNo drug use for four years: that's a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a major driver of recidivism, so not using drugs significantly reduces the risk here.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently: depression can be a motivator for criminal behavior, especially when it's untreated or chronic. Since she's not experiencing depression now, this factor supports low to medium risk.\n\nHousehold size and living conditions: she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban areas might have different crime rates or social dynamics, but since she's living with family, that support reduces risk compared to living alone without supervision. This is probably a mitigating factor, so low to medium.\n\nReligion: believing in God can sometimes be seen as a protective factor if it provides moral guidance and helps in decision-making. However, this is subjective and varies widely among individuals, so its impact might be lower.\n\nPutting all these together:\n\nAge - moderate risk because she's young but has some mitigating factors.\nEthnicity - low to medium due to potential systemic issues without specific evidence of them affecting this case.\nPrior arrest - low since it was non-convicted.\nPhysical characteristics - low, no drug use.\nLiving alone - medium? Wait, living alone is usually protective, so maybe lower than medium. But considering she's young and had a prior arrest, perhaps medium.\nEducation - high school diploma and college - very low risk.\nEmployment - one job - medium but not high.\nNo drug use - low.\nNot depressed - medium because depression could be a cause of recidivism if present, but she isn't feeling it now.\nHousehold size in urban area - mitigating factor, maybe low to medium.\nBelief in God - subjective, so lower.\n\nSo combining these, the overall risk would lean towards medium. The factors that increase risk are her age and prior arrest, while most others are protective. Since she's young but had a minor offense, it could balance out between medium and high, leaning more towards medium because the other factors strongly mitigate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults often have lower recidivism rates due to skill development, though this individual's age of 19 may influence risk assessment given potential developmental stages and past issues.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"While Black ethnicity can sometimes be associated with systemic disparities, there is no specific evidence indicating direct impact on re-arrest in this case.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"low\", \"Non-convicted prior arrest suggests minimal immediate risk; however, recidivism rates can vary based on the nature and severity of the offense, which isn't specified here.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years indicates good health management, contributing to lower risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if influenced negatively, but in this case, it is mitigated by independent living and positive life choices.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment strongly indicate proactive seeking of higher education, reducing reoffending tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job during the year suggests stability, though occasional unemployment can still pose risks depending on surrounding circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years indicates good sobriety and self-discipline, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently reduces the risk of criminal behavior motivated by untreated mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size/Living Conditions\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five provides support, mitigating some risk factors but not eliminating them entirely.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low\", \"While belief in God can offer moral guidance, its impact varies widely and is subjective without specific evidence of influence on this individual's behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
