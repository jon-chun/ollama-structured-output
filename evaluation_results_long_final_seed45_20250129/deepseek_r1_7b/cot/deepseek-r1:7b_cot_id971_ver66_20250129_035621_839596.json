    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is quite young. Young adults often have less life experience, which might mean they're still developing their skills and relationships. This could be a low to medium risk factor because they might not have the same level of stability as older individuals.\n\nHe's identified as White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing or socioeconomic disparities within communities, but since he has only one prior arrest and is in college, these factors might be mitigated here. So maybe this factor isn't a strong risk indicator for him.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. While his weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are health issues involved, which aren't mentioned here. So probably no significant effect on the risk assessment related to rearrest.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, but it also allows him more flexibility in managing his time and responsibilities. This might not be a high-risk factor unless there are specific issues with social support or routine.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having a GED can sometimes provide educational opportunities that might help with job prospects or personal development. Similarly, attending college could indicate a desire to improve himself, which usually reduces risk. So this seems like a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Job experience is generally positive for recidivism because having work can provide stability and financial independence. One job might be manageable and shows he has some capability to handle responsibilities beyond just being an adult.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years, which isn't severe. However, even light drug use can have negative consequences on mental health or relationships. It's a medium risk factor because it indicates possible substance abuse issues that could affect his ability to manage daily life effectively.\n\nHis mood: He felt down and couldn't find comfort during the past month. This could be related to substance use but might also suggest other underlying issues like depression or anxiety. Without further information, this is a medium concern as it could impact his ability to function normally and make positive decisions.\n\nEarly life living situation: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher stress levels due to crime, noise, etc., but also offer opportunities for education and employment. The size of the household might indicate family support, which is positive. However, being in an urban area could introduce challenges that might affect his stability later on.\n\nHe believes God has no influence over his life. This lack of religious belief can sometimes lead to a loss of structure or guidance, especially if he's surrounded by supportive family or peers. It might contribute to lower self-direction but also higher potential for self-reliance as he becomes more mature. Not sure how strong this is as a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The negative factors seem to be medium (substance use and mood) while the positives are low/medium (GED, education, job). Without more info on his mental health or substance use beyond the past month, I'll lean towards low risk but not certain. Maybe 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults often have less life experience, which might mean they're still developing their skills and relationships, potentially lowering risk.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, this individual's one prior arrest and college enrollment mitigate potential disparities.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism unless health issues are present, which aren't mentioned here.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone allows more flexibility in managing time and responsibilities, reducing risk factors related to isolation.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED provides educational opportunities that can lead to better job prospects or personal development, indicating lower risk.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year shows some capability to manage responsibilities beyond adulthood, contributing to stability.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Light marijuana use could have negative consequences on mental health or relationships, indicating a medium risk factor.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Mood/Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down without comfort could suggest potential issues with mental well-being affecting daily life effectiveness.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Early Life Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area with family support can offer opportunities but may also introduce challenges, though the household size indicates some family stability.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God can provide structure and guidance, contributing to self-direction and reducing potential for lack of structure.\",\n     \"low\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
