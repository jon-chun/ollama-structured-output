    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's got a high school diploma but is in college. That usually means better job opportunities, which might reduce her chances of reoffending. But since she's only been arrested once and not convicted, maybe she's motivated to change her behavior now.\n\nHer age is 19; younger individuals sometimes have more flexibility and time to find a way out. Her living situation alone could mean she has fewer distractions or opportunities to stay engaged in criminal activities. Plus, she hasn't used drugs in four years, which shows responsibility.\n\nNot feeling depressed for a month might indicate stability, which is positive. She's in college, so maybe focusing on academics can lead to better job prospects and less involvement in the criminal system.\n\nShe comes from a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area. That might have provided some support but could also mean higher stress or lack of supervision if she felt abandoned as a child. However, she acknowledges God's influence, which is a strong positive factor for moral guidance and resilience.\n\nConsidering all these factors: no prior convictions, stable living situation, education, drug-free record, recent positive emotional state, and a supportive but possibly challenging upbringing. These seem to lean towards lower risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has one non-convicted arrest\", \"low\", \"Her single non-convicted arrest may indicate ongoing motivation or lack thereof, reducing recidivism risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Age 19\", \"low\", \"Youth often have more time and flexibility to change behaviors, potentially decreasing rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can provide some independence, which might reduce opportunities for criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma in college\", \"medium\", \"While education is a positive factor, being in college may indicate potential for better job prospects reducing recidivism risk, but not eliminating it entirely.\"),\n    (\"Drug-free record (4 years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests a stable lifestyle and lower risk of engaging in criminal activities related to drugs.\"),\n    (\"Not depressed in last month\", \"low\", \"Stable emotional state can contribute to better decision-making and reduced tendency towards recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size 5 with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"A larger household could imply less supervision if she feels abandoned, but her acknowledgment of God's influence suggests strong moral support which might mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Fresh from college\", \"low\", \"Recent education can provide skills and opportunities that may lead to positive life choices and job stability reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
