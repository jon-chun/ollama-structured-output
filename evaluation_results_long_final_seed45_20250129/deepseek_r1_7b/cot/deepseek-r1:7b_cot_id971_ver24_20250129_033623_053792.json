    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which might be a positive indicator because younger individuals often have more time to change their lives. But he's been convicted once, so that's a negative sign on the risk side.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which suggests he's committed to improving himself educationally. That's a good sign for low risk. However, he's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can impact recidivism rates, but since it's only once per year, maybe the effect isn't too severe yet.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher or lower risk, but being single might mean he's focused on education or career instead of other factors like family support.\n\nConsidering his past living situation, at a young age he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting might have contributed to some behavioral issues without much supervision, which could increase risk.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life is a strong indicator of potential paraphilia or other paraphilic disorders, which are known predictors of recidivism. That's a high-risk factor.\n\nHe felt down and couldn't find comfort for about a month recently, which might point towards some mental health issues like depression. Depression can be a precursor to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like being convicted, past drug use, living alone, family history, and his mindset toward religion and mood contribute to higher risk. While education is positive, the negatives outweigh it, leading to a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age (21 years) might indicate more time for change but could also be associated with lower recidivism rates.
