    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female and predict her rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history but it's expunged, so no active criminal record. That\u2019s usually a positive sign because it shows she\u2019s managed her past behavior well.\n\nShe identifies as Black, which is an underrepresented group in recidivism studies. There might be systemic issues or biases that could affect her chances, even though she's otherwise clean.\n\nHer age is 19, which means she's likely still in school or working entry-level jobs. Young adults often have more options and less substance use compared to older individuals.\n\nShe\u2019s 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Her BMI isn't calculated here, but weight can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors like drug use, though she hasn\u2019t used drugs in the past four years. So that's a good sign.\n\nLiving alone is safer than living with others who might not support her or introduce risky behaviors. No partner means fewer social influences that could lead to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college. Education typically reduces recidivism because it offers better opportunities. Plus, she\u2019s only one job, which suggests she's relatively stable economically.\n\nHer lack of drug use in the past four years and no recent depression indicates good mental health, which can prevent self-harm or other risky behaviors that might lead to reoffending.\n\nShe lived in a household of five at a young age. Shared living can sometimes be stressful, but without knowing more about her experiences there, it's hard to say if that led to negative outcomes. However, she\u2019s now living alone, which is better for her stability.\n\nHer belief in God suggests strong moral values and support from family or religion, which could contribute to positive behavior change.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors don't seem to point towards a high risk of rearrest. She's clean, has good mental health, stable economically and socially, educationally advanced, and living independently. Her past living situation might be a concern, but her current circumstances are strong indicators of low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19 years old, indicating she is likely in school or working entry-level jobs, which can provide stability and fewer opportunities for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years, reducing the risk of substance abuse, which is a known factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental health and reduced risk of self-harm or risky behaviors that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, providing opportunities for better future outcomes and reducing educational barriers that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"She is currently living alone after being single for the year, which offers stability and fewer social influences that could lead to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"She lived in a household of five at a young age but is now living alone, which may reduce some of the potential stressors associated with shared living without knowing more about her past experiences.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, indicating strong moral values and support from her faith, which could contribute to positive behavior change and reduced risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
