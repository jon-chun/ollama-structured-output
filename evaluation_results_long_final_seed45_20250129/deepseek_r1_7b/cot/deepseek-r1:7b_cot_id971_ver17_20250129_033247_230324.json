    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male returning to prison within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young, so maybe a bit of caution here. He has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction, which immediately raises concerns. His GED might mean he could be looking for stable employment, but he's also in college, so perhaps that's a positive sign.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone \u2013 that's a neutral factor unless there are issues related to living arrangements. He has some education and is pursuing higher learning, which usually helps with job prospects and stability.\n\nOnly one job in the past year might indicate inconsistency, but it could also mean he's actively seeking employment. Using drugs in the past four years shows substance abuse; that's a significant risk factor because drug use can impede reintegration into society.\n\nHe feels down often and had bad mood during the last month \u2013 this suggests possible mental health issues or stressors affecting his well-being, which could influence his behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area might have shaped his character but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to assess. His lack of faith in God is something that might affect his motivation towards positive change but also shows he's comfortable with his own identity and independent.\n\nPutting all this together: He has a clear criminal history, substance abuse, negative mood, which are strong indicators of potential relapse. The other factors don't outweigh these risks. So, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age is 21 years old, which may indicate he is still developing and less likely to have significant future issues but could also be seen as a potential risk factor if he has not integrated well into society.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"He has one prior arrest and a conviction, which indicates a history of criminal behavior that could correlate with higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"He has a GED and is enrolled in college, which may suggest he is committed to furthering his education but does not necessarily guarantee stable employment or reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"He has held one job during the past year; while this could be seen as a positive factor due to active seeking of employment, it also may indicate inconsistent work history which might affect reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used drugs in the past four years and felt extremely down during the last month.
