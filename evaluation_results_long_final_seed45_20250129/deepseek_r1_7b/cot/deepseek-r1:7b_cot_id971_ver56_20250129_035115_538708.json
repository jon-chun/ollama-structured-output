    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the risk factors for this person. He's a 21-year-old male with a White background. He has one arrest and one conviction, which is pretty low, so maybe that doesn't contribute much. His weight and height don't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which might indicate some social instability. But I'm not sure how that translates to recidivism risk. He has a GED and is in college, which are positive factors because education can help with job opportunities.\n\nOnly one job in the past year\u2014maybe that's unstable? Not sure if that's high or low. Drug use history from four years ago but recent use this month. That could be concerning for recidivism.\n\nHe was raised in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban area, which might suggest some challenges at home. His belief that God has nothing to do with his life is interesting\u2014could indicate lack of motivation or hope, maybe leading him back to similar behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, I think he's on the lower end but still has some risk factors. Maybe medium risk because of past substance use and living situation.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor:\n\n- **Drug Use History**: Medium - The individual has a history of drug use in the past four years, which could indicate potential relapse or increased substance abuse behavior.\n\n- **Living Situation**: Low - Living alone with no dependents may suggest some degree of independence but also potential social isolation.\n\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Low - A lack of religious involvement might correlate with lower motivation for positive behaviors and higher risk of reverting to previous patterns.\n\n**Prediction**: NO  \n**Confidence**: 30%  \n\nThe individual has a low confidence level in predicting rearrest because the factors considered, while present, do not strongly indicate high risk. However, the combination of living alone and recent drug use suggests moderate risk rather than high or low. The final prediction is based on the balance of these factors, leading to a relatively low confidence score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of marijuana use in the past four years and recent drug use this month, which could indicate potential relapse or increased substance abuse behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no dependents may suggest some degree of independence but also potential social isolation which might not be directly correlated to high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens in his life, this could indicate a lack of motivation or support which might correlate with lower levels of positive behavior and higher risk of reverting to previous patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
