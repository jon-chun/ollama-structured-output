    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. I know that being arrested is a red flag because it shows she's faced legal issues before. But since it's not a conviction, maybe the weight isn't as high? Maybe medium?\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. That doesn't immediately seem like a risk factor, but maybe her weight could relate to something else. I don't think height or weight alone predict recidivism much, so probably low impact.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Single living can be associated with higher crime rates because she might not have support if things go wrong, which could increase risk. So that's a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment: Education is generally linked to lower recidivism because people with more education are more likely to get jobs or make better decisions. So this would be low risk.\n\nOnly one job in the past year might mean she's not very stable, which could lead to unemployment issues contributing to recidivism. That sounds like a medium factor.\n\nNo drug use and no recent depression: These are positive indicators because substance abuse and mental health issues can be big contributors. So this is probably low risk.\n\nYoung age at home: She lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Young people might not have the life skills, and urban areas could have higher crime rates. This sounds like a medium factor since it's a sensitive situation but maybe not as severe as other factors.\n\nBelieving in God: This is about her spirituality or religion. I don't think this affects recidivism much; maybe some cultural factors, but generally, it's neutral. So low impact here.\n\nPutting it all together: The high school diploma and living alone are positive signs. The arrest isn't a conviction, so maybe that medium factor doesn't drag the prediction down too much. The job status is only one, which might not be enough to predict recidivism. The rest seem neutral or positive except for the urban environment where she lived as a minor.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk overall because of her education and stable living situation. Maybe some medium factors are present but not strong enough to tip it into high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record (Not Convicted)\", \"medium\", \"Having an arrest record, even without a conviction, can indicate potential for future criminal behavior and should be considered in the risk assessment.
