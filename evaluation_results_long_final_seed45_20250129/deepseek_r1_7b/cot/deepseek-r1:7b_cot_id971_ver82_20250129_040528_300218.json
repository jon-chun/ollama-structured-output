    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. From what I remember, race can influence recidivism rates because of things like systemic inequality and access to resources. But since he has a GED and is in college, that might mitigate some of those effects. Plus, he's only been arrested once and convicted, so maybe his background isn't as concerning.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Not sure if height or weight directly affects recidivism risk. Maybe it's more about other factors like substance use or living situation.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to substance abuse issues or self-harm. That could increase the risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism because it provides alternative opportunities. So that's a positive factor reducing risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Unstable employment can lead to financial strain, dependency on substance use for survival, or lack of skills development. That might raise his risk.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse issues are a big risk factor because it can impair judgment, increase recidivism rates itself, and lead to other risky behaviors like self-harm.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Co-residing with the biological mother might suggest some form of attachment or family issues that could contribute to substance abuse or emotional problems later on.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he's not religious, which can affect how he copes with stress and manages substance use. Some people turn to religion for support when they're struggling, so this might be a void that needs filling.\n\nPutting it all together: His arrest history is minimal but includes a conviction, which could impact future opportunities. His substance use history, both past and recent feelings of low mood, points towards potential issues. Living alone without a support system, not being married, and his family background in an urban setting might contribute to isolation or neglect.\n\nThe job instability and lack of education (though he's in college) might also play a role if it affects his ability to find better opportunities or manage substance use effectively.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is moderately high. He has clear indicators like substance abuse, living alone, and past family issues that can increase recidivism chances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Employment\", \"medium\", \"The individual's age (21 years) may indicate a period of vulnerability as they approach adulthood.
