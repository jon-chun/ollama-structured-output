    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. She's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense. Her age means she's quite young, so maybe she's still developing her skills or facing personal challenges.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. That might be relevant because weight can sometimes correlate with certain behaviors, though I'm not sure if that's the case here. She's living alone, which could mean she doesn't have a support system helping her avoid trouble.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, so maybe she's trying to get better education or find a stable job. That's good because higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. But she only held one job last year, which might indicate instability if she doesn't have consistent income sources.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression suggests she's mentally healthy, which is a positive sign. However, her lack of conviction despite an arrest could mean she's avoiding serious consequences, possibly indicating she feels she can get away without facing harsher penalties.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That might have shaped her early life experiences; maybe she was exposed to negative influences or lacks strong familial support. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and less community support, which could increase recidivism risk.\n\nHer belief in God suggests a strong moral framework, which might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how much that counters other factors like living alone or past exposure to adverse environments.\n\nPutting it all together: Minor offense, education level, living alone, positive mental health, but potential for early-life challenges and urban environment. I think her risk is medium because while she has some mitigating factors, the combination of living situation, past experiences, and support systems doesn't fully protect against rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has a minor non-convicted arrest\", \"low\", \"Her single non-convicted arrest may indicate minimal criminal history and potential for future low-level offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase vulnerability to environmental factors contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age 19\", \"low\", \"Young age suggests emerging skills and potentially lower risk of severe recidivism, but also more exposure to challenges.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Enrollment\", \"high\", \"Education level is a strong indicator of future stability; however, being in college without completing may show inconsistent life choices.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"low\", \"Drug use absence correlates with reduced risk of certain violent recidivistic behaviors.\"),\n    (\"No Recent Depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health indicators suggest resilience against stressors commonly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Urban Residency and Young Age at Home\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates and less community support, increasing risk despite mitigating factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower criminal behavior, though personal faith doesn't guarantee safety.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
