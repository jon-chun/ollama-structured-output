    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black but hasn't been convicted yet. I know race can sometimes affect recidivism rates because of systemic issues and biased policing, but since she's not convicted, that might not directly apply here. So maybe her race doesn't add much risk right now.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight alone usually isn't a big factor unless it affects her health or job opportunities, which I don't have info on. So probably low impact here.\n\nNot married and living alone is interesting. Living arrangements can influence support systems, but since she's an adult in a household of one, maybe that's not the biggest concern. Still, being single could mean fewer resources to help her stay out of trouble.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually helps reduce recidivism because more education can lead to better job prospects and stability. So this factor should be low risk.\n\nShe held one job last year. Employment generally reduces recidivism, so just being employed for a short time shouldn't be too bad\u2014probably medium or low.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive. Drug use can lead to more impulsive behavior, but since she hasn't used drugs, that's a good sign. Maybe this factor is very low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is also a positive. Depression can sometimes be a trigger for other issues, so not experiencing it could lower her risk. Low impact here.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological mother in a household of five might have some implications. Younger individuals might make different decisions or have less life experience. Also, living with multiple people could affect her independence or social support, but since she's 19 and living alone now, maybe that's not as significant. However, it's worth noting.\n\nHer belief in God is a positive factor. Religious beliefs can provide guidance and reduce stress, which might help in avoiding negative behaviors. So this should be low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: education, employment, drug use, and mental health are strong positives. The only concern is her past living arrangement with multiple family members but since she's now living alone, it's not a major red flag. Race isn't a convicted factor here either.\n\nSo overall, the risk seems low to medium. Maybe 40% confidence because there could be other factors I'm missing that aren't mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Education\", \"low\", \"Her high school diploma and current college enrollment suggest she has the skills and support needed for a stable future, which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the past year indicates some level of stability and economic independence, further reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mental Health\", \"very low\", \"Her lack of recent drug use and absence of depression suggest she is in a healthy state, which is protective of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation and Family History\", \"low\", \"While living with her biological mother at a young age may have had some impact, her current independence and single status reduce associated risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Race and Systemic Factors\", \"low\", \"Being Black without a conviction does not inherently increase recidivism risk unless other systemic issues apply, which is not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
