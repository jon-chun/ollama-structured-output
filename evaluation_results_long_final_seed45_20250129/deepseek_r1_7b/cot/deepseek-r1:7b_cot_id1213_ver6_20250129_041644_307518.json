    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black, which might have some impact because of racial disparities in the justice system. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that factor isn't as strong here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, so her education level is pretty good. That usually correlates with lower recidivism because people with better education are more likely to find steady jobs or support themselves after release.\n\nShe's never married and living alone \u2013 that might be a positive factor because she doesn't have a partner to support her if something goes wrong. But I don't know how much that affects risk compared to other factors.\n\nShe only held one job last year, which isn't terrible. Maybe having some income is better than nothing, but not having multiple jobs could mean less financial stability after being released.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month \u2013 both positive signs. Drug abuse can really increase risk, so this definitely lowers her chance of reoffending.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area when young. That's quite a big family, which could provide support but might also have some challenges like limited supervision or inconsistent care for a teenager.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a personal factor, and I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism rates. It might indicate she has good values, but it's hard to quantify.\n\nPutting all this together: no prior convictions, education, stable living situation (living alone), positive behavior (no drugs, depression), and some family background. These are all factors that should lower her risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- No prior convictions significantly reduce recidivism risk.\n- High school diploma and college enrollment indicate strong educational support.\n- Living alone provides stability without partner dependency.\n- Positive behavior (no drug use, no depression) supports better outcomes.\n\nConsidering these factors positively influence her risk. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No prior convictions\", \"low\", \"Having no prior convictions reduces the likelihood of reoffending as there is no established history of criminal behavior to build upon.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Strong educational background supports better job prospects and personal stability, which can aid in avoiding further criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently may provide a sense of security and responsibility, potentially reducing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Consistent substance abuse history is a significant predictor of recidivism; no use suggests lower likelihood of triggers for further offenses.\"),\n    (\"No depression in past month\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability, especially without recent signs of depression, can contribute to overall well-being and reduced risk factors for reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
