    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually indicates good academic habits. This could be a low or medium risk because education often correlates with better job opportunities and stability.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes mean less social support, but since she's 19, it might not have a huge impact yet.\n\nHer past residence history is important too. She lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That could introduce some risk factors because living with multiple people might lead to more stress or less supervision, especially if there were family issues.\n\nShe's never used drugs and hasn't felt depressed recently, which are positive signs for low recidivism.\n\nConsidering her age, being 19, she's still developing. This is a high school graduate, so she has the capacity to learn and make better choices.\n\nHer lack of conviction despite an arrest might mean she's motivated to change, but since it's only one arrest, it's not a strong indicator yet.\n\nPutting all these together, I think her risk factors are low because most indicators point towards stability. She's in education, stable living situation, positive behavior history, and manageable age.\n</think>\n\nThe risk assessment for the 19-year-old female is based on several key factors:\n\n- **Education**: High school diploma with ongoing college enrollment indicates a likely path to better opportunities, reducing recidivism risk (low).\n- **Living Situation**: Living alone at this stage may be due to independence, not necessarily an indicator of future issues.\n- **Family History**: Residing with her mother in a household of five could suggest some level of family support but doesn't indicate systemic issues.\n- **Positive Behavioral Factors**: No drug use and recent positive mental health status are strong indicators against recidivism (low).\n- **Age**: At 19, she is still developing, making her situation more prone to change compared to older individuals.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the relative risk of rearrest within three years is low. The individual has a positive profile with no significant negative risk factors that would predict high or medium risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"She has a strong academic background which suggests good stability and opportunities, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living alone at age 19\", \"low\", \"Living independently is generally associated with lower risk compared to living in larger households or family settings.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
