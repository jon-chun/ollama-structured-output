    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 19-year-old Black female with no prior convictions. Let's break down each factor.\n\nShe has only one arrest but hasn't been convicted. That might not have significant consequences yet. Her age is still young, so maybe she's just starting out and less likely to reoffend.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're physical attributes that don't directly impact criminal behavior.\n\nNo prior marriage or living alone\u2014living situation can sometimes correlate with recidivism if unstable, but since it's her first time, I'm not sure. Maybe she's focused on school now.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment suggest she's working towards better opportunities, which is a positive sign against recidivism.\n\nOne job in the past year\u2014job stability could indicate she has a plan or maybe she's still finding her way. Not much info here to sway either side.\n\nDrug use: No issues in the past four years, so that's good news. Depression hasn't been an issue for her recently, which might mean she's mentally stable enough to handle her situation without increasing risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That could have emotional or social impacts\u2014maybe she has family support now that she's older, but family dynamics can also be stabilizing factors if they're nurturing.\n\nHer religious belief in God might provide some moral guidance and stability, which could reduce the risk of recidivism compared to someone without such support.\n\nConsidering all these points: no prior convictions, positive education background, stable living situation, job, drug use history\u2014all point towards low risk. The only factors that don't directly contribute are her age and family history, but they're mitigated by her current focus on school and potential support from family or religion.\n\nPutting it all together, I'd lean towards a low relative weight for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"1\", \"low\", \"Her lack of prior convictions means she has not faced severe consequences that might indicate higher risk.
