    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old male regarding rearrest recidivism over the next three years. He's White, has a criminal history with one conviction, is 5'7\" and 140 lbs, living alone, has a GED, is in college, worked one job, used marijuana in the past four years but felt down recently.\n\nFirst, his prior criminal record: one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor; recidivists are more likely to reoffend. So that's a high risk factor because past behavior indicates he might not change.\n\nNext, his education level is GED, which can sometimes aid in getting better jobs or support, but it's also a sign of higher responsibility compared to someone with no qualification. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's currently in college, so pursuit of higher education could indicate a desire to improve himself, which might lower the risk slightly. But that depends on his academic performance and personal drive.\n\nAge is 21; younger adults can be more impulsive and have less life experience, but they're often seen as having good intentions too. It's medium because there's potential for both positive change and relapse.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned feeling down recently. The fact that he acknowledges this behavior might indicate a willingness to seek help, which could be low risk. However, occasional drug use without a full-time job or support system isn't ideal.\n\nLiving alone suggests he's independent, perhaps having some life skills, but it also means he might not have a network of support if something goes wrong. Medium risk here because isolation can lead to stress or neglect issues.\n\nConsidering his past living situation with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area adds some instability factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and less stability, which could contribute to higher recidivism. This is a high factor.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might affect his motivation for positive change. Without religious support or guidance, he might not seek help proactively, increasing risk. High factor here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), education and college (medium), job (low), drug use (low), living alone (medium), past instability (high). The high factors pull the prediction towards a higher chance of rearrest. However, some low factors might temper that slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal Record\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which indicates a history of criminal behavior and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \" possessing a GED can sometimes indicate a desire for betterment, but may not necessarily correlate with immediate changes in behavior or risk level.\"),\n    (\"Currently Pursuing Higher Education\", \"low\", \"Engagement in higher education could suggest a commitment to personal development and potentially lower risk of criminal behavior if academic performance is maintained.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, this individual may be more impulsive but still has the potential for positive change and learning from past mistakes.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana Only in Past Four Years)\", \"low\", \" occasional drug use does not necessarily indicate a high risk of reoffending if there is no full-time job or support network in place \"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be isolating and may contribute to stress or neglect, but it also provides independence which could mitigate some negative influences \"),\n    (\"Past Living Situation (Household of 3 in Urban Area)\", \"high\", \"Living with biological parents in an urban area often correlates with higher levels of instability and exposure to potential risk factors such as crime and substance abuse \"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on Life\", \"high\", \"A lack of religious support or guidance may reduce the individual's motivation to seek positive change or avoid criminal behavior \"),\n    (\"Employment During Past Year (One Job)\", \"low\", \"Having one job during the past year, while not ideal, can provide a sense of stability and routine which may help prevent recidivism \"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
