Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, age 21, with a GED and currently enrolled in college. These demographic factors alone don't directly contribute much to recidivism risk unless there are systemic issues, but since it's just him, I'll assign low weight here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor for recidivism because of the history of criminal behavior which could indicate unstable home environment or substance use issues.\n\nHis height and weight don't provide any direct information about his risk, so that's another low factor.\n\nNot being married and living alone suggests he might have fewer social support networks. Social support can help with stress management and job opportunities, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. substance use, especially cannabis, is linked to higher recidivism rates due to possible drug-related issues or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living in such a setting might have contributed to his unstable living situation as he's now living alone. Urban environments can sometimes be stressors if not properly supported, but it's not directly linked to recidivism unless there are underlying issues.\n\nHis lack of religious affiliation could affect his coping mechanisms and relationships, which might influence his behavior. However, this is a bit more abstract and depends on other factors, so maybe medium risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (high), substance use (high), living alone (medium). The rest don't add much. So the prediction leans towards high risk with an 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it reflects past criminal behavior and potential unstable family environment which could translate to higher risk for reoffending.\" ),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is strongly linked to increased recidivism rates due to potential drug-related issues or risky behaviors.\" ),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support and may lead to higher stress levels which could contribute to substance use or unstable behavior.\" ),\n    (\"demographics\", \"low\", \"Demographic factors like age, race, and education level are considered but do not directly contribute significantly without additional context on systemic issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
