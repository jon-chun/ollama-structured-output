    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let's break down each factor she has.\n\nFirst, she's Black and has a high school diploma with some college. Education usually is protective against recidivism because it opens up better job opportunities, which can help reduce crime rates. So that's probably low risk.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor in recidivism unless there are other health issues mentioned, but she's not indicating any drug use or mental health problems here. So maybe medium risk because she's at an average weight but nothing jumps out as concerning.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates, especially if someone is vulnerable in that situation. But since she has a high school diploma, she might have some support systems. Still, I'm leaning towards medium risk here.\n\nShe's had one arrest but not convicted. The number of arrests without a conviction isn't always directly linked to recidivism unless there are patterns or other factors. Since it's just once and she's completing her education, maybe that doesn't add much risk. Could be low.\n\nHer job situation is part-time with one job. Having a steady job usually means less time for criminal activities, so that might mitigate some risk factors. Still, not the strongest protective factor but probably not high.\n\nShe's never used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. No drug use is a strong positive indicator because it reduces opportunities to engage in illegal activities. Similarly, no recent depression suggests she's mentally stable. That should be low risk.\n\nHer background: at a young age, lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Larger households can sometimes lead to higher stress or substance abuse issues, but since she's completing school and has no drug use, this might not be as concerning. Maybe medium because the environment could potentially impact behavior without other evidence.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a protective factor because religious beliefs often correlate with more prosocial behaviors and less likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that should be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: education, lack of drug use, job stability, and belief in God are strong protective factors. The arrest isn't significant enough to raise the risk. The urban environment is a bit concerning but mitigated by her personal factors like education and mental health. \n\nTherefore, I'd assign each factor as low or medium. Most factors point towards low risk overall, so my prediction is she won't reoffend within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma\", \"low\", \"Her education level provides her with better job opportunities and financial stability, which can help reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"While living alone is associated with potential vulnerabilities, her educational background and stable job situation suggest she has support systems in place that could mitigate this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use or Depression in Past Four Months\", \"low\", \"Her lack of drug use and recent absence of depression indicate good mental health and reduced opportunities for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Urban Area Household at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a household size of five could potentially lead to higher stress or substance abuse issues, but her personal factors like education and mental health suggest lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Her religious beliefs are associated with more prosocial behaviors and reduced likelihood of criminal activity compared to those without such beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
