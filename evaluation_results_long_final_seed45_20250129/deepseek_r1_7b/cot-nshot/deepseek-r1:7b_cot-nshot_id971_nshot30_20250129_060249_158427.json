    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might be a red flag because even one arrest can increase the chances of getting convicted in the future. So that's probably a medium weight factor against him.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, which might actually help reduce recidivism. But being enrolled in college is a positive sign because it shows he's committed to improving himself. However, since he was arrested before, maybe he's struggling with motivation, so I'm not sure if that's high or medium.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of depression or low self-esteem, both of which are risk factors for recidivism. So that could be a medium weight factor.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years is mentioned. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause of rearrest, but it can indicate substance abuse issues, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society or find steady employment. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHe feels down during the month and nothing cheers him up. That's a strong indicator of possible depression or anxiety, both mental health issues that can lead to substance abuse or other problems. This should be a high weight factor because it's a clear sign of emotional distress.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Living with the biological parent might have different dynamics compared to living withstepfamilies or extended families. Urban areas can offer more opportunities and support, so maybe this is slightly positive but not too high.\n\nConsidering that he says God has nothing to do with his life, that could mean he's more self-reliant and might face higher external pressures, which can contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. So this is a medium weight factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium arrest history (though not convicted), GED (positive but maybe balanced by prior issues), living alone (negative for isolation), drug use (negative), mental health issues (very negative), living with parent in urban area (slightly positive), and personal belief (neutral). \n\nSo the strongest factors are his mental health issues, which could suggest a high risk. The arrest history is medium but maybe mitigated by other positives like having a GED and being enrolled in college. However, the strong indicators of mental distress might push it towards a high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which can increase future recidivism risk as prior convictions are often correlates with future offenses.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED is generally positive, and being enrolled in college suggests commitment to improving himself.
