    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the risk factors for this person and assign a low, medium, or high weight to each. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 21 years old, which is within the typical age range for rearrest recidivism studies, so maybe that's not a strong indicator here. Next, he has a criminal history\u2014he was arrested once and convicted. That definitely raises his risk because prior convictions are a major factor in recidivism.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs, but since he's 5'7\", that might be on the lower side. However, weight itself isn't a direct indicator without considering other factors like BMIs or surrounding environments.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes indicate higher education aspirations, which might help him reintegrate into society, but being in college could also suggest he's proactive about improving his situation.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone\u2014so no family support system, which is usually protective against recidivism, so that should be low risk here.\n\nUsing drugs (marijuana) once in the past four years might indicate occasional substance use. Substance abuse can contribute to mental health issues or stressors that might affect his ability to reintegrate successfully, so medium risk.\n\nHe felt down during the past month for some time\u2014some level of emotional distress could be a sign of underlying issues affecting his stability. Medium risk here because it's recent but not severe enough to outright classify as high.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of 3 is okay; family living can provide support, so that might actually lower his risk. Maybe medium because it's not the best environment but better than nothing.\n\nHe's in an urban area\u2014cities often have more resources and higher crime rates, which could increase recidivism risk if he reoffenses. So high risk here due to exposure to potential stressors like higher crime or lack of community support.\n\nConsidering God has no influence on his personal issues\u2014he might be dealing with external factors that contribute to his emotional state, so maybe lower risk from that angle.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), substance use (medium), recent distress (medium), living situation in an urban area (high). The rest are either neutral or low. So overall, the high and medium factors might tip the prediction towards high confidence of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"medium\", \"One instance of marijuana use in the past four years may indicate occasional substance use which can contribute to mental health issues or stressors affecting stability.\"),\n    (\"recent_distress\", \"medium\", \"Some level of emotional distress felt during the past month, which could be a sign of underlying issues affecting his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"urban_environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an urban area where higher crime rates and potential exposure to stressors may increase recidivism risk if reoffensing.\"),\n    (\"living_with_biological\u6bcd\u4eb2\", \"low\", \"Living with the biological mother, especially in a household of 3, can provide some support which might mitigate risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
