    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through her risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, someone with a single arrest without a conviction had varying outcomes depending on other factors. She's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Most people in the examples weighed less than that, so maybe this is a bit higher, but it doesn't immediately strike me as a major issue.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. In the examples, being single was sometimes associated with lower recidivism, but it also depended on other factors like drug use or family structure. She has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with better outcomes; more education often means fewer recidivisms.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Some examples had people who held jobs and didn't relapse, so having employment could be positive. However, it also depends on other factors like support systems or living situation.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive sign. Drug abuse often leads to more serious issues and recidivism. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month either, which suggests she's maintaining her mental health, another positive factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or instability, but it also depends on other factors like support networks and community resources.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life, which is generally seen as a positive trait that can aid in personal discipline and stability.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: education and no drug use are strong positives. Having lived with her mother might be somewhat negative if the area is unstable, but she's in college and employed, which should mitigate any negatives from living arrangement. She hasn't been arrested before and isn't depressed, so overall, it seems like a low risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has only one arrest without a conviction, which is a positive indicator as shown in similar cases where such individuals often had lower recidivism rates despite minor offenses.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight of 190 lbs is within a typical range for her height and does not indicate any health concerns that might affect her ability to reintegrate after incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of stability, but it also depends on other factors like support systems which are not mentioned here.
