    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this specific case. Let me start by looking at all the factors mentioned in her profile.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old Black female with no prior convictions, which might be low risk. Her weight here is probably low because she hasn't been convicted and is relatively young.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs, which isn't too concerning unless it's a significant factor related to health or substance use, but since she's not using drugs, maybe this doesn't add much. So perhaps medium weight as it's a neutral point without other factors tied to her weight.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate support systems, so being single might be slightly low risk if she has no family nearby for support.\n\nHigh school diploma is on her resume; education usually correlates with lower recidivism. So this should be a high factor because it shows she's completed basic education which can positively influence her future stability.\n\nShe's enrolled in a 2-year college, which means she might still be focused on getting an education or improving her skills, so that adds to her positive risk factors. High weight again here.\n\nShe held one job during the year; having gainful employment is usually beneficial and reduces recidivism risk. So high weight because job stability can prevent further issues.\n\nNo drug use history is a strong positive indicator of low risk. She's never used drugs, which means she's likely in a clean state, so this factor would have high weight as it's a significant protective measure.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month; mental health is crucial for recidivism rates. Since she's not experiencing depression, that's another positive factor with high weight.\n\nLiving alone doesn't necessarily mean bad, but in some contexts, it can indicate lower support. However, without specific info on surrounding environments or family ties, maybe medium weight as it's neutral unless there are other factors like lack of social support.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban areas might have better resources and higher crime rates, but since she's Black and from an urban background, that could be a mitigating factor if the community has positive programs. So perhaps low to medium weight here because it depends on the surrounding environment.\n\nConsidering God as a factor; this is a personal belief and can influence mental health or life choices, so maybe medium weight as it's subjective but generally positive.\n\nPutting all these together: education (high), job (high), no drug use (high), current mental health (high). The other factors like age, living situation, and family support are either low or neutral. So the high-weighted factors are strong positives, making her overall risk of rearrest likely low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has prior convictions\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, indicating no significant criminal history which usually correlates with lower recidivism risk in the short term\"),\n    (\"Weight (190 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"Her weight is within a healthy range and doesn't indicate any health issues related to substance abuse or other factors that could influence recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married, living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse might suggest she has no immediate family support network which can sometimes be associated with higher risk in the short term but is mitigated by her education and job experience\"),\n    (\"High school diploma (2-year college enrollment)\", \"high\", \"Completing high school and being enrolled in higher education are positive indicators of future stability and reduced likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job during the year\", \"high\", \"Having a gainful employment history is strongly associated with lower recidivism risk as it indicates stable income and opportunities for upward mobility\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"high\", \"No recent substance abuse history significantly reduces the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that can lead to further arrests or complications\"),\n    (\"Has not felt depressed over past month\", \"high\", \"Lack of recent mental health issues is a positive indicator as it suggests no current stressors or barriers affecting her ability to reintegrate into society positively\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban area (household size 5)\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban environment can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors but the family support from living with her mother and being Black may mitigate this risk slightly\"),\n    (\"Believes God has something to do with personal life\", \"medium\", \"While her belief in God is a personal choice, it could influence her mental health and decision-making which might positively affect her recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
