    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. His weight is 140 lbs, height is 5'7\", and he lives alone. He has a GED and is enrolled in college. He worked one job this year. He used marijuana before and feels down sometimes.\n\nLooking at the previous examples, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Low factors don't contribute much, medium ones have some impact, and high means they're significant.\n\nFirst, being arrested once (not convicted) is a medium risk because arrest history can affect recidivism but not as harshly if he's completed his sentence or is in school.\n\nHaving a GED is actually protective since education can lead to better job opportunities. So that might be low risk.\n\nLiving alone doesn't seem to be linked to higher rearrest rates, so maybe low.\n\nHe's enrolled in college which is good for his future, so again, low risk.\n\nUsing marijuana isn't too bad compared to harder drugs, but it still shows drug use, so medium.\n\nThe fact that he feels down a lot could indicate underlying issues or stressors. That might be high because chronic stress can lead to more substance use and other problems.\n\nHe's 21, which is young, so maybe low risk as younger individuals sometimes have different needs.\n\nConsidering he lives with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014so that's medium exposure but not super high risk since it's a stable environment.\n\nNo prior marriage makes him eligible for spousal support if he reoffs, which could help reduce recidivism. So maybe low.\n\nHe believes God has no role in his life, so that's probably high because lack of religious support can lead to more impulsive behaviors and higher chance of relapse.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium from marijuana use, high from lack of faith affecting behavior, medium from feeling down, medium from living situation. The rest are low or neutral. So overall, the risk is on the higher side but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Being arrested once can be a risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's not followed by a conviction.\"),\n    (\"GED and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college are protective factors that may reduce rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase the risk of rearrest unless there are other contributing factors like substance use or stress.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year can be positive as it shows stability and potential for income support if re-arrested.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past is a moderate risk factor, but it does not necessarily guarantee rearrest if no other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"Mental health symptoms\", \"high\", \"Feeling down or experiencing stress may indicate underlying mental health issues that can contribute to substance abuse and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is relatively young, which may reduce the risk of certain behavioral patterns associated with older adults.\"),\n    (\"Family living arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological parents in an urban area provides some stability but does not guarantee lower rearrest risk compared to other arrangements like living with relatives or friends.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious support can sometimes lead to increased impulsive behaviors and substance use, which may contribute to recidivism efforts.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
