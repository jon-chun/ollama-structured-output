    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through each of her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a low to medium risk factor because it shows some prior contact with the system, which can sometimes indicate past behavior issues.\n\nHer weight is 5'6\" and 190 lbs. Not sure if that directly affects recidivism, but maybe her living situation could relate to that. She's living alone, which might be a medium risk factor because living alone can lead to isolation or stressors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nShe's never been married and currently single, living alone\u2014this could be considered medium risk if she's experiencing personal issues that might affect her stability.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job isn't bad, but it also doesn't indicate a strong attachment or past successes which might lower risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014that's a solid positive factor, so low risk here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the last month\u2014good sign for mental health stability, another low risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes correlate with more stressors or different environments, but having multiple family members might mitigate that to some extent.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life\u2014this is a positive factor indicating strong spiritual support and personal guidance, which would be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are low except maybe the living situation. Since she's in an urban area with multiple family members, maybe the risk isn't as high as medium or even low because she has strong support systems. Also, her education and not being married contribute positively. Her lack of recent issues and stable environment could mean lower recidivism.\n\nI think overall, considering all factors lean towards low risk. So I'll predict a NO outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time but not convicted)\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once shows past interaction with the system, which can sometimes indicate behavioral issues that might affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone (5'6\\\" and 190 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lead to isolation or stressors, potentially increasing risk factors in a different way compared to shared living situations.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma (Enrolled in 2-year college)\", \"low\", \" possessing a high school diploma and currently enrolled in higher education is typically associated with better educational outcomes and lower recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Never Married but Currently Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse can sometimes lead to social or personal instability, which might affect long-term stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 Job During the Year\", \"low\", \"Having one job during the year indicates stable income sources and work experience, which are generally positive indicators of employability and reduced criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use (Past Four Years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a significant positive indicator of substance abuse stability and reduced risk factors related to substance abuse issues in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Not Felt Depressed (Past Month)\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed for the past month indicates good mental health, which supports overall well-being and reduces behavioral issues that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Mother in Household of 5 in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area with multiple family members might present unique challenges or environments that could slightly increase risk factors due to potential exposure to urban stressors, despite the supportive family environment.\"),\n    (\"Believes God has Something to Do with Her Life\", \"low\", \"Strong spiritual support and personal guidance typically correlate with better life outcomes, reducing behavioral issues likely to lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
