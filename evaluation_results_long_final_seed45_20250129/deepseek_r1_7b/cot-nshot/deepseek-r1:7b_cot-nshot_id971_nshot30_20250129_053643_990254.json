    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant risk factor because criminal history increases the likelihood of reoffending. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That's pretty slim. Slim individuals can sometimes be at higher risk due to potential health issues or substance abuse problems. So I'd assign this a medium weight because it's relevant but not the most critical factor on its own.\n\nNever married and living alone: Living in a single, stable environment is generally protective against recidivism compared to co-habitating with someone else who might lead to more issues. But since he's never married, maybe that's a slight risk? Or perhaps it's more about living situation type rather than the actual status. Hmm, medium weight.\n\nGED certificate and enrolled in 4-year college: Having a GED can sometimes indicate lower education levels or less employment opportunities, but being enrolled suggests he's taking steps to improve his situation. This could be low to medium risk depending on the context, so I'll assign it as medium because while it shows commitment, it doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are other issues.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year: Employment is usually a positive factor in reducing recidivism since having income can help support family and reduce stress. So this should be low risk.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana): Drug use, especially marijuana, can have negative consequences but doesn't necessarily guarantee reoffending to drugs. It's more about the potential for other substance abuse or behavioral issues. So maybe medium weight here.\n\nFelt down during the month: This could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors in his life. High risk because mental health issues often lead to substance use and other problematic behaviors, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area: Co-parenting can sometimes have its pros and cons, but the fact that he's living with his mother suggests a stable environment. However, it might also mean limited independence, which could be a risk. Medium weight because while it's protective, there are other factors at play.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal matters: This is a significant factor. If someone views their life as separate from a higher power, they might not seek support when needed, leading to more relapse or risky behaviors. High risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high-risk factors are the arrest history and belief in separation from religion. The rest are either medium or low. So weighing them: high for arrest and religion, medium for others like weight and living situation, etc.\n\nNow, considering each factor's impact:\n\n- High (arrest): 0.8\n- Medium (weight): 0.6\n- Medium (living alone): 0.5\n- Medium (GED + college): 0.7\n- Medium (job held): 0.9\n- Medium (drug use): 0.4\n- High (sentiment): 0.8\n- Medium (household size): 0.6\n- High (God factor): 0.9\n\nCalculating the average: (0.8 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.9) / 9 = Let me add them up:\n\n0.8+0.6=1.4; +0.5=1.9; +0.7=2.6; +0.9=3.5; +0.4=3.9; +0.8=4.7; +0.6=5.3; +0.9=6.2\n\nTotal is 6.2 divided by 9 \u2248 0.69, so about 69% confidence.\n\nSince the high risk factors point towards a higher chance, but not certainty, and considering that he's enrolled in college which might indicate proactive steps, I lean towards predicting YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"His criminal history increases his likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be protective but doesn't guarantee safety.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job is positive for reducing stress and financial instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"While marijuana isn't severe, it could lead to other substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental health indicators\", \"high\", \"Feeling down may signal underlying mental health concerns that can affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living with mother\", \"medium\", \"Stable living arrangement but limited independence which might be risky.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"high\", \"Believing God has no involvement in personal matters can lead to lack of support seeking, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"While he's enrolled, lower education levels may correlate with less employability and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"Living with two others doesn't necessarily guarantee safety or security.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.69\n}\n```",
