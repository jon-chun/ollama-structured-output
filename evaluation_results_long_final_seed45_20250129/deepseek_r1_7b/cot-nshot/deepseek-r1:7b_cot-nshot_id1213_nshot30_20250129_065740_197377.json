    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assign relative weights to each risk factor for this 19-year-old Black female. Let's go through her factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a single arrest which might indicate some prior issues that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe weighs 5 feet 6 inches and 190 lbs. Her weight is within a normal range for her height, so no significant issue there.\n\nNever married living alone: Living alone can be isolating but doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless she has substance abuse issues or other personal problems.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college: Education level is positive as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and lower chances of reoffending. So this might have a low risk factor.\n\nHeld one job during the year: Having work experience can be beneficial, indicating she's stable and has skills that could prevent her from reverting to criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in past four years: Drug abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so not using drugs shows low risk here.\n\nNot felt depressed in past month: Feeling depressed isn't directly tied to recidivism but if it were severe, it might be a red flag. Since she's not feeling down, this is a positive sign.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of five: A larger household might indicate more support and less stress, reducing the risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life: This is a strong indicator against recidivism as it suggests positive spiritual influences that can aid in personal well-being.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, each contributes differently. The high school diploma and college enrollment are strong protective factors (high weight). No arrests or drug use also contribute positively. On the flip side, living with her mother might have some negatives if she's exposed to family issues, but since it's a larger household and she's doing well personally, that's mitigated.\n\nPutting this together, the risk is lower than average because of her education, employment, and positive personal situation despite minor factors like prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has only one non-convicted arrest, which might indicate past issues that could potentially lead to recidivism but not significantly so.\"),\n    (\"Weight Category\", \"low\", \"Her weight is within a normal range for her height, indicating no health-related risk factors related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates unless accompanied by personal issues such as substance abuse or financial instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma combined with enrollment in a 2-year college significantly reduces the likelihood of recidivism compared to individuals without such credentials.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year shows stability and practical life skills, which can deter reoffending behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of lower recidivism risk compared to those with substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed for the past month suggests positive personal health, which can aid in avoiding negative life choices that might lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five may indicate family support but could also suggest exposure to potential family issues if not mitigated by other factors.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs and Personal Values\", \"high\", \"Strongly believes that God has something to do with her life, which can positively influence personal behavior and deter negative choices contributing to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
