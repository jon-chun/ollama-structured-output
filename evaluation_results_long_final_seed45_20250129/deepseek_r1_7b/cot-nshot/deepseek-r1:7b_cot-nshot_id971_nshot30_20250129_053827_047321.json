    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this person based on their risk factors. Let's start by looking at each of his factors one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a history of being arrested once but convicted. That seems like it could be a medium risk factor because prior convictions are typically indicators of recidivism. So I'll assign medium weight to that.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, which might lower his risk, so maybe low weight here?\n\nHe's never been married and living alone\u2014so no family support, which could be a medium factor contributing to higher recidivism.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years\u2014he\u2019s using illicit drugs, which is definitely a high risk because drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior.\n\nHe feels down or demotivated sometimes\u2014that's a sign of possible mental health issues. I think that's a medium-high risk because it could affect his ability to reintegrate into society or commit new crimes.\n\nAt 21 years old, he\u2019s still young, but the age itself doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are other factors like unstable living conditions or family issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three\u2014small household might mean less supervision and more risk of substance abuse or other negative behaviors. So medium-high weight here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which could influence his motivation to change behavior; this might be low risk since lack of religious support might not directly correlate with higher recidivism but can also vary based on personal beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (medium), GED and college enrollment (low), single living situation (medium), drug use (high), emotional distress (medium-high), household size (medium-high). The strongest factors are high from drug use and medium from the past arrest. The low factors might temper that a bit, but I think overall it's leaning towards high risk.\n\nSo, with that in mind, his prediction is likely to be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight because prior conviction can indicate higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Low risk as having a GED often correlates with better job opportunities and stability, and being enrolled in college may encourage positive changes.\"),\n    (\"Single Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk due to potential lack of support network which could contribute to unstable living or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"High risk as drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress/Down Mood\", \"medium-high\", \"Medium-high risk because feelings of demotivation can affect ability to reintegrate into society positively or commit new crimes.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"medium-high\", \"Medium-high risk as smaller households may lack supervision, potentially leading to substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Young Age (21)\", \"low\", \"Low weight because age alone doesn't directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors like unstable living conditions or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Mother in Small Household\", \"medium-high\", \"Medium-high risk due to possible influence on behavior and substance abuse from living environment, though not directly linked to religion as he doesn't believe in God.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
