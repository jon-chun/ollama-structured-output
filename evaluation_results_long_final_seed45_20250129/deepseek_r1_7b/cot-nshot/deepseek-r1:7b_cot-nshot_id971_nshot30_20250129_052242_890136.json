    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old male who is White. He has one arrest and conviction, weighs 140 lbs at 5'7\", never married, living alone, with a GED, enrolled in college, worked one job, used marijuana, felt down recently, lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area, and believes God doesn't influence his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the risk factors from the examples given. From Examples 1 to 30, certain factors like age, prior arrests, living situation, education level, substance use, feeling down, and family background were considered. \n\nLooking at this case:\n- **Arrests**: He has one arrest and conviction. That's a medium risk factor because prior convictions are linked with higher recidivism.\n- **Age**: 21 is near the typical reoffender age, so medium risk. People around that age often start to engage in criminal behavior again.\n- **Education Level**: He has a GED but is enrolled in college. Education can lower recidivism if it leads to better job opportunities, but he's already attending college, which might mitigate some risk, making this factor maybe low or medium.\n- **Living Alone**: He's living alone, which could increase stress and substance use, so that's a medium risk.\n- **Substance Use (Marijuana)**: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known predictor of recidivism, especially if it leads to feelings of low mood or hopelessness, making this high risk.\n- **Feeling Down**: He felt down recently. Emotional distress can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors, so that's medium-high risk.\n- **Family Background**: Small household (3) with living with his biological mother in an urban area. Family support can influence recidivism; living alone or in a smaller family might have mixed effects but considering he lived with his mother, maybe some support, so low to medium.\n- **God Influence**: He believes God has no role, which could reduce self blame and responsibility for his actions, making it high risk as he might not seek help.\n\nPutting this together: Medium-high risk factors include prior arrest, living alone, drug use, feeling down, and lack of God's influence. These should push the prediction towards YES. However, his GED is a positive factor but since he's in college, maybe that slightly reduces risk.\n\nI think overall, the risk is high enough to predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"He has one arrest and conviction which can increase recidivism risk as prior convictions are often linked to higher reoffending rates.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age is near the typical reoffender age, increasing the likelihood of engaging in similar criminal behavior again.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"He has a GED and is enrolled in college, which can lower recidivism risk as education often leads to better job opportunities and self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stress and substance use risks, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant risk factor for reoffending as it can lead to further criminal behavior and emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"feeling_down\", \"medium_high\", \"Recent feelings of low mood or hopelessness may contribute to substance abuse or risky behaviors, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area provides some support but doesn't guarantee stability, possibly mitigating some risk factors.\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has no role in personal events may reduce accountability and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors without seeking help.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
