    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which isn't too high but still within the teenage years where recidivism rates might be higher compared to adults. So maybe a medium risk there.\n\nShe has one arrest but no convictions. Since she's not convicted, it's about her criminal history; I think this would add some low risk because she hasn't actually committed any crimes that resulted in incarceration or significant legal consequences beyond an arrest.\n\nHer weight is 190 lbs and height 5'6\". Within a normal range for her age, so probably no direct impact on recidivism unless there's something about her health here, but the data doesn't suggest that. So maybe low risk factor here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which might help with reintegration, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in 2-year college. Education is usually a positive predictor of better outcomes, so that should be low risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which is manageable and shows some ability to function on her own. That's another low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in past four years; that's great because substance abuse correlates with higher recidivism rates. So no risk there.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month, so mental health seems stable. No immediate risk factors related to mood or depression here.\n\nAt a young age (19), she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors, which might contribute to lower self-esteem or other issues that could lead to recidivism. So this is probably a medium risk factor because while it's not high-risk living conditions, it's urban, which has its own set of challenges.\n\nShe believes in God (God has something to do with her personal life). This is a positive factor as religious belief can provide support and structure, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium for urban living at 19, but other factors like education, no prior convictions, stable job, etc., are strong protective factors. The high school diploma and college enrollment contribute to low risk despite her age being in a vulnerable stage. Overall, considering the positive factors outweigh the medium risk from urban living, I think she might have a lower chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- Medium risk for living in an urban area at 19 years old.\n- Low risk due to no prior convictions and stable living situation.\n- Low risk with her education background and job experience.\n- Positive factors like mental health stability, which are low risk.\n\nThe overall prediction is NO with a confidence of 45%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 19 places her in a vulnerable stage where recidivism rates might be higher compared to adults.
