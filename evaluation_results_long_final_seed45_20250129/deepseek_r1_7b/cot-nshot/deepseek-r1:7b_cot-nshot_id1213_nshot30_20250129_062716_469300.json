    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the given case for a 19-year-old Black female with several risk factors and predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is relatively young but also quite old enough that she might have some life experience. She's been arrested once but not convicted, so she has a criminal history, albeit just one arrest without a conviction. That seems like a moderate risk factor because even if she didn't get convicted, having an arrest can influence her likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs and is 5 feet 6 inches, which doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of physical health as a risk factor. Her weight might be more relevant to other areas like substance use or health issues, but since she hasn't used drugs recently, that's probably not a concern here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone, so she has no family support structure. Living alone can increase the risk of isolation, which in turn can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. That would likely have a high relative weight because living alone is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. While education itself isn't directly a risk factor, not completing a degree could indicate that she might drop out and potentially engage in risky behavior again. Alternatively, her ongoing education could be a positive sign if she's committed to it, but since she's just at the beginning of higher education, maybe the low relative weight applies.\n\nShe's held one job during the year, which suggests some level of employability and stability. Employed individuals often have better support systems and are less likely to become involved in criminal activities. So this might have a medium or even low relative weight depending on other factors.\n\nHer drug use history is clean\u2014no drugs in the past four years. That's a strong positive indicator, reducing her risk of engaging in substance abuse, which is a known contributor to recidivism. So this factor would probably be weighted low because it's mitigating a potential risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is another positive sign. Emotional stability is linked to lower recidivism rates as individuals with consistent emotional states are less likely to act on impulsive decisions that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a larger household can sometimes be associated with more stress or instability, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. However, since she's living with her own parent, who is her biological mother, it's possible that family support is strong and mitigating some risks. This factor could have a medium relative weight because while it's not directly a risk, the environment can influence behavior.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This indicates a sense of spirituality or moral support, which can reduce recidivism risk as individuals who rely on higher values are less likely to engage in criminal activities driven by external pressures.\n\nPutting this all together: The high weight factors are the living alone (high), no drug use (low), and maybe her education status if it's more about not completing school. But considering she has a high school diploma, perhaps that's low. Her current job is medium, but with other mitigating factors like spiritual support and living with family, I think this might actually be on the lower end for recidivism risk.\n\nWait, in the examples provided earlier, cases with living alone had higher NO outcomes, meaning they didn't rearrest. However, education level can vary; someone with a diploma might have better opportunities, which could lead to lower risk. Since she's enrolled in college, that might indicate commitment and less risk compared to those who don't attend.\n\nConsidering all these points, while some factors are mitigating like her clean drug use, no depression, and spiritual support, the primary risk is living alone without any family support or a sense of community. Therefore, despite positive signs, she's at moderate risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the individual has both mitigating factors (clean drug use, no depression, spiritual support) and a significant risk factor (living alone). The overall risk is considered medium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"She was arrested once but not convicted.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"She lives alone without family support.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Stability\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma with ongoing college enrollment and one job experience.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
