    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the person is a 21-year-old male who's White, arrested once and convicted. He's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Never married, living alone. Has a GED and enrolled in college. Worked one job, used marijuana, felt down recently. Lived with his bio mom in a household of 3 in an urban area, believes God isn't involved.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Age**: He's 21. The example cases have older individuals (like 28-30), but being a young adult might reduce recidivism risk compared to someone older with more criminal history.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: He has one arrest and a conviction. In the examples, similar cases had varying outcomes based on this factor.\n\n3. **Gender**: White is in some examples leading to YES or NO outcomes, but overall, race can be complex here.\n\n4. **Height/Weight**: His measurements are below average (5'7\"/140 lbs). Smaller stature might correlate with lower recidivism, as seen in the example where a similar case had a lower risk.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married; this is positive and could indicate less exposure to certain risks.\n\n6. **Living Alone**: Yes, living alone can be risky but maybe mitigated by not having family support.\n\n7. **Education Level**: Has a GED, which in the examples sometimes correlates with lower recidivism if it's seen as a positive step.\n\n8. **Employment**: He has one job; stable income might help reduce rearrest chances.\n\n9. **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana use is moderate but in the examples, even recent drug use can be significant.\n\n10. **Mental Health**: Felt down recently, which could indicate stress or depression, possibly linked to higher recidivism.\n\n11. **Household Size at Age of Arrest**: Lived with his bio mom in a household of 3; smaller families might offer more support but also depend on other factors.\n\n12. **Belief in God**: He says God has nothing to do with it, which is a positive sign for recidivism.\n\nPutting this together: The arrest and conviction are present, but he's young, educated, living alone, etc., which are mitigating factors. However, the recent drug use and lack of support from family (if they live apart) could increase risk. His belief in God is actually a protective factor. So while there are some positive indicators, the presence of recent drug use and arrest might suggest a low but not extremely high risk.\n\nIn terms of weighting:\n\n- **Arrests/Convictions**: Medium - One conviction can influence, but with other mitigating factors.\n- **Drug Use**: Medium - Recent use could be significant.\n- **Marital Status**: High mitigating effect as he's never married and living alone might mean less support network, which is a risk factor. Wait, maybe it's low because being single in an urban area can have different dynamics compared to rural areas? Hmm, but in the examples, living with parents was considered safe (like example 5), so perhaps this case is similar.\n- **Mental Health**: Medium - Recent feelings of downness could indicate stress or depression, which are risk factors.\n\nSo overall, maybe his recent arrest and drug use are medium weights, marital status being never married might be a high mitigating factor. Education (GED) is positive, so that's low to medium protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One conviction present which can influence recidivism risk but mitigated by other factors like age, education, and living situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use is significant and could correlate with higher recidivism risk despite positive factors like education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high mitigating factor\", \"Never married in an urban area where he lives alone might indicate less support network which can be a risk factor, but it's mitigated by his stable living situation compared to rural areas where parents live.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of downness could indicate stress or depression linked to higher recidivism risk despite being 21 years old and having a GED.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
