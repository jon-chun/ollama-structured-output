    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old Black female. She's got several risk factors that I need to consider.\n\nFirst, she has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. That's interesting because education can sometimes lead to better opportunities and stability, so maybe a medium weight here since it's not a clear indicator of recidivism on its own.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. That might be a bit concerning, but again, it could also indicate independence which is positive. I'll assign her a low risk from this factor.\n\nHer drug use history shows she hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. That's a good sign as substance abuse can lead to further issues if not addressed, so maybe low weight here too.\n\nShe's never felt depressed in the last month, which suggests she's maintaining mental health. That should be another low risk factor.\n\nLooking at her living situation: she lives alone with her biological mother in an urban area, and the household size is 5. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might increase risk slightly, so maybe a medium weight for that.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal issues, which could imply she's seeking support or has strong moral values, potentially reducing recidivism risk\u2014so low here.\n\nHer past arrest count is one but not convicted. If she's been arrested once and not convicted, it might indicate some instability but doesn't necessarily mean she'll reoffend. So medium weight for that factor.\n\nPutting all these together: education, employment, substance use, mental health are positive signs with lower risk. Living in an urban area with a larger household is moderate. One prior arrest without conviction is also moderate. \n\nI think the overall risk here is low to medium because she's showing several protective factors and mitigating circumstances. Her previous behavior suggests she might be on a path towards stability rather than reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high school diploma\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma, which can indicate potential for better opportunities and could mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in 2-year college\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in higher education may suggest commitment to long-term goals and stability.\"),\n    (\"no drugs past four years\", \"low\", \"No drug use history is a positive indicator of recent substance abuse prevention and reduced risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"not felt depressed last month\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent mental health issues can indicate current stability and resilience which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"biological mother living with her in urban area, household size 5\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area could be associated with higher crime rates or social stressors, but larger households often have more resources which might mitigate some risk factors.\"),\n    (\"God has something to do with her personal issues\", \"low\", \"Strong moral values and seeking support from religion can indicate a desire for positive outcomes and may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"one prior arrest, not convicted\", \"medium\", \"A single non-convicted arrest suggests past behavior without severe consequences but could be an indicator of potential future instability or criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
