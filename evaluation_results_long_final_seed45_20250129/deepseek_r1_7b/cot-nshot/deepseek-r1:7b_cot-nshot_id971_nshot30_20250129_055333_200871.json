    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has one arrest but it wasn'tConvicted, so maybe it doesn't count as much? He weighs 140 lbs and is 5'7\", which might not be directly relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which could mean he's relying on others less, possibly affecting his stability. His GED certificate shows he has some education but maybe isn't enough for a job or further studies.\n\nHe's enrolled in a 4-year college, so maybe he's committed to improving himself, but that depends on how well he uses that time. He held one job last year, which is positive because having income can help with stability and reduce the need for substance abuse.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, which is a drug use. Drug use can lead to more problems, so that's a negative factor. Also, he felt down recently, which might indicate some mental health issues or stressors.\n\nAt 21, living on his own with a small household (size 3) suggests he's an adult making his own decisions, but it could also mean he doesn't have support network around him, leading to higher risk of issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one arrest isn't great, but noConviction might be okay. GED and college enrollment are positive signs. His job history is good. However, drug use and recent low mood might indicate underlying issues that could lead to problems if not addressed.\n\nPutting it all together, I think he's at a medium risk of rearrest because while there are mitigating factors like education and employment, the arrest record, substance use, and personal feelings contribute to some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but it was not a conviction.
