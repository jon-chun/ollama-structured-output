    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21 years old. From the examples provided, most people were either in their late teens or early twenties when they had issues. Younger individuals might have more time to develop better habits or find support systems, but being 21 isn't necessarily a bad sign on its own. I'd give this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, he's been arrested once and convicted. Having a criminal history definitely increases the risk of recidivism. The examples show that people with arrest records often have higher rearrest rates, so this should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHe's identified as White, which might not directly impact his risk here since race isn't typically a primary factor in recidivism unless there are systemic issues, but without specific data, I'll treat it as medium weight.\n\nWeight is 140 lbs. The examples include a range of weights, from underweight to much heavier individuals. Being at a healthy weight can contribute positively, so this might slightly reduce the risk, giving it a low weight.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Living in a stable environment usually helps with recidivism, so having no spouse or partner could increase the risk by 20%. I'll assign medium here.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Completing high school and continuing education are positive factors that can lead to better job opportunities and skills, reducing recidivism. Since he's even attending college now, this should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHe's held 1 job during the year. Employment, especially with some stability, is good for recidivism. One job might not be enough but shows some commitment, so medium weight.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use can have negative impacts on employment and relationships, increasing rearrest chances. This should be a high-weight factor.\n\nFelt down during the past month; some mood swings or low mood. Emotional issues can affect substance use and job performance, so this increases risk. High weight here.\n\nAt 21, having lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living with family can provide support and stability, which might lower the risk slightly. Medium weight.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal issues. If someone doesn't turn to religion for coping or seeking help, they might not seek necessary resources, increasing recidivism chances. High weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: high-weight factors include prior arrest, lack of marriage, belief in no divine intervention. Medium factors are age and college enrollment. Low factors are weight and job history.\n\nCalculating the risk, the high-weight negative factors (arrests, lack of support) likely pull the prediction higher towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Age is 21 years old.
