    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 21-year-old man will be rearrested within three years. He's White, male, 5'7\", weighs 140 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED, enrolled in college, worked one job, used marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived with his biological mom in a household of 3 in an urban area, and believes God doesn't influence his life.\n\nFirst, let me go through each example provided to see how similar cases were handled. Looking at the examples, factors like age, prior convictions, living situation, education level, substance use, and family background seem significant.\n\nHis prior conviction is one factor\u2014being convicted once might increase recidivism risk. But he's 21, which is relatively young for rearrest within three years. His GED could be a positive indicator as GED holders often have better job prospects, but since he's enrolled in college now, maybe that's more relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone\u2014these are common factors, so not sure how much they contribute. Not using much substance other than marijuana\u2014he used it before but now is clean? Or still uses it sometimes? The text says \"has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down...\". That might indicate ongoing issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother suggests a stable environment, which could be protective. But if he's now living alone, maybe there are underlying issues contributing to his mood swings or depression-like feelings.\n\nConsidering all examples, factors that increase recidivism risk include prior convictions, substance use, unemployment, and unstable family environments. Factors like education level and being in college can mitigate the risk.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which might help with job stability and reducing recidivism. His age (21) is on the younger side, but prior conviction could still be significant.\n\nPutting it all together: his prior conviction increases risk slightly, but he's actively seeking education and employment, which are positive factors. The household size of 3 isn't too large, so maybe a medium impact? His living situation alone might indicate some stress or issues contributing to his mood swings.\n\nOverall, considering everything, I think the risk is low for rearrest because he's actively working on improving himself through education and college, which can lead to better job opportunities. However, prior conviction still adds some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which could increase recidivism risk but is mitigated by his current educational pursuits and active seeking of employment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"He uses marijuana, which may indicate occasional substance use but not necessarily long-term dependency that would significantly contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college, which suggests pursuit of education and potential career advancement rather than unemployment contributing to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area, suggesting a relatively stable environment which may contribute positively to his mental health and stability\"),\n    (\"current_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone could indicate underlying issues contributing to mood swings but also shows initiative in addressing personal circumstances\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Has a GED and is enrolled in college, both positive indicators that could reduce recidivism risk through better job opportunities and life skills development\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
