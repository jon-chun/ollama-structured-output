    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might not be a big deal since being arrested without a conviction could just mean a minor offense or maybe he's actively working on getting better. I think that doesn't carry much weight here.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. A GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, which might reduce his chances of rearrest compared to someone without it. But since he's also enrolled in college, which is a positive sign for future stability.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with rearrest unless there's something else involved, but generally, being independent can be good.\n\nUsing marijuana isn't a huge problem unless it's frequent or severe. He felt down recently, so maybe that's an indicator of stress or mental health issues, which could affect his ability to function positively in the future.\n\nHe was raised with both parents in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or stressors, but since he's living alone and is college-bound, this might not be as impactful as it seems.\n\nConsidering that he believes God has no role in his life, which could mean he's more self-reliant or focused on personal growth rather than spirituality for support. But without knowing how he handles stress, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting all these together: He has positive factors like GED and college enrollment, which should lower his risk. The arrest isn't a big red flag since he hasn't been convicted yet. His living situation is okay, but maybe the recent feelings of low mood could be a concern. I think overall, with the positive factors leaning towards him not reoffending, I might lean towards \"NO\" for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has one prior arrest\", \"low\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but has not been convicted.
