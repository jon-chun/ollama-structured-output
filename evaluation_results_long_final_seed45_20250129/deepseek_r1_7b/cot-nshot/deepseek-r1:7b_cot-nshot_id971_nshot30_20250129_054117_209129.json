    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag\u2014it shows past behavior that could affect his likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHe's got a GED but isn't enrolled in school anymore. Education can sometimes predict future outcomes; not having a high school diploma might indicate he's less likely to find stable employment, which is a concern for recidivism.\n\nLiving alone is another point. While living with family or a partner usually provides support, living on his own could mean he has fewer resources and might face isolation.\n\nHe's using marijuana, but since it's legal in many places now, maybe that's not as significant unless there are other drug issues to consider.\n\nFeeling down for a month is a bit concerning. It suggests some level of emotional distress, which can affect motivation and relationships\u2014potentially leading to more problematic behavior if not addressed.\n\nAt 21, he's considered young, but still in his prime years. Young adults might be more adaptable, but if they have significant issues like the ones listed, that could change things.\n\nHis past living situation with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area shows some instability or challenges at home, which can contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nNot believing in God (or not having any religion) might affect his motivation and support system. Without religious backing, he might rely more on personal will or external factors, which could influence his behavior over the next three years.\n\nPutting all these together: The arrest history is a strong indicator of past problems. The GED without college enrollment might indicate limited opportunities. Living alone and feeling down could increase stress, but not being in school might limit support systems. However, his young age could mitigate some of these risks if he's making the best of his situation.\n\nI think his overall risk is medium because while there are several factors pointing towards a higher chance, his relatively young age and some positive factors like GED enrollment might lower it slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction suggest past behavior that could affect future recidivism.
