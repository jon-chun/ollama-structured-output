    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 years old. Recidivism rates can be lower in younger individuals as they gain more life experience and skills over time, so maybe a low or medium weight here.\n\nHe's White, which doesn't directly indicate anything about recidivism but could influence based on other factors like neighborhood or prior convictions. Since he has one prior arrest and a conviction, that's a medium weight risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches; since he's in the examples with similar heights, maybe this isn't a significant factor here, so low weight.\n\nWeight: 140 lbs doesn't seem like an issue on its own. Maybe no direct impact, so low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone: Some studies suggest that living situation can affect recidivism due to lack of support, but it's not the most significant factor unless combined with other issues. Medium weight.\n\nGED certificate: Having a GED might indicate some level of education, which is positive, but he's enrolled in college, so maybe this is offsetting. Low weight.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year: Employment can reduce recidivism by providing stability and income, so low risk here. However, since he has prior arrest, that's a conflict. Medium weight because the job count isn't high but there might be other issues conflicting with it.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in past four years: Drug abuse is a strong risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to unstable behavior and self-harm. High weight here.\n\nFelt down during the month: Emotional distress or low mood can contribute to substance use, which we've already noted. This adds to the high weight of drug use.\n\nAt young age lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in urban area: Living with one parent might offer some stability but living in an urban area could have its own issues like higher stress or crime. Medium weight because it's not as significant as other factors.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life: Lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, especially if the person turns to other substances or has unstable relationships. High weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: The key risk factors are prior arrest, drug use, and belief in a lack of divine support. The presence of a GED might help, but his job count isn't high enough to offset everything else. So I'd lean towards a higher confidence in recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which generally reduces the likelihood of immediate recidivism due to increased life experience and stability.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being White does not inherently indicate a higher risk but can be influenced by other factors like prior convictions or living circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"At 5 feet 7 inches, height does not directly correlate with recidivism rates without additional context about health or behavior.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"140 lbs is within a healthy range and does not indicate substance abuse or other risk factors related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 years old, though never married, can sometimes be associated with higher stress levels that might contribute indirectly but isn't the primary factor here.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests some level of education which is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year, which can indicate stability, though prior arrest might suggest potential issues with employment history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in past four years, which significantly increases the risk of substance abuse and related behavioral issues that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Feeling Low\", \"high\", \"Felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up, which might correlate with substance use or other destabilizing factors contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area.
