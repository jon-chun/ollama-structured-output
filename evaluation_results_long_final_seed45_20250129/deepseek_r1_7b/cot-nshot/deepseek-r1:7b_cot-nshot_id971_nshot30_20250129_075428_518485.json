    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That\u2019s one arrest. I think an arrest without a conviction can still be a significant risk factor because it shows past behavior that might lead to more issues.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs, which is on the lighter side. Weight doesn\u2019t directly indicate much about recidivism unless combined with other factors like health or substance use, but here he has a GED and is in college, so maybe that mitigates some risk.\n\nNever been married and living alone\u2014being an only child can sometimes lead to higher stress, which might correlate with more issues. But it's not directly related to recidivism unless there are family dynamics we don't know about.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. A GED can be beneficial as it shows some educational attainment, but being in college suggests he's motivated to improve his situation. So maybe this factor isn't too high in risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year\u2014job experience is usually positive for recidivism because having a stable job can lead to better life choices. But if he lost his job recently or it's unstable, that might be a concern. Here, just one job seems okay.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a strong risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further complications like health issues or substance abuse problems which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nFeeling down and not able to cheer himself up\u2014this is a big red flag. Emotional distress without any signs of attempt to improve could indicate deeper issues, possibly related to mental health or family dysfunction. This can increase the risk of engaging in negative behaviors again.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Being raised by one's biological parent might have its pros and cons, but if there are any underlying issues like neglect or abuse, that could be problematic. However, since we don't know the specifics, I'll consider it as moderate risk.\n\nHe considers God to have nothing to do with his personal life\u2014this could indicate a lack of spiritual support which some studies suggest might not provide the same level of emotional stability compared to having religious support, but again, without more context, it's hard to quantify.\n\nPutting this all together: The main factors that stand out are the arrest, drug use, and feeling down. These seem to be higher risk indicators. Even though he has a GED and is in college, which are positive, the negative factors might outweigh them. So I would lean towards predicting \"NO\" but with lower confidence because not all negatives always lead to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest without a conviction, which can indicate past behavior that may correlate with future issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, particularly marijuana, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to health complications and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling down without attempting to improve suggests potential mental health issues that may contribute to negative behaviors or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with the biological mother in a household of three, while urban, could indicate family dynamics that may not provide adequate support for positive behavior changes.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrolled\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college indicates some educational attainments and motivation toward improvement which can be mitigating factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
