    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: He's 21 years old. From the examples, people around that age often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and life experiences. So I'd assign a high weight to his age being young.\n\nNext, criminal history: He has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a moderate risk factor compared to multiple convictions or active criminal behavior. So medium weight here.\n\nWeight and height: 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. These aren't extreme numbers, so the weight doesn't seem to be an issue. I'll give this a low weight.\n\nMarital status: Never married living alone. Marital stability is often linked to lower recidivism because of better support systems, but since he's single, that might slightly increase risk. So maybe medium?\n\nGED certificate and education: He has a GED and is enrolled in college. Education typically reduces the likelihood of rearrest, so high weight.\n\nNumber of jobs: Held 1 job during the year. Having some employment can provide stability, so low weight here.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse can increase recidivism risk, especially if it's recent or frequent. Medium weight.\n\nMental health: Felt down for a month. Emotional distress is linked to higher recidivism rates because of possible substance abuse or other issues. Medium weight.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 3. Small households can offer support, but living with the mother might also have implications if there were disciplinary actions. Maybe medium weight.\n\nGeographic location: Urban area. Urban environments often have higher recidivism rates due to various social and economic factors. High weight here.\n\nGod's role: He doesn't believe in a personal God affecting his life. Some studies suggest that existential factors can play a role in recidivism, so maybe low weight since he's not seeking spiritual help which could offer additional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, criminal history (not convicted), and mental health issues. The moderate ones include household size and living situation, while education is strong protective. I'll predict based on these to lean towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The person is 21 years old, which is relatively young and often associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited life experience and skill development.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"He has one arrest but no conviction.
