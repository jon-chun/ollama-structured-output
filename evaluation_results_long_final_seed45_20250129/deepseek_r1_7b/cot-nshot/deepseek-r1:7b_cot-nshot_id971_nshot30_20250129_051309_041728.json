    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this person based on the given risk factors. Let's start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. That's quite young, which might be a negative factor because younger individuals often have less life experience and might not have developed as many coping mechanisms. So that could be a low or medium weight.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Conviction history is definitely a red flag for recidivism. The more convictions, the higher the chance of getting caught again. So this should probably be a high weight factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like this directly affect recidivism unless there's something about his past that relates to his weight or health, but nothing in the factors suggests that. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, which might contribute to substance use or other issues that could lead to recidivism. But since he's never married, it's not as clear-cut. Maybe medium weight.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Having a GED is generally associated with higher chances of completing education and entering the workforce, which can help reduce recidivism. However, being in college might indicate he's trying to improve his situation, so maybe this factor isn't as strong. Maybe low weight.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Job experience can be positive because having a job often leads to better economic stability and reduces the likelihood of needing to rely on incarceration for basic needs. So perhaps medium weight here.\n\nDrug use: he has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is strongly linked to recidivism, especially if it's recent or frequent. Since he used marijuana recently, this should be a high weight factor.\n\nHe felt down during the past month and couldn't cheer himself up. Emotional distress can contribute to substance abuse, unstable relationships, etc., which can all lead to more opportunities for recidivism. So that's another high weight factor.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Living with a parent might provide support, but it could also mean living in an environment without supervision or proper care if there are issues elsewhere. The fact that he considers God to have no influence on his life adds some instability. So maybe medium weight.\n\nNow, putting it all together: high factors include convictions, drug use, and feeling down. Medium factors like age, living alone, GED enrollment, job holding. Low or none for the rest.\n\nSo considering all these, I think he's at a higher risk of rearrest because of his arrest history, drug use, and emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 21 years old, which may indicate less life experience, contributing to lower stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"A single conviction history increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at this age with no previous marriage doesn't necessarily correlate with high recidivism risk without additional factors like substance use or instability.\"),\n    (\"ED**: GED and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and enrolling in college can positively influence job prospects, potentially reducing recidivism risk.
