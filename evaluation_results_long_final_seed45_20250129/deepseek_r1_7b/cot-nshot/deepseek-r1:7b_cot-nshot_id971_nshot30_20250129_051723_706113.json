    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this case based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. This seems like a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to recidivism. So that's a high weight.\n\nHe's White, which in some studies shows a slight disparity, but here it might not be as impactful unless there's specific data indicating otherwise. Maybe medium weight.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs at 5'7\". Since he has a GED and is enrolled in college, education level is good, so that should lower the risk. That's probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone, which might indicate some social instability, but considering his other factors, maybe medium weight.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase recidivism, especially if it's recent or frequent. So high weight here.\n\nHe feels depressed for some time now, which could be a sign of underlying mental health issues. That should also be high weight.\n\nAt 21, he was living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and different social environments that might not be as stabilizing. So medium weight here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which could affect his motivation to change behavior or seek support, increasing recidivism risk\u2014so high weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), education (low), living alone (medium), drug use (high), depression (high), urban living (medium), and lack of faith (high). The positives are outweighed by the negatives. So I would predict a high risk, leaning towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_convicted\", \"high\", \"Past arrest history increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age_group\", \"low\", \"21 years is within a typical age range for entering the workforce and may indicate responsible behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED completion coupled with college enrollment suggests good educational support and potential for positive change.\"),\n    (\"single_parent_residing\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially in urban settings, can contribute to social isolation and increased risk factors.\"),\n    (\"drug use_past4years\", \"high\", \"Drug use history is a strong indicator of past behavior that may persist into recidivism.\"),\n    (\"current_depression_sentiment\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression can lead to substance abuse and decreased motivation for positive actions.\"),\n    (\"household_size_youth_residing\", \"medium\", \"Small household size in urban areas may indicate less support network, contributing to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religion_no Belief\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious belief may influence motivation towards positive behavior changes or seeking help.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
