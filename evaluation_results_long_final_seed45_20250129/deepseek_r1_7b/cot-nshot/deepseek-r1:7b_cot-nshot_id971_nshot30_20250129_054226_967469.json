    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He has been arrested once and convicted. His weight is 140 lbs, which isn't too concerning unless combined with other factors. He's never married and living alone, which might indicate some social or personal issues.\n\nHe holds a GED and is enrolled in a 4-year college. That's positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and outcomes. He's worked one job during the year; job experience is good for recidivism rates as it shows he can maintain a stable lifestyle without relying on incarceration.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, within the past four years could be a red flag but might not directly correlate with rearrest if he's making positive steps now. His recent feelings of low mood or depression might suggest underlying mental health issues that could affect his behavior.\n\nAt 21, living alone and having lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014city environments can have higher stress levels but also offer opportunities. His belief that God has no influence on his personal matters is interesting; it might indicate he's more independent or perhaps less prone to seeking help for personal issues.\n\nNow, considering the examples provided earlier: similar profiles with some overlapping risk factors like arrest history, lack of marriage, living alone, education, and drug use have shown mixed outcomes. Some ended up rearrested, others didn't. The key differentiators in those cases were often the type of support systems they had or their proactive steps towards betterment.\n\nGiven all these points, I think this person has several mitigating factors like GED, college enrollment, positive job history, and living situation that suggest a lower risk. However, the recent drug use and feelings of low mood shouldn't be ignored entirely as they could indicate potential issues. \n\nBalancing all these, I'd lean towards predicting \"NO\" for rearrest but with some uncertainty because without more proactive support or significant life changes, there might still be risks. So, my confidence is around 30% that he won't rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a single arrest and conviction, which can indicate past instability but also shows some maturity in handling legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has used marijuana within the past four years.
