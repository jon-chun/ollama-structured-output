    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out this case step by step. So, the person is a 19-year-old Black female who was arrested once but not convicted. She weighs 190 lbs and is 5 feet 6 inches tall. She's never married and living alone. She has a high school diploma and is in college for two years. She worked one job last year without any drug use and isn't feeling depressed lately. Her young age was spent with her biological mother in an urban household of five, and she believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor from the examples given to see how this case aligns.\n\n1. **Age**: She's 19, which is close to 20. In the examples, people around that age often had higher recidivism rates, so her age might be a medium risk.\n   \n2. **Arrest Record**: She has one arrest but no conviction. More arrests usually increase the chance of rearrest, so this could be high risk.\n\n3. **Education Level**: She has a diploma and is in college. Higher education typically lowers recidivism, so this is low risk.\n\n4. **Employment**: She's employed full-time during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so this is low.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: No drug use in past four years, which is very good for low risk.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married might mean she's focused on herself, reducing risk. But sometimes being single can lead to different issues, maybe medium.\n\n7. **Household Size at Age**: She lived with her mother in a household of five. Smaller households often correlate with lower recidivism, so maybe low.\n\n8. **Living Alone**: She's living alone now, which could be a risk factor because isolation might contribute to depression or other issues leading to recidivism.\n\n9. **Religious Belief**: Believes in God, which is protective against some recidivistic behaviors, so this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest record (high), living alone (medium), household size at age (low) and maybe her current isolation could be a factor. However, her education, employment, no drug use, and belief in God are strong protective factors. So the overall prediction might lean towards NO with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"She is 19 years old, which is close to 20, often associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"One arrest but no conviction can increase the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Employed full-time during the year further reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is a strong protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, but could potentially face different challenges.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18+\", \"low\", \"Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, which may correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone Currently\", \"medium\", \"Living alone now might contribute to potential isolation issues.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, which is protective against some recidivistic behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```",
