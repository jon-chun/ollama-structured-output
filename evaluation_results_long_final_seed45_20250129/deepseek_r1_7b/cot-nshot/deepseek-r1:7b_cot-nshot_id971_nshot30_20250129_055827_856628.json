    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. Let me break down his risk factors based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with a conviction had varying outcomes. Some went to YES, others NO. But since it's just one conviction, I might give that medium weight because it's significant but not life-altering.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes help in getting better opportunities, so maybe lower risk, but being in college could indicate proactive steps, which might be positive\u2014so perhaps low to medium.\n\nLiving alone doesn't seem to be an issue; many examples live alone without recidivism issues. So that's probably low weight.\n\nHe has a job history of one job in the past year. That seems stable, so maybe low risk factor here.\n\nDrug use is only marijuana in the past four years. That's a minor offense compared to other drug uses, which might affect the risk\u2014so perhaps medium weight since it's present but not severe.\n\nFeeling down for some time could indicate mental health issues or stress, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk. So that's probably high weight.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban areas might have different dynamics, but the small household size suggests maybe lower risk\u2014so low weight.\n\nConsidering God has no influence on his life\u2014he might be more self-reliant, which could reduce recidivism risk, so perhaps medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Arrest history is medium, GED and college enrollment are low to medium, job history is low, minor drug use is medium, feeling down is high, living with mom in small urban area is low, and God's influence is medium. \n\nI think the main factors pulling him towards higher risk are the arrest history and recent drug use. The other factors are either neutral or mitigating. So I'd lean towards a NO prediction but might have lower confidence because of the arrest and drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which can impact recidivism risk but is not necessarily terminal.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \" possession of a GED and current enrollment in college may indicate proactive steps towards betterment, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \" living alone is common among individuals with no significant living arrangements history, which does not typically contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \" holding one job for the past year suggests a stable income and employment situation, reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \" recent marijuana use, while minor, can still be a contributing factor in recidivism risk compared to non-offenders.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Symptom\", \"high\", \" feeling down or lacking motivation for some time is a significant indicator of potential mental health issues, which can affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \" living with biological parents in a household of three indicates a stable and supportive environment, contributing to lower risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"medium\", \" no religious involvement suggests greater self-reliance, which may reduce recidivism risk but is not entirely mitigating given other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
