    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White, arrested once but not convicted. He weighs 140 lbs, stands at 5 feet 7 inches. Never married, living alone. Has a GED and enrolled in college. Worked one job, used marijuana, felt down recently. At his young age, lived with his biological mom in a household of three in an urban area. Believes God has no role in his life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, I see that factors like previous convictions, living situation alone, drug use, and family environment are significant. \n\nFirst, he was arrested once but not convicted\u2014so maybe lower risk there? But being White might affect it differently based on the data in the examples. In example 10, a White person with similar factors had a YES outcome, so maybe his race isn't as impactful here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That's a point towards low risk, but in some cases, it can also be a risk factor. But in the examples, this didn't lead to a high recidivism rate often.\n\nHis GED: in example 14, someone with a GED had a YES outcome. His enrollment in college might be positive if he's making progress, so maybe that lowers the risk. He did have one job which is good.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana. In most examples, even recent drug use was associated with higher recidivism, like example 4 and 20 both had marijuana users with YES outcomes.\n\nLiving with his biological mom in a small household: in some cases, that was linked to lower risk, but not always. Like in example 13, a similar situation led to NO. So maybe this factor is medium.\n\nBelief in God\u2014most examples where he believed in God had NO recidivism outcomes except when combined with other factors like low education or family issues. This might be a protective factor, so perhaps low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: previous arrest (non-convicted) is probably medium; living alone is low; GED and college enrollment are high; one job is positive; marijuana use is medium; small household with mom is medium; belief in God is low. \n\nSo the overall factors would lean towards a lower risk, but I'm not entirely sure because even some of these positives can be outweighed by other negatives like drug use or living situation.\n\nWait, in example 26, someone similar to this had a YES outcome despite being White and with a GED. So maybe there's no strong pattern based on race here. Maybe his GED is more important than his race.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I might lean towards low risk but not extremely confident because some factors like drug use can still influence it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The person was arrested once but not convicted, which may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to those with prior convictions.
