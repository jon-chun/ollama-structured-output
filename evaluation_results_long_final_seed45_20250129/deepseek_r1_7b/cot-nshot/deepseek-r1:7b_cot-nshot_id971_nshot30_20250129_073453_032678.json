    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old male who's White. Let me go through his risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor\u2014conviction history definitely increases the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs at 5'7\", which is within the normal weight range for his height, so no issue there.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014while living alone isn't necessarily bad, being single can sometimes lead to higher risk factors like substance abuse or lack of support.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually helps reduce recidivism, especially with ongoing education and potentially better job opportunities.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is good for stability but having more job experience might be even better.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years\u2014drug use can contribute to mental health issues, which may affect his ability to function or find employment.\n\nFeeling down for a month could indicate underlying mental health issues, maybe depression or anxiety. This is concerning and could lead to more substance abuse or unstable living situations.\n\nAt 21 with a young age of living at home\u2014this might suggest he's dependent on his parents for support, which can be problematic as he grows older if not independent.\n\nLiving with biological mother in an urban area of household size 3. Urban areas often have higher stress levels and crime rates, which could affect his mental health and stability.\n\nBelieves God has no role\u2014this might indicate a lack of faith or spirituality, which some studies suggest can be linked to substance abuse and lower self-esteem.\n\nPutting it all together: Conviction history is high risk. Education and being in college are positive indicators but not enough to outweigh the negatives like drug use, mental health issues, living situation, and lack of spiritual support.\n\nI think his overall risk is medium because while there are mitigating factors (education, being in college), several risk factors point towards a moderate chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Arrested once and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no dependents can be isolating and may contribute to substance abuse or instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years; while this is concerning, it does not necessarily indicate heavy substance abuse which could influence stability but doesn't directly correlate with rearrest as strongly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Hold one job during the year, which can provide some stability but may lack diversity or advancement potential that could reduce recidivism risk over time.\"),\n    (\"Mental health indicators\", \"high\", \"Felt down for a month; this could signal underlying mental health issues that may affect behavior and stability over time, increasing the risk of substance abuse or strained relationships which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living with parents\", \"medium\", \"Lived at home at 21 years old; while this provides support in early life, it doesn't directly correlate with rearrest as strongly as other factors but may indicate potential dependency issues over time.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
