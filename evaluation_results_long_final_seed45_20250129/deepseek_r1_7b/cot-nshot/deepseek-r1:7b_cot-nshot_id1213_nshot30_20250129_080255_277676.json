    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female. I'll start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is quite young. Young adults are generally at lower risk of rearrest compared to older individuals because they're still developing their skills and stability. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Being arrested even without a conviction can have some negative impact on her chances, but since she hasn't actually been convicted, the immediate risk is probably lower than someone with multiple arrests or convictions. I'd rate this as medium risk because one arrest could still influence her behavior.\n\nHer weight is 190 lbs, which is within a healthy range for her height of 5'6\". Being underweight or overweight can sometimes be linked to health issues that might affect recidivism, but she's at a normal weight here. So low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Unstable living situations can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to factors like homelessness or financial instability, but since she's living alone without any indication of such issues, this might be a low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Having education is generally protective against recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and higher earning potential, reducing the chance of ending up in prison again. So that's a strong protective factor\u2014low risk.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Job experience, especially with some stability, is positive for recidivism. One job might provide some sense of purpose and financial stability. Still, it's better than no work at all, so maybe medium or low depending on the job nature. I'll consider this as medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and isn't feeling depressed. Substance abuse and mental health issues are major predictors of recidivism. Her lack of drug use and good mental state are positive indicators\u2014very low risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living with multiple family members could indicate a stable home environment if all the people involved are supportive. However, living with too many people without enough supervision can be risky. Since it's specified as her biological mother and it's an urban area, maybe she had some support\u2014so perhaps low risk.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal life. This is a strong positive factor because religious involvement often correlates with better moral values and higher self-esteem, which reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior again. So this would be very protective, contributing to low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: low, medium, low, low, low, medium, low, low, high (protective). Considering all these factors, her overall risk is probably low but not nonexistent. However, since she's 19 and has no prior convictions despite an arrest, there might be some residual risk. I'd lean towards low confidence in rearrest because of the protective factors outweighing the potential negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which generally reduces the likelihood of rearrest as they are still developing their skills and stability.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which could influence her behavior but doesn't guarantee higher risk compared to others with similar records.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"At 190 lbs for her height (5'6\"), she is within a healthy weight range, reducing potential health-related issues linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without significant instability increases safety and reduces risk factors associated with shared living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which provides educational opportunities reducing reoffending tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year offers some stability but may not provide extensive experience or skills that could influence rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates a clean slate, which is protective against recidivism triggers.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed and using no drugs suggests good mental health, further reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area may indicate some level of stability if the household is supportive.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Strong belief in God associated with positive moral values and self-esteem, which are significant protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
