    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each of his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might be a medium risk because being arrested could indicate prior issues that led to his incarceration.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Weight-wise, it doesn't seem out of the ordinary unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes positively influence his chances, but being in college might show he's committed to improving himself, so maybe lower risk from this factor.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014maybe some social support issues? Not sure if that directly affects recidivism rates.\n\nHe holds a job during the year; employment is generally protective against rearrest.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana but hasn't relapsed recently. Past use might be a concern, though not severe.\n\nFeeling down for a month could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors, which can affect his ability to reintegrate and may increase risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Living with the biological family is usually protective against recidivism because it provides stability.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life\u2014could indicate lack of religious support or perhaps more autonomy, which might be positive but could also vary based on other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium risk overall because he's got a GED and college enrollment, but some negative factors like past arrest, drug use, and emotional state. The living situation with his mother is good though.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has prior arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, which could indicate potential for recidivism, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, it might not have had a significant impact.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana)\", \"low\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, but there's no mention of substance abuse or relapse, so it may not be a significant risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"He reported feeling down for some time, which could indicate underlying issues that might affect his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of 3 provides a stable living environment, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests commitment to improving himself and may positively influence reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"He has held a job during the year, which is generally protective against rearrest as employment can provide financial stability and purpose.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
