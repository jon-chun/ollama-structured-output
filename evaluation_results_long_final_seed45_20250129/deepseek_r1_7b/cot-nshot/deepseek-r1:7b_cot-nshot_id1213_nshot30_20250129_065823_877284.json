    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which might be a positive sign as she's relatively young and may still be in school or job-seeking phase. But since it's about recidivism within three years, maybe not too impactful.\n\nShe has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. Only one offense can sometimes indicate that she's managed to avoid serious punishment, which is good. But the number of prior offenses is low here, so maybe her risk isn't high from that angle.\n\nHer weight and height: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. Those aren't extremely concerning unless there are other health issues, but nothing jumps out as problematic here. Weight might relate to substance use sometimes, but she hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's a non-issue.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which is stable living situation. Unstable living can be a risk factor, but her current situation seems okay.\n\nHigh school diploma: That's above average education, which generally correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism. So this is a protective factor.\n\nEnrolled in a 2-year college: Continuing education is usually beneficial for employment and stability. This is another positive sign.\n\nShe held one job during the year: Employment history can be a good indicator of future stability. If she was employed, that might indicate she's capable of supporting herself.\n\nNo drug use in past four years: Complete abstinence is a strong negative risk factor. She avoids the complications and potential recidivism associated with substance abuse.\n\nNot felt depressed in the past month: Emotional well-being is linked to lower recidivism rates. If she's mentally stable, that's another positive.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at age 17. A larger household could imply more supervision or potential for dependency, but since she's currently living alone and has good support now, it might have less impact than if she were still dependent on them.\n\nConsidering her faith that God is involved in her life: This can be a protective factor as spirituality often correlates with better self-discipline and moral behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Most risk factors are either protective or neutral. No significant positives, but nothing strong enough to indicate high risk either. She has no active substance use, stable employment history, and good living situation now. So her risk of rearrest seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19 years old, which might be a positive indicator as she could still be in school or job-seeking phase, reducing the likelihood of immediate recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no convictions, indicating she may have avoided serious punishment and managed to stay on track with her behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight is 190 lbs.
