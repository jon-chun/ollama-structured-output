    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Being younger can be a mitigating factor because she's closer to being an adult and has fewer life experiences that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. One arrest without a conviction might indicate she either faced it but didn't get charged or there wasn't enough evidence. This is probably a low risk factor since it's a minor offense with no formal charges.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 190 lbs. I don't see how physical size relates to recidivism, so this might be a neutral or low factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation, but in some cases, it's stable. Not sure about the weight here yet.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually reduces recidivism risk because it provides opportunities. This should be a high factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment is positive as it can lead to financial stability, so this is probably low or medium depending on her job's nature.\n\nNo drug use and no depression in the past month. These are strong indicators of good mental health and substance use prevention, so high risk reduction here.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household size 5 in an urban area. Urban settings can sometimes have higher crime rates but also offer more opportunities. However, living with family might provide support, reducing risk.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her life. This positive belief could reduce stress and mental health issues, so high protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors that contribute to low risk are education, employment, no drug use, and positive spiritual involvement. Factors like being 19 and living alone might slightly increase risk, but the overall picture leans towards low risk. I think her probability of rearrest is lower than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19, which is relatively young and may not be a strong risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating no serious criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant impact as physical attributes typically do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone is a neutral factor without additional context about living conditions or stability.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which can positively influence future employment and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year; limited employment may not provide significant support for long-term goals but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of substance abuse prevention and low risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental health which correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"neutral\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 5 may offer some support but doesn't inherently increase risk without additional context about living conditions or family dynamics.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"high\", \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, which can reduce stress and mental health issues, contributing positively to recidivism risk reduction.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
