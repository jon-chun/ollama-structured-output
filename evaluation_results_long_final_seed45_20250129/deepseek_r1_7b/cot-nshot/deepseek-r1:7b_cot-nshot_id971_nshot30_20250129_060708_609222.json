    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors for this 21-year-old male and predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is quite young, but since we're predicting rearrest within three years, that might not be a significant factor here unless there are other indicators of low risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted\u2014so that\u2019s a moderate offense history. Convictions can increase the risk of recidivism, so this should probably be weighted as high.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs at 5'7\". That's below average, but unless there are other factors like chronic health issues or substance abuse, it might not directly impact recidivism much on its own. However, considering he has a drug history, maybe it's more relevant.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, so that might be a low to medium factor depending on other factors like support networks or substance use.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and is enrolled in college\u2014higher education typically correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this should be weighted as high because it's a positive indicator.\n\nHe\u2019s held one job during the year. Employment can provide stability, but if he's facing unemployment or underutilized, that might be low. However, since he has education and is in college, maybe his employment situation isn't a huge concern here.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) and feelings of low mood for a month\u2014these are concerning signs. Drug use can increase recidivism risk because it can lead to more substance-related issues or further legal problems if used again.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three, which is an urban setting. Living with the biological parent might indicate a stable environment compared to other factors like multiple living arrangements, but it's still a point to consider for stability.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal events could potentially reduce religious support, which some studies suggest can act as a protective factor against recidivism. So this might be a low or medium factor.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors include convictions and education. Medium factors are living situation (though he's alone), drug use, and employment status. Low factors are his young age and belief in God not helping him.\n\nConsidering the high weight of conviction and GED, which usually predict lower recidivism, I would lean towards a prediction that this person might not rearrest within three years. However, other moderate risk factors like drug use should temper that prediction slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has oneConviction\", \"high\", \"Conviction history increases the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates past legal issues which can be a predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"GED_Certificate\", \"high\", \" possession of a GED is associated with lower recidivism rates due to better educational and employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Drug_Use_History\", \"medium\", \" Drug use history, particularly marijuana, is strongly linked to higher recidivism risk as it can lead to substance abuse issues and legal problems if reused.\"),\n    (\"Living_Solo\", \"low\", \" Living alone may indicate a lack of support network which could contribute to higher stress levels or substance use issues but his GED and education provide some stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment_Status\", \"medium\", \" employment status, though held one job, is in college which suggests pursuit of further education potentially leading to better job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"Religious_Attachment\", \"low\", \" Belief in God not influencing personal events may reduce the protective effect typically associated with religious support against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
