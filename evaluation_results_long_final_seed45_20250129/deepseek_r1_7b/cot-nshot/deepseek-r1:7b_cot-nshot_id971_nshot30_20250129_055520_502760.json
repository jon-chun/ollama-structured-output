    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let's break down all the risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. The examples mostly have people around that age, but some are a bit younger or older. I don't know if there's an explicit rule about age affecting rearrest rates, so maybe I'll assign it low weight because it doesn't seem like a major factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, having one arrest was common, so this might not be super high risk but contributes to recidivism. Maybe medium weight since it's present but not multiple arrests.\n\nRacial identifier is White. I don't think race alone makes someone more or less likely to recidivate based on these examples, so low weight here.\n\nWeight: 140 lbs, which is below the recommended BMI for men. The examples have a mix of weights, some lower, some higher. Maybe this doesn't heavily influence rearrest rates, so low weight.\n\nLiving alone: Yes, he's living alone in an urban area. This was a factor in several examples leading to recidivism, so that's high risk.\n\nGED certificate and enrolled in college: Having a GED can sometimes correlate with lower rearrest rates because it might indicate more commitment, but being enrolled suggests he's actively trying to improve. Maybe medium weight since both factors are present but not necessarily strong indicators on their own.\n\nEmployment history: Held 1 job during the year. In some examples, having a job was associated with lower recidivism, so this is low risk here.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in past four years. Some examples have drug use and higher recidivism rates, so maybe medium weight because it's present but not severe.\n\nMood: Felt down for the past month. This could be a sign of mental health issues, which might increase recidivism risk. So high weight here.\n\nFamily living situation: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or stress, so this is medium to high risk depending on how the examples handled similar situations.\n\nGod's involvement: He says God has nothing to do with his personal issues. This might indicate he's more likely to engage with other support systems, which could be a positive factor, but it also shows he doesn't rely on religion for motivation, possibly making him more susceptible to other negative factors. So maybe medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: The main risk factors are living alone (high), drug use (medium), mood (high). Other factors like GED and college enrollment might slightly lower the risk but aren't as impactful. So overall, this person is on the higher end of recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the individual has several high-risk factors such as living alone in an urban area and recent drug use, which significantly contribute to his likelihood of rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Age is 21, similar to many cases analyzed, no significant impact on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and conviction, contributing but not a major factor.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White, no specific racial impact in examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"140 lbs, below BMI threshold, minor influence on health metrics.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone in urban area, significant risk indicator from examples.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"GED and enrolled in college, somewhat mitigating but not dominant factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"One job during the year, generally positive indicator but here neutralized by other factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use recent past four years, moderate risk contributor.\"),\n    (\"Mood\", \"high\", \"Felt down recently, significant emotional distress factor in examples.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Household size 3 in urban area, some examples showed similar outcomes.\"),\n    (\"God's Role\", \"medium\", \"No reliance on God for motivation but no indication of other support systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
