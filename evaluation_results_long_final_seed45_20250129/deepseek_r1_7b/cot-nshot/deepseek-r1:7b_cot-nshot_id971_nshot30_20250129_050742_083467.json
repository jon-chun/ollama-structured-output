    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this person's risk factors for rearrest recidivism. Let me start by going through each factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. In the examples, most people around that age had either a high or medium weight. Since he's young, maybe it doesn't contribute much to recidivism risk. So I might give this low weight.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That seems significant because prior convictions are a big indicator of recidivism. Looking at the examples, people with similar factors tend to have high or medium weights on prior offenses. So this would be high weight.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs, which is about average for his height. I don't see how weight affects recidivism directly in these examples, so maybe low weight here.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Marital status isn't a strong indicator unless it's tied to other factors like support networks. Since he's single and living alone, perhaps medium weight because being alone can increase stress but not sure if that translates directly.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. GEDs are generally considered positive factors as they indicate some education, which might help with job opportunities. Being enrolled in college suggests commitment to improving his situation, so maybe high or medium? In the examples, people with similar education had lower recidivism rates, so perhaps this should be high.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency and higher risk of recidivism. In examples, joblessness was a medium factor. Having one job might mitigate some risks but still could be low weight since it's positive but not a strong indicator.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism. The example with similar drug use had high weights, so this should definitely be high weight.\n\nFeeling down and unable to cheer during the month. This indicates emotional distress, which can affect mental health and ability to reintegrate into society, leading to higher risk. So probably high weight here.\n\nYoung age at 21: As mentioned earlier, it's a bit of an outlier but might not be as significant as other factors like prior convictions or drug use. Maybe low because being young doesn't necessarily mean more likely unless there are other negative factors.\n\nLiving situation alone and in urban area with his biological mother. Prior examples showed that living with parents, especially in supportive environments, can reduce risk. Being alone increases risk, so this might be medium weight.\n\nGod's role: He says nothing about God. In the examples, those who acknowledged religious support had lower recidivism rates, but since he doesn't mention it, maybe low or medium? Not sure if acknowledging religion affects much without that information. Maybe low since no strong indication of religious involvement.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- Prior Conviction: High\n- GED and College: High\n- Drug Use: High\n- Emotional Distress: High\n- Young Age: Low (but maybe should consider)\n- Living Alone: Medium\n\nWait, considering the young age might still be a factor if combined with other negatives. But overall, his prior conviction is a strong indicator, along with drug use and emotional distress.\n\nSo I think the high weight factors will pull the prediction towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"His being arrested once and convicted significantly increases the risk of recidivism as seen in similar cases where such factors were present.\"),\n    (\"GED and College\", \"high\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college indicates a commitment to education, which may help reduce recidivism risk, but it should be weighed against other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which correlates with higher recidivism rates as seen in similar cases.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and unable to find joy can impact mental health, increasing the likelihood of negative behaviors that may lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stress and isolation, which are known to contribute to higher risk of recidivism despite not being directly tied to other factors like marital status in previous cases.\"),\n    (\"Young Age (21)\", \"low\", \"While age can be a variable, at 21, the individual is still relatively young, but this factor alone may not significantly increase risk without other negative indicators.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
