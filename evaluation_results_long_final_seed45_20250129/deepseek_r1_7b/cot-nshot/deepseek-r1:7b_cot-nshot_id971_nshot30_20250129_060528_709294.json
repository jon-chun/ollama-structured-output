    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the provided risk factors. Let me start by breaking down each factor and assigning a weight.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, 21 years old. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can be a red flag because living arrangements are linked to recidivism. People who live alone might have less support systems and could be more susceptible to stressors or triggers that lead to further issues. That's another high-weight factor.\n\nHis educational status is a GED and he's enrolled in a 4-year college. Education, especially with a GED, can reduce recidivism risks. However, being enrolled might indicate he's actively working towards betterment, which could lower the risk but isn't as strong as prior convictions. I'll rate this medium.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone, so no partner to provide emotional support or stability. That's another high-weight factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years, which can be a sign of drug use issues. Drug use itself isn't directly linked but can indicate other behavioral issues that might contribute to recidivism. So medium weight here.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood or depression are concerning because emotional distress is a precursor to criminal behavior. That's high weight as it suggests potential stress or mental health issues affecting his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHe was raised in a household of size 3, which isn't too large but could still be stable enough not to contribute much risk. Maybe this factor is low because smaller households often provide more support and less risk compared to larger ones.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal issues. This lack of religious support might mean fewer social networks or community resources, increasing his chances of struggling in society again. So high weight here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, prior conviction is the strongest indicator pointing towards a high risk. The living situation and lack of marriage also contribute significantly. Drug use and recent emotional issues further amplify the risk. On the other hand, having a GED and being enrolled in college mitigates some risk but isn't enough to lower it to a low level overall.\n\nSo putting this all together, I think the person has a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction for a crime, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism as reoffending is common among those with criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and increased stress, which are known contributors to mental health issues and substance abuse, both of which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"While having a GED is beneficial, being enrolled in college suggests active efforts towards betterment but does not fully offset the risk associated with prior convictions and other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Never Married, Alone Living\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a spouse can lead to emotional instability and a lack of support system, further increasing the likelihood of experiencing stressors that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is associated with behavioral issues and health problems which can contribute to negative outcomes but does not directly indicate prior criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Recent Low Mood/Depression\", \"high\", \"Experiencing low mood or depression for a significant portion of the month is concerning as it may signal underlying mental health issues that could affect decision-making and relationships, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Household Size 3 (Urban)\", \"low\", \"A household size of 3 can still provide a sense of stability and support, reducing some of the associated risks compared to larger households which might offer more resources but also potentially more social pressure.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God for Personal Issues\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious involvement or belief after experiencing personal issues may result in fewer social networks or community support systems, increasing the likelihood of engaging in similar behaviors again.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
