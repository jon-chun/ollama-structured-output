    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for the given case and then predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female Black, arrested once but not convicted. She weighs 5'6\" and 190 lbs. Single, living alone with a diploma and enrolled in college. Worked one job recently. No drug use, no recent depression. Lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Believes God affects her life.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- Age: 19 is young; maybe low risk?\n- Arrests: 1 time but not convicted\u2014medium? No conviction might lower risk.\n- Weight: 5'6\"/190\u2014within normal range, so low.\n- Single, living alone: Low risk since she's single and not in a household with others. No kids either.\n- Education: High school diploma and college\u2014that\u2019s good; high education is usually protective against recidivism.\n- Employment: 1 job recently\u2014some work experience but maybe not significant for rearrest.\n- Drugs: Never used, so low risk.\n- Depression: No recent feelings of depression\u2014good sign.\n- Family: Lived with mother in a household size 5. Urban area; family support might help.\n\nHer belief in God could be protective or a strength.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are positive except maybe the single living alone and lack of family beyond her mom. But overall, she seems low risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is a relatively young age associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, reducing the chances of rearrest compared to those with convictions.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"She weighs 5 feet 6 inches and 190 lbs, within a healthy range, indicating good physical health which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Single living alone reduces stressors and support systems that could potentially lead to substance abuse or criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She has held one job during the year; employment can provide stability and reduce opportunities for substance abuse or illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drugs\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of sobriety and reduced risk factors associated with substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression, which can be an indicator of mental stability and lower likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of five with her biological mother, though this could vary based on family dynamics and support network which might influence behavior but is not the most significant risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which provides education and opportunities that can lead to better job prospects and reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Her belief in God may offer some protective factors but does not directly influence substance abuse or criminal behavior risk as significantly as other factors like education and employment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
