    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a GED certificate. From the examples, people with a GED often have lower recidivism rates because they're more likely to get employed or further education. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe's been convicted once but is currently on probation. Convictions are bad; this would probably increase his chances of rearrest. So high risk here.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs, living alone with no spouse. Weight doesn't directly affect recidivism, but living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, though in the examples, most people were single without issues. Maybe medium risk because it's one factor among others.\n\nHe has no ties to his ex-partner now, so that's not an issue here. He's attending college for 4 years\u2014college attendance usually leads to better outcomes, so low risk.\n\nHe holds a job during the year but hasn't felt employable before. Unemployment can affect recidivism, but since he has a GED and is in college, this might be mitigated. Medium risk here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) isn't a crime but can impact mental health. The examples didn't mention many people with marijuana use relapsing, so maybe low or medium. But the feeling of emptiness could increase stress, so maybe medium.\n\nHe felt very down during the month and considered talking to someone. That's a sign of emotional strain which might relate to substance abuse issues\u2014so maybe high risk because mental health issues can lead to substance use problems.\n\n living with his biological mother in a household of 3 is okay; no indication of domestic issues, so low risk there.\n\nNo prior family issues beyond that, so not much impact. God's influence on his life\u2014he says nothing, so neutral but perhaps low as it doesn't contribute negatively.\n\nPutting it all together: Conviction is high, GED and college are positive. Drug use with emotional strain might tip it towards medium to high. Considering the examples, convictions dominate, so outcome would lean towards high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on his risk factors, especially his prior conviction, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"ged certificate\", \"low\", \"He has a GED which is associated with lower recidivism rates as seen in examples where individuals with similar backgrounds did not relapse frequently.\"),\n    (\"conviction once\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction, especially one that resulted in probation, increases the likelihood of reoffending as seen in similar cases where such factors were present.\"),\n    (\"living alone, no spouse, single parent\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher rearrest rates but may be a contributing factor if instability is suspected, though it was not explicitly mentioned in the examples that this was an issue for others in similar situations.\"),\n    (\"college enrollment 4 years\", \"low\", \"Attending college for four years suggests a commitment to education and better job prospects, which are associated with lower recidivism rates as shown in the examples where educational attainment was linked to positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\" employed during the year but not feel employable before\", \"medium\", \"Holding a job may have some challenges that could potentially affect his mental health or motivation, though this is mitigated by his GED and current college enrollment which are positive factors in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\" drug use (marijuana) past four years \", \"low\", \"Drug use alone does not necessarily indicate a high risk of relapse, especially if he has previously been through significant life changes such as getting his GED and attending college which can help with mental health as seen in other cases where similar factors were present.\"),\n    (\" felt so down during past month - some time spent alone\", \"high\", \"Expressing feelings of emptiness or low mood can be a sign of underlying mental health issues which may affect his ability to function positively, and this was noted in examples where similar sentiments correlated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\" living with biological mother household size 3 urban area\", \"low\", \"Living with parents, even if in an urban setting, did not present a high risk of recidivism as seen in other cases where similar living arrangements were present but no significant issues arose. \"),\n    (\" considers God has nothing to do\", \"low\", \"No indication that religious influence is a negative factor which was not a concern in the examples provided where individuals with similar statements did not experience higher rates of recidivism. \"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
