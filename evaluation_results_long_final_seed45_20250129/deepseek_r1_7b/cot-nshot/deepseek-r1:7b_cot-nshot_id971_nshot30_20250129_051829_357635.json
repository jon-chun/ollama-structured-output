    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this 21-year-old male's risk factors for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a prior arrest and conviction. That\u2019s definitely a high risk because past criminal behavior increases the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Having a GED can sometimes help with job opportunities, but being enrolled in college suggests he's committed to improving himself, which might lower the risk\u2014so perhaps medium.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly indicate anything, so no immediate impact on risk here. He\u2019s never been married, so that factor isn\u2019t relevant.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years is a drug use issue. Drug use can impede employment and legal standing, making him a moderate risk.\n\nFeeling down for a month might point to emotional issues or substance abuse. This could affect his ability to function and commit new crimes\u2014moderate risk.\n\nAt 21 with prior convictions, he's still developing, so his age is an mitigating factor, lowering risk to low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a small urban household suggests he has a supportive family environment, which is good for overall well-being but maybe not directly related to recidivism\u2014so perhaps no direct impact or very low risk.\n\nBelieving in God could indicate personal motivation towards positive behavior, which might slightly lower risk\u2014but it's more of an internal factor. Since he feels down, it might counteract that belief a bit.\n\nPutting all together: Prior arrest is high, GED and college are medium, drug use moderate, emotional state moderate, age low, supportive family\u2014low or no impact. So overall risk would be moderately high but maybe leaning towards higher because of prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as past behavior is often indicative of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"While holding a GED and enrolled in college suggests some educational attainment, the ongoing education may indicate a commitment to positive change, mitigating but not entirely removing risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"moderate\", \"Use of marijuana can impact job opportunities and legal standing, increasing the chances of engaging in similar behavior which could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State/Feeling Down\", \"moderate\", \"Experiencing low mood for a month may indicate potential substance abuse or emotional distress, both factors that could contribute to substance use or unstable behavior leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"low\", \"At 21, the individual is still in their prime earning years and developing life skills, which can reduce the risk of criminal behavior compared to younger individuals with fewer life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement (Biological Mother in Household of Size 3)\", \"low\", \"Living with a supportive family environment generally provides stability and positive influences that can contribute to lower risk behaviors and better outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Having a belief in God may provide spiritual guidance and motivation towards positive behavior, which could help reduce the risk of substance abuse or unstable emotions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
