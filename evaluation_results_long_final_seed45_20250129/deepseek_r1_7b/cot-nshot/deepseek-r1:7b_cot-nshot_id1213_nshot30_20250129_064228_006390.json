    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the person is a 19-year-old Black female who hasn't been convicted for her arrest but has one conviction on her record. She's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs, living alone with her high school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. She's worked one job recently and hasn't felt depressed or down in the past month. Her young age means she might be more vulnerable, and she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. She believes in God, so that's a positive factor.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor for this case. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: 19 years old. Young adults might have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing skills and relationships. So maybe low risk here.\n\nNext, prior convictions: She has one but hasn't been convicted yet. Prior non-conviction is a positive indicator of lower risk compared to multiple or recent convictions.\n\nWeight: Medium? Because having any prior arrest could be a minor issue, especially if it's not on her record now. So medium weight.\n\nRace: Black. From the examples, Black individuals might have slightly higher recidivism rates than White, but since she hasn't been convicted yet and is younger, maybe this factor isn't as significant here. Maybe low weight because the data doesn't show a strong association when other factors are considered.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of five: Urban households can be more stressful sometimes, but having a stable living situation from her biological parents might indicate she has support and care. This could lower her risk. So maybe medium or low weight here.\n\nNo drugs used in the past four years: That's a positive sign. Not using substances can correlate with better job prospects and lower recidivism. High weight for this factor.\n\nNo feelings of depression over the past month: Being mentally stable is linked to better life choices and less likely to engage in risky behavior. High weight here too.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college: Education typically reduces recidivism rates because it's associated with higher earnings, better job opportunities, and more stable lives. High weight for education and enrollment.\n\nLiving alone but at 19, maybe she has some support from family or friends, especially if she's in a two-year college. That could mitigate living situation risks to medium or low weight.\n\nBelieves in God: Positive factor as spirituality can provide guidance and reduce stress. Low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are positive with only a couple of minor ones like prior arrest and household size. So the overall prediction would lean towards no rearrest but I'm not 100% confident because prior non-conviction might still have some impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate lower recidivism risk due to skill development and relationship building.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior arrest but no convictions, suggesting she may avoid more serious criminal behavior compared to those with multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates, this individual's lack of prior conviction and other positive factors reduce the impact of being Black in this context.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of five may provide stability but doesn't guarantee lower risk compared to larger households commonly seen in urban areas.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates good health and reduced access to substances that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"No depression felt over the past month suggests stable mental state, which is protective of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrollment in college are strong indicators of future stability and lower likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 19 may present challenges but doesn't necessarily correlate with higher recidivism rates compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is a positive factor that can contribute to better decision-making and reduced stress, further reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
