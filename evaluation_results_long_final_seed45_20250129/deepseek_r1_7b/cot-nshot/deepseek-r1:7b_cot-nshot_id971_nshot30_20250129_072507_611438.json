    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 21-year-old man will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through all the information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which means he's pretty young. The fact that he's been convicted once might have some weight on his recidivism risk. But since it's only one offense, maybe it's a medium factor.\n\nHe's White, but I don't know if race plays a big role here without more context. He's currently living alone, which could be a medium factor because living with family can provide support and reduce stress.\n\nHis education level is a GED and he's in college. That might actually lower his risk since higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and less likelihood of reoffending. So maybe low risk from this factor.\n\nHe's never been married, which is neutral but not directly related to recidivism unless there are other factors like substance use or family issues.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs, which isn't particularly high or low; it's more about his height and health, which might be a medium risk if he has underlying health issues that could lead to substance abuse problems.\n\nHe uses marijuana occasionally. Drug use can definitely increase the chance of reoffending, especially since it's an illegal drug in many places. That would probably be a high risk factor because drug use is strongly associated with criminal behavior.\n\nHe felt down during the past month and said nothing could cheer him up. This might indicate some level of mental distress or substance abuse, which are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk. So this is another high factor.\n\nAt 21, he's still developing, so maybe not much criminal history yet. But having a prior conviction does suggest some instability or issues that could lead to more problems later on.\n\nHe's living with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher rates of crime and stress, which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues that could lead to recidivism. So maybe medium risk from this factor.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal issues is interesting because if he's religious but doesn't see how it helps him, he might struggle with self-motivation for getting clean or seeking help, increasing his risk.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior conviction (medium), living alone (low to medium), GED and college (low), drug use (high), mental distress (high). So overall, the high factors are more significant. His prior offense is just one, but combined with other issues like substance abuse and emotional struggles, it's likely he could be at higher risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, which suggests some criminal history that may contribute to future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can provide some level of independence but may lack the support system that could prevent substance abuse or other issues.\"),\n    (\"GED and College\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and currently enrolled in college indicates a commitment to education, which is often associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Regular drug use, particularly marijuana, is strongly linked to increased criminal behavior and substance abuse issues, both of which are indicators of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for an extended period without relief suggests potential mental health issues or substance abuse, both of which can lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Urban Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area may expose the individual to higher crime rates and stressors that could contribute to substance abuse or other problematic behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not directly impact recidivism risk unless it affects personal motivation for seeking help, which is a contributing factor here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
