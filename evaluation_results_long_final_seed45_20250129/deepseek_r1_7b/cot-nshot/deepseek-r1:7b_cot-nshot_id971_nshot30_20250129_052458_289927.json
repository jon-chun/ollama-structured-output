    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine the relative weights of each risk factor for this case and then predict whether a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome will occur. Let's go through the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So this would be high weight.\n\nNext, he's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, but since there's no mention of health problems, I'll consider this as low.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living situation can affect mental health and support systems, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nHe holds a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Completing GED is beneficial for employment and education, which could positively influence his chances of rearrest. So low risk factor since he's actively trying to improve himself.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having some work experience can help with financial stability and skills transfer, so this might be a medium weight because it's positive but not the strongest indicator.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a concern as substance abuse often correlates with recidivism. So high weight here.\n\nHe feels down during the month; some mood issues can lead to self-harm or further issues, so this is medium weight because it's temporary but could be a contributing factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Shared environment and living with parents might offer support, so maybe low risk here unless there are family issues.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal happenstance; this indicates he may have a more deterministic view which can affect his motivation but isn't directly a risk factor for rearrest.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), GED and college (low), job experience (medium), drug use (high), mood issues (medium), living situation (low), and belief in lack of divine involvement (low). \n\nI think the higher factors like prior conviction and drug use will heavily influence a YES prediction. However, since he's getting education and is employed, it might balance out to a low confidence but leaning towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.
