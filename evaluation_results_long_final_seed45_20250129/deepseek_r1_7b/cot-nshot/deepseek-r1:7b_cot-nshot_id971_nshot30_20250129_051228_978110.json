    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the case is about a 21-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested once and convicted. His weight is 140 lbs, which seems okay but not sure if relevant. He's never married and living alone. He has a GED and is in college, which might mean he's motivated to get ahead. He worked one job during the year. He used marijuana in the past four years. Recently, he felt really down for a month.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, I need to compare this case with them to see how each factor influences rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: He has 1 arrest and it's convicted. In Example 26, someone with similar factors (arrest, GED, college) had a NO outcome but was young. Here, he\u2019s older at 21. Maybe past convictions increase the risk of rearrest.\n\n2. **Education/GED**: He has a GED and is in college. Examples like 24 show that having a GED or higher might reduce recidivism because people are more likely to seek employment or better education. His current enrollment could be positive, but Example 17 had someone with GED and no rearrest (YES), so this factor is probably low here.\n\n3. **Employment**: He held one job last year. Having some employment history can help, as seen in Examples 8 and 24 where YES outcomes occurred when employed. But he's currently not working full-time or maybe looking for another job? It\u2019s unclear if it affects rearrest much.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana but no hard drugs. Past drug use has a mixed effect; some examples (like Example 15) had NO, others (Example 20) had YES. Since he's in college and maybe seeking better opportunities, perhaps this is a mitigating factor, making the risk lower.\n\n5. **Living Alone**: He lives alone with no support network. Being an only child or living alone often increases recidivism because there's less emotional support to cope with stress or setbacks.\n\n6. **Household Size at Age of 18**: At age 18, he lived with both parents in a household of 5. Younger examples sometimes have higher risk initially but might stabilize later. Being an only child now could change things, though.\n\n7. **\u795e\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0**: He says God has nothing to do with his life. This can be a significant factor because religious support can provide coping mechanisms for stress or negative feelings. If he's more likely to experience low mood without that support, it might increase the risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Low on education and employment; Medium on no prior rearrest; High on living alone and lack of religious support. The arrest conviction is a moderate factor since being older but with a past offense should have some impact.\n\nSo overall, the risk seems higher because he's in a tough spot emotionally and socially, despite some positive factors like GED and college.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"medium\", \"He has one prior arrest and conviction, which can increase rearrest risk as seen in similar cases.\"),\n    (\"Education/GED\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and attending college may mitigate rearrest risk, but it's not the primary factor here.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding a job during the year shows some stability, which can help predict lower rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana is a mitigating factor as it might indicate potential for change or lack of substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases stress and isolation, leading to higher recidivism risk as seen in similar cases.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"low\", \"Living with parents at age 18 is a minor factor compared to current living situation.\"),\n    (\"\u795e\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\", \"high\", \"No religious support can be a significant factor, potentially leading to emotional distress and increased recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
