    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female based on her risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has one prior arrest but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a low risk compared to someone with multiple arrests or a conviction because she still has a chance to turn things around.\n\nShe's in a 2-year college and is actively holding a job. Education and employment usually help reduce recidivism, so this factor should be medium.\n\nLiving alone isn't a strong red flag here; it doesn't directly contribute to criminal behavior but also doesn't offer much support that could prevent issues. So, maybe low risk for that.\n\nShe's never been married, which again isn't an indicator of crime but might mean she has fewer family supports. Still, probably low impact on recidivism.\n\nHer drug use history is clean\u2014no drugs in the past four years, so no immediate risk factors related to substance abuse. She hasn't felt depressed either, which could indicate better mental health and coping strategies.\n\nShe's currently in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban living might mean more stressors or less stability, but since she's living with family, the impact is probably low. God involvement is considered positive here, so that's another mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest (low), education and job (medium), living alone (low), never married (low), clean drug history (low), no depression (low). Most factors are either low or medium with only the prior arrest. Since she has no active risk factors, her recidivism is likely to be low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"She has one prior arrest but hasn't been convicted yet, which reduces recidivism risk compared to individuals with multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"She is in a 2-year college and holds a job, which are positive factors that can contribute to better outcomes and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't directly indicate a high risk of recidivism but also doesn't offer much support that could prevent issues.
