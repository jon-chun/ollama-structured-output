    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant risk factor\u2014high weight because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. While having a GED can sometimes help, being in college suggests he might be motivated to improve, but I'm not sure if that's enough for a high weight\u2014it might be medium.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly indicate risk, so low weight. His job experience\u2014held one during the year\u2014might show some stability, maybe contributing a bit, but not a high weight factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is concerning and increases risk, so high weight.\n\nFeeling down for a month could be linked to mental health issues or substance abuse, which ties back to drug use and possibly higher recidivism\u2014so medium to high weight.\n\nAt 21 with lived in biological mother's household of three might indicate some instability but not extreme risk. Considering God has no influence adds another layer suggesting he may not seek help, increasing risk\u2014high weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), GED and college enrollment (medium), living alone (low), job experience (low), drug use (high), recent mood (medium), family background (high). High weight because of multiple high factors like prior arrest, drug use, and possible lack of support from God.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 21-year-old male:\n\n- Prior Arrest/Conviction: High\n- GED and College Enrollment: Medium\n- Living Alone: Low\n- Job Experience: Low\n- Drug Use (Marijuana): High\n- Recent Mood: Medium\n- Family Background: High\n\nThe high weight is due to the presence of multiple significant risk factors like prior conviction, drug use, and potential lack of support from God. These factors strongly indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"High because of a prior conviction which is a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Medium as GED can sometimes aid but college enrollment alone doesn't guarantee stability or lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Low due to no direct association with high recidivism risk despite living situation not indicating immediate stressors.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Low because holding a job during the year shows some level of responsibility and past stability in work, which might suggest better outcomes but not necessarily lower risk directly.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"High as drug use is strongly associated with increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Recent Mood\", \"medium\", \"Medium because feeling down for a month could be linked to mental health issues or substance abuse which ties back to drug use and possibly higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"High due to living in a household of size 3 with biological mother, indicating potential instability and lack of support from God which can contribute to higher risk behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
