    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. I need to analyze each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is within a typical age range for predicting rearrest. Next, he has one arrest and one conviction. That seems significant because prior convictions are usually indicators of recidivism.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs at 5'7\". Not sure how that directly affects, but maybe related to health issues or substance use. He's living alone, which might contribute to feelings of isolation, leading him to possibly engage in self-harming behaviors or feel low mood.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. A GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, so that might lower the risk. However, being in college could also indicate he's proactive about his future, which is positive but depends on how he uses it.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year; having some income stability might help with substance use or financial issues.\n\nDrugs are a problem\u2014marijuana use can affect mental health and self-control. That's definitely a risk factor.\n\nHis mood has been down recently, which could be due to various stressors but also maybe drug use. Living with his biological mother in a household of 3 is small, so maybe he feels isolated or neglected.\n\nConsidering God as unrelated\u2014maybe he's searching for meaning elsewhere, but if that's the case, it might not directly contribute to recidivism unless there are other issues like lack of support system.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a prior conviction, which raises red flags. His drug use is present, and mood issues could stem from various factors including substance abuse or family environment. The GED and college enrollment are positives but might not offset the other negative factors.\n\nSo his risk seems medium to high. But looking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases with a prior conviction and drug use often resulted in YES for rearrest. So my prediction is that he will have a recidivism outcome of YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and one conviction, which are significant risk factors indicating past behavior that could lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"high\", \"The presence of marijuana use in the past four years is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mood issues\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for an extended period may indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors that could lead to further behavioral problems.\"),\n    (\"living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone in a household of 3 suggests possible isolation but doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without other contributing factors like substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"education and College enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college indicates some level of self-direction, but may not fully offset other negative factors like drug use and prior convictions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
