    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. The person is a 19-year-old female Black individual with several risk factors. First, she has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests prior encounters with the legal system\u2014though no conviction means maybe less immediate recidivism risk compared to someone who has been convicted.\n\nHer weight and height aren't directly related to recidivism, so I can note that as low relevance. Her lack of a high school diploma is interesting; she's got a GED but isn't enrolled in college now. That might be a medium factor because having a GED could sometimes correlate with better job opportunities or higher earnings, which are associated with lower recidivism.\n\nShe's living alone, which usually doesn't directly relate to rearrest rates compared to other factors. Her age is 19, which is relatively young, and she's in her second year of college\u2014so she might be on a path towards better opportunities, maybe a medium factor here.\n\nShe has only held one job, which isn't bad, but considering she's young and has some legal issues, that could slightly increase the risk. Her lack of drug use is positive, so that's low as it reduces the chance of substance abuse contributing to recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married, which might be a non-issue in terms of recidivism. She's lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area\u2014size and living arrangement could influence, but since she's Black, that might have some negative connotations regarding systemic issues affecting her chances.\n\nHer belief in God is positive for her mental health, so that's low risk. \n\nPutting it all together, the factors don't strongly indicate high recidivism but there are some moderate concerns like legal history and living situation. Her age could be a mitigating factor, and her education level might offer opportunities to improve her situation. So I think she has a lower chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted can indicate potential for recidivism risk, though no prior convictions may reduce immediate risk compared to those who have been convicted.
