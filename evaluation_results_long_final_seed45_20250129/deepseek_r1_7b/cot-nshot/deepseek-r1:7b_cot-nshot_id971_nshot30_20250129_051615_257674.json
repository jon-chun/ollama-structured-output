    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this case to analyze. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has some arrest history\u2014been arrested once but not convicted. He's currently living alone at 5 feet 7 inches and 140 lbs. He has a GED and is enrolled in college, which seems pretty good. He's never married, so no family support there. He's been working one job during the year.\n\nHis drug use is only marijuana from the past four years, but he felt down recently. That's concerning because it shows ongoing struggles. Living alone with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014maybe that environment could be affecting him now. He doesn't believe in God, which might influence his coping mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each risk factor is assigned low, medium, or high weight based on how significant it is to recidivism. Let me break down each factor for this case:\n\n1. **Arrests**: He has one arrest but no conviction. That's a red flag becauseConvictions are more impactful than arrests alone. So maybe this factor would have a medium weight.\n\n2. **GED and College**: Having a GED is positive, but being enrolled in college is strong. Both suggest he's committed to further education, which usually reduces recidivism. Maybe high weight here since both credentials are present.\n\n3. **Marital Status**: Never married means no family support network. This could be a medium risk factor because lack of support can lead to isolation and increased stress.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: He uses marijuana but only once a year, and he's felt down recently. That suggests ongoing substance use issues, which is high risk as it can affect mental health and self-esteem.\n\n5. **Living Alone**: Living alone with his ex-parents in an urban area\u2014maybe he's dealing with some stress or isolation here. Urban environments can be isolating if not socialized enough, so medium weight.\n\n6. **Household Size**: Small household of three might indicate a tighter family environment initially but now living alone could mean he needs support more than before.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: Not believing in God might affect his coping mechanisms and emotional well-being. If feeling down is related to that, it's high risk because lack of religious support can lead to personal issues affecting recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest isn't as impactful without a conviction, but the GED and college are positive factors. The main concerns are drug use (high), living alone with no family support (medium), recent feelings of low mood (high), lack of marriage (medium), and disbelief in God (high). \n\nThe high risk factors seem to outweigh the positive ones, so I'm leaning towards a NO prediction but with some uncertainty because of his education background. The confidence is around 50% since the positives are there but the negatives are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest without a conviction indicates potential past behavior, which can influence future actions.\"),\n    (\"GED and College\", \"high\", \"Both credentials suggest commitment to education, which is typically associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never being married may provide some support network, but it also increases isolation risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood suggest ongoing substance issues that can affect mental health and stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after living with parents could lead to isolation or stress, depending on the environment and support networks.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 3 may have provided some initial support but lacks the same level of closeness now that he's living alone.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious belief might affect coping mechanisms, potentially leading to increased stress or mood issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
