    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got to predict whether this 21-year-old male will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each of his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That alone might not be too bad because if he's served the sentence, maybe he'll have a better chance. But since it's just an arrest, that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes help with getting better jobs or housing, so that's a positive sign. Being in college is also good because it shows commitment to improving himself, which could lower recidivism. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone doesn't immediately seem like a big red flag unless there are other negatives, but he's never married and his living situation here seems stable. So that might be low risk.\n\nHe has a job history of one hold-up in the past year. If it was resolved without issues, maybe it's a medium risk because if he had more active criminal behavior, like multiple offenses or serious crimes, that could increase risk. But just one arrest might not be too bad.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014he used marijuana. That's a bit concerning but probably not life-threatening unless it's frequent or severe. Since it's just once, maybe it's medium risk.\n\nFeeling down and demotivated during the past month. This is a red flag because chronic stress can lead to self-harming behaviors or increased substance use. It might also correlate with more serious issues he's facing, which could make him more likely to reoffend. So this is probably high risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of three\u2014family support is usually good, but if there are other family issues or the environment isn't ideal, it could be medium. But since he's living with them and it's an urban area, maybe it's not too bad.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with him\u2014religion can influence behavior; if he doesn't see a higher power as influential, might align with more secular values or external pressures, which could lower risk, but it's also subjective. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting all this together: Medium to high risk due to the feeling down and drug use. The arrest history is light, so maybe not the biggest issue. But the combination of demotivation and possible family environment makes me lean towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has one prior arrest\", \"low\", \"Medium risk: One prior arrest without conviction might indicate active criminal behavior but no severe offense.
