    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this case to analyze. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old male, White, with one arrest and one conviction. His weight is 140 lbs at 5'7\", which doesn't immediately raise red flags but also isn't a significant concern. He's single and living alone, which might suggest some independence issues or potential social challenges.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in a 4-year college, which could mean he's motivated to improve his education and future prospects. He's employed one job during the year, indicating some work experience but not necessarily stability.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years. That's within the defined risk window and might contribute to recidivism if not addressed. His current feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors that aren't being fully explored here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three, which is relatively stable but not without challenges. The area being urban might have different social dynamics compared to smaller towns.\n\nImportantly, he says God has no influence on his life, suggesting a potential lack of religious support and possible coping mechanisms for stress or emotional issues.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided, I need to see how each risk factor correlates with rearrest. For instance, being Black in some cases led to higher recidivism rates, but this person is White. Having a GED instead of a diploma might offer more opportunities, as seen in some positive outcomes.\n\nThe presence of a drug use history (marijuana) was linked to higher recidivism in several cases. Feeling down for a month could point towards underlying issues like depression or anxiety, which aren't always captured by simple mood indicators. \n\nLiving with his mother might offer support, but household size affects stability\u2014three people could be manageable but might also present challenges if there's conflict or strain.\n\nConsidering all these points, I need to weigh each factor. The GED and college enrollment are positive signs (high), while the drug use is a moderate risk (medium). The mood issues and living situation with his mother could add some medium factors, but overall, the education level might outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"The individual has one arrest and one conviction, which is within a manageable range and does not immediately suggest recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Previous marijuana use in the past four years could indicate potential substance abuse issues that may correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood State\", \"low\", \"While feeling down for a month is concerning, it's possible this is a temporary state and not indicative of long-term mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"holding a GED indicates some educational attainment and potential life skills that may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Employed one job during the year suggests some financial stability, which is a positive indicator for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with a biological mother in a household of three indicates moderate support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"low\", \"No religious influence mentioned could suggest reliance on other stress-relief mechanisms or potential coping strategies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
