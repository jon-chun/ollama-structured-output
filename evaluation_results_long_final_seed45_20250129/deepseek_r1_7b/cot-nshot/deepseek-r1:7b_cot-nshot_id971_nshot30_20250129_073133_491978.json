    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the provided examples.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which isn't a major issue, but he's just entering adulthood. Not sure how that factors in yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with similar arrest counts had mixed outcomes, so maybe this alone isn't too significant.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs at 5'7\". The examples don't specify height, but his BMI might be a factor if it's considered overweight, which could increase risk. Not sure yet.\n\nHe never married and lives alone. Living alone is common among recidivists, so maybe this isn't a strong indicator either way.\n\nHaving a GED certificate and enrolled in college shows he's committed to further education, which usually helps reduce recidivism. So that might be a mitigating factor.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Employment, especially with a GED, often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014he used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse can increase recidivism risk because of potential relapse and related issues.\n\nFeeling down or depressed for some time is noted. Depression can be a precursor to substance abuse and may also lead to more risky behavior, which could contribute to recidivism.\n\nAt 21, he's at an age where he might still have positive life choices ahead. However, his past issues suggest otherwise.\n\nHe lives with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates or unstable environments, which could affect recidivism.\n\nConsidering God has no role, which is different from the examples where some factors relate to religious or supportive environments, so maybe this is positive as it suggests he's self-sufficient.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrest and now being convicted. His education level is good, but he's in college, which might help. Employment is present, which is positive. Drug use and depression are areas to watch. Living with his mother in an urban area could be a risk factor if the environment isn't supportive.\n\nIn the examples provided, people with multiple negative factors (arrests, drug use, living alone) had higher rearrest rates. This person has some mitigating factors like education and employment but also some concerning aspects. So I'm leaning towards a NO prediction because of the arrest history, living situation, and potential for substance abuse issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant factor in recidivism as seen in similar cases where prior convictions lead to higher rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"He is enrolled in college and has held one job during the year.
