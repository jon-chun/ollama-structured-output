    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White, has one arrest and conviction, weighs 140 lbs, never married, living alone with his GED, enrolled in college, held a job, used marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived with his mom in a household of three urban area, and believes God isn't influencing his life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. First, the number of arrests and convictions is medium weight because one offense might have some impact but isn't severe enough to guarantee recidivism.\n\nHis education level is a GED, which in the examples seems to correlate with lower recidivism since many with high school diplomas don't reoffend as often. So that's low risk.\n\nLiving alone can be medium because while it's a risk factor, it's mitigated by his stable environment from his mom and attending college.\n\nThe GED is already considered, so maybe not adding more weight there. College enrollment might actually lower recidivism because education can lead to better job opportunities, but in the examples, some college students didn't reoffend much, so perhaps medium.\n\nHolding a job is positive as it can provide stability and reduce temptation to turn to illegal activities. So that's low risk.\n\nDrug use here is only marijuana, which isn't as severe as harder drugs, so maybe lower weight than other drug users in examples.\n\nFeeling down or depressed for some time might indicate underlying issues but not directly tied to recidivism unless it's a sign of more serious issues like substance abuse. Maybe medium because other factors could influence this.\n\nLiving with his biological mother suggests he has a supportive family, which is usually protective against reoffending. So lower risk here.\n\nBelieving in God might be seen as a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting all together: Medium to high risk factors are the past arrest (medium), feeling down (medium), and drug use (low). The rest are mostly low or medium. Considering that he has a GED and is enrolled in college, which tend to lower recidivism, but his other factors like being White, living alone, etc., might add some risk.\n\nSo overall, the balance leans towards high risk because of the arrest, depression-like feelings, and maybe not as strong ties to support. So I'd predict a high chance he'll reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests and convictions\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight because one prior conviction can influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level (GED)\", \"low\", \"Low weight as having a GED is associated with lower recidivism in examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight due to potential isolation despite living with family and attending college.\"),\n    (\"College enrollment status\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight because college attendance can mitigate but isn't always certain to reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (1 job held during the year)\", \"low\", \"Low weight as employment is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (Marijuana only)\", \"low\", \"Low weight since marijuana use alone doesn't strongly indicate high recidivism risk compared to other drugs.\"),\n    (\"Emotional state (Felt down for some time)\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight as this could signal underlying issues but not directly tied to substance abuse yet.\"),\n    (\"Family background (Lived with biological mother in household of 3)\", \"low\", \"Low weight due to family support, which is protective against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief (God has no influence on life)\", \"low\", \"Low weight as religious beliefs can be protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
