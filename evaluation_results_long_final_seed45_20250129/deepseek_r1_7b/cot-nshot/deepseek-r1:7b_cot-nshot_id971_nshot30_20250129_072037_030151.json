    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this case based on the provided examples. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White, has one arrest and conviction, weighs 140 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED, enrolled in college, worked one job, uses marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area, and believes God doesn't influence his life.\n\nFirst, the arrest and conviction: once is moderate. GED is good for employment but maybe not directly related to recidivism. Enrolled in college shows commitment; might be low risk. Single job is stable. Weight is low\u2014140 lbs isn't heavy, so no health issue there.\n\nDrug use: marijuana can indicate substance abuse which may increase risk. Feeling down might relate to mental health issues, which can affect rearrest rates. Living with a single parent in urban area could mean more stress or environment issues.\n\nHe's 21, young age\u2014maybe less recidivism but also more experimentation. Considering God has no influence could indicate personal motivation for change, maybe better risk.\n\nPutting it all together: factors pushing him towards reoffending are moderate, while others like education and stable living are positive. Maybe a medium to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest and conviction which could indicate past behavior that might influence future decisions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years may not necessarily be a strong indicator of future substance use leading to recidivism, but it shows awareness of drug issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State - Felt Down Recently\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down recently could indicate potential mental health issues that might affect decision-making and reoffending rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment (GED and College Enrolled)\", \"high\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college shows commitment to further education which can positively influence employment stability and personal growth, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation - Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is stable and might reduce stressors associated with living with family, which could be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18 - Biological Mother, Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 3 with his biological mother may have had different influences compared to larger households.
