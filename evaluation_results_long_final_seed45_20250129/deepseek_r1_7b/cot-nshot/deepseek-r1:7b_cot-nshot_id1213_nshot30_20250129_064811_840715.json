    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this case. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 19 years old, which is relatively young but close to adulthood. Younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and experiences. So I'd give this a medium weight.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma. High school graduates tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to those without any formal education, so that's probably low risk. But she's also enrolled in a 2-year college, which might indicate she's proactive about her education. That could slightly reduce the risk factor here.\n\nLiving situation: She's living alone with her biological mother in an urban area. Living with family can provide support and stability, which is good for reducing recidivism. So this would be low risk.\n\nEmployment: She has held 1 job during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows she can manage tasks on her own. This might slightly lower the risk factor, so maybe medium weight.\n\nNo drug use: She hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism because of potential substance abuse issues or related problems. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nMental health: She's not felt depressed over the past month. Being mentally stable is a positive indicator, so this would have a low weight.\n\nPast living arrangements: At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5. Family support can help prevent issues like substance abuse or unstable environments, so that's low risk.\n\nReligious belief: She believes in God and sees it as affecting her personal life positively. This could offer emotional support and stability, which is good for reducing recidivism. So this factor would have a medium weight because it's positive but not directly related to the factors we're assessing here.\n\nArrest history: She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Having an arrest record can sometimes be mitigated if she's actively working on her issues, so this might slightly lower the risk. However, since she isn't convicted, maybe it's a low or medium weight depending on other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors are positive and supportive, which usually predict lower recidivism. The only negative is past arrest, but without a conviction, it's less impactful. So I think her risk of rearrest in 3 years is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 19 years old may increase the risk slightly due to her age being relatively young.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma, which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area provides stability and support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held 1 job during the year suggests some level of responsibility but may not be directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years indicates a stable and responsible lifestyle, which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month suggests good mental health, which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Past Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with her mother at age 19 in a household of five may have been stabilizing and positive for her younger years.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God may offer emotional support but does not directly correlate with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"Being arrested once without a conviction could be mitigated by active efforts to resolve issues, making it less impactful.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
