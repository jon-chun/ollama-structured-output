    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So that should be a high weight.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can increase the risk of substance abuse and other unstable environments, so another high weight here.\n\nHis GED certificate is interesting. While having a GED can sometimes help in getting better jobs or education, it also might indicate lower support systems. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism directly. Maybe medium weight.\n\nHe's enrolled in a 4-year college and has held one job during the year. Being in higher education could offer more stability, so maybe a slight negative effect on recidivism, but his employment history is positive, so perhaps medium to low weight.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana) is another risk factor. Drug use can impair judgment and lead to other problems, so high weight here.\n\nHe felt down during the past month; that's a measure of current mental health issues. This could affect his ability to function and recidivate, so high weight.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household size 3 suggests he has a stable family background since he was young, which is actually protective against recidivism, maybe low weight.\n\nHe considers God as having no influence on his life, which might lead him to more self-centered behavior and less support network, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (high), living alone (high), GED (medium), college enrollment (maybe medium), drug use (high), current mental health issues (high), stable family (low), lack of God influence (high). \n\nI think the overall risk is quite high because several key factors like prior arrest, drug use, and lack of support are pushing towards recidivism. So my prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence level around 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"High risk due to prior conviction which is a significant indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress, substance abuse risks and other unstable environments\"),\n    (\"ged_certificate\", \"medium\", \"While GED can sometimes aid in job prospects, it may lack the support systems that can reduce risk\"),\n    (\"college_enrollment\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in a 4-year college could offer stability but no direct impact on recidivism based on provided data\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Drug use is strongly associated with increased recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"current_mental_health_issues\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for a month can affect ability to function and contribute positively to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background_size\", \"low\", \"Household size 3 suggests a relatively stable family environment which may offer support\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"high\", \"Lack of God influence might lead to self-centered behavior with fewer social supports\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
