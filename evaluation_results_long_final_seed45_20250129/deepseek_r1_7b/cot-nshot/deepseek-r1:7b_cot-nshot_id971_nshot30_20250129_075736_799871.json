    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this person. Let me go through each of his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a 21-year-old White male with a conviction history\u2014just one arrest but it was convictions, so that's a moderate risk. He's currently living alone, which can be a red flag because living alone increases the chances of experiencing stress or loneliness, especially if someone he cares about is nearby.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which are positive steps towards better opportunities. But his job history\u2014only one job during the year\u2014isn't great either; it shows some inconsistency in income stability.\n\nDrug use past four years\u2014he used marijuana, so that's concerning because substance abuse can lead to mental health issues and increased recidivism rates.\n\nHe felt down for a month, which might indicate depression or stress. That's another negative factor because it could lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nYoung age at living with his biological mother in a household of three\u2014though he's 21 now, that history can affect him emotionally and socially as an adult.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which might mean he's dealing with personal issues that aren't addressed by religion, possibly leading to more self-reliance but also potential emotional vulnerabilities.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history, living alone, substance abuse, feelings of low mood, and an unstable living situation. These factors weigh towards a higher risk. I'm leaning towards predicting \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"A conviction history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which indicates some involvement in the legal system and could be a predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is often associated with increased stress, loneliness, and higher risk of negative mental health outcomes, which can contribute to substance abuse and decreased job stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a significant risk factor for substance abuse, which can lead to unstable mental health and increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood feeling down during the past month\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing a prolonged period of low mood can indicate underlying mental health issues that may escalate into more severe behaviors or self-harm attempts, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Small household living arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living with just one parent in a small household can contribute to emotional and psychological challenges as an adult, potentially leading to increased stress and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Non-religious belief\", \"medium\", \"Non-belief in God may reflect on personal mental health and coping mechanisms, which could influence self-reliance but also potential emotional vulnerabilities.\"),\n    (\"EDUCATION: GED and enrolled in college\": \"low\"|\"medium\"),  -- Assuming GED is considered as completed education\n    (\"EMPLOYMENT: Employed one job per year\": \"low\", \"stable employment history may indicate better financial stability and reduced stress, which could lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
