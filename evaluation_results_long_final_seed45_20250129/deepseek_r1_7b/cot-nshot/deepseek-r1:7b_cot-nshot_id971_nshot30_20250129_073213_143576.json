    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old male who's White. He has a few risk factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once but didn't get convicted. That might not be too bad since it's a warning, but if he's not convicted again in the next three years, that could help lower his chances. So maybe this is low or medium weight.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs and is 5'7\". Since he's 21, he's an adult, so maybe physical weight isn't a big issue here. Probably low risk factor.\n\nNever married living alone. That's good because being married can sometimes provide support. So this should be low or medium, but I think it's more about the environment than his personal status. Maybe medium since living alone doesn't directly correlate with crime rates unless there are other factors like unstable situations.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college. Education usually helps reduce recidivism. High weight because having a GED gives him better job opportunities, so this factor should positively influence the prediction towards no rearrest.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Having stable employment can reduce stress and financial strain, which might lower the risk of feeling down or needing to turn to criminal activities. So maybe medium weight here.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to substance abuse, and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism. High weight for this factor.\n\nFeeling down or depressed some of the time. Emotional instability can lead to impulsive decisions or self-harm, both of which are indicators of potential recidivism. This is a high-weight risk factor because it directly relates to mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and stress levels, but since he's living with family, that support should help. Maybe medium weight here as the environment is urban but he has family support.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life. If someone doesn't believe in a higher power, they might engage in self-doubt or risky behaviors influenced by their lack of faith. This could be a medium to high weight factor depending on how strongly it affects their motivation towards positive actions.\n\nPutting it all together: Conviction status is a mitigating factor (low), living alone with support from family (medium), education and college (high), job (medium), drug use (high), depression (high), urban environment but family living situation (medium), and lack of divine involvement (medium). The high factors like drug use, depression, and lack of religious support are likely to push the prediction towards a YES for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"low\", \"His only arrest was not a conviction, which is mitigating compared to future possible convictions.\"),\n    (\"family living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no spouse despite being adult may have some risk factors but family support is maintained through biological mother's household of 3 in urban area which might provide stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Having a GED and enrolled in college can positively influence his job opportunities and stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year, which provides some economic stability but may not directly correlate with long-term behavior changes\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past\", \"high\", \"Drug use history (marijuana) is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to risky behaviors that may result in recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_state\", \"high\", \"Feeling down or depressed some of the time indicates potential for emotional instability which can drive impulsive decisions leading to recidivism\"),\n    (\"residence_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a family's support despite being in a household size 3 suggests that while environment may contribute indirectly, the family presence mitigates some risk factors\"),\n    (\"religion_influence\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has no role in his life can affect self-esteem and motivation towards positive actions but is not as directly linked to recidivism as other factors like drug use or mental health\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
