    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to assign weights to each risk factor for the given person and then predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor\u2014convictions are strongly linked to recidivism. So, high weight here.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't typically a major factor unless it's related to substance use or health issues, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014being single can sometimes reduce immediate needs for substance abuse support, but it also might mean less support network, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in college. GEDs are considered equivalent to high school diplomas, which can positively influence his job prospects and self-esteem, reducing recidivism risk\u2014so lower weight here.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year\u2014he was employed, which usually helps with financial stability and reduces stress, so lower weight.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself is a risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's recent or frequent\u2014medium weight given the history but not severe.\n\nFelt down during the month\u2014he felt emotionally low. Emotional distress can be tied to substance abuse or other mental health issues, which are risk factors\u2014so medium weight.\n\nYoung age at arrest (21), but with a GED and being enrolled in college, so he's proactive about his education and job\u2014somewhat mitigating risk, maybe lower weight.\n\nLiving with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban living can provide various social supports, which might reduce recidivism\u2014so lower weight.\n\nBelieves God has no role\u2014it suggests he may not rely on religion for coping or support, which could increase stress and substance use\u2014a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are the prior conviction and current employment. Medium factors include drug use, emotional distress, and lack of religious support. Lower factors like being single and educated with active college enrollment might somewhat reduce risk but aren't as significant.\n\nSo, overall, considering the high weight on prior convictions and medium on other factors, I'm leaning towards a higher recidivism probability.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- High risk: Prior conviction (high)\n- Medium risks: Drug use, emotional distress, lack of religious support\n- Lower risks: Education, employment, living arrangement\n\nPrediction: The individual has a higher likelihood of rearrest due to prior convictions and current factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"Convictions are strongly associated with recidivism as they indicate past criminal behavior which can lead to similar behavior again.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impede employment and daily functioning.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"medium\", \"Frequent emotional distress may signal underlying issues that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Religious Support\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has no role in personal matters can increase stress, leading to substance use or other negative coping mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having a job and being enrolled in college indicates proactive steps toward self-improvement which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide fewer social supports compared to living with family, which could influence stress levels and substance use patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
