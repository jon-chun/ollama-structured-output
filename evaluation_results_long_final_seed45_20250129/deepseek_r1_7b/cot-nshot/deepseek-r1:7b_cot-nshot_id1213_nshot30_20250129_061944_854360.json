    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the case step by step to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors based on her background:\n\n1. **Age**: She is 19 years old, which is relatively young and could influence her ability to reintegrate into society or commit crimes.\n2. **Arrests**: She has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. This might indicate prior legal issues that could affect future stability.\n3. **Weight and Height**: At 5'6\" and 190 lbs, she's within a typical range for her age, so no significant health indicators here.\n4. **Marital Status**: She is single and never married. Single status can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates due to lack of support network.\n5. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can positively influence job opportunities, which might reduce recidivism.\n6. **Employment**: She held one job during the year. Employment, especially in stable positions, is usually linked to lower recidivism rates as it provides financial stability and purpose.\n7. **Drug Use**: No drug use in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of sobriety and self-control.\n8. **Mental Health**: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Positive mental health can contribute to better decision-making and lower recidivism chances.\n9. **Household Size at Age**: She lived with her biological mother in a household of five, which is small but might not directly correlate with higher risk unless there are issues like neglect or abuse.\n10. **Support System**: She considers God as part of her support system. Religious involvement can sometimes offer guidance and reduce impulsive behaviors.\n\nNow, assigning weights to each factor:\n\n- **Marital Status (low)**: Being single might have some influence but not a strong one without more context on the nature of her living situation.\n- **Employment (medium)**: Having a job is positive, but only one in the past year might mean it's possible she's looking for better opportunities or hasn't been stable enough.\n- **Education Level (high)**: Higher education can mitigate recidivism by providing skills and reducing exposure to criminal environments.\n- **Household Size at Age (low)**: A small household doesn't inherently increase risk unless there are systemic issues, which isn't indicated here.\n- **Mental Health (high)**: Positive mental health is a strong positive factor that can reduce the likelihood of substance abuse or impulsive decisions.\n\nConsidering these factors, her education and employment track positively influence her recidivism risk. However, her single status, despite being low weight, might slightly increase concerns about support networks. The absence of drug use and positive mental health further mitigate any negative risks. \n\nGiven all this, she's in a favorable position with strong mitigating factors. Therefore, the prediction leans towards **NO** for rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19 years old, which may influence her ability to reintegrate into society or commit crimes.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but hasn't been convicted, which might indicate prior legal issues that could affect future stability.\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"She is at 5'6\" and 190 lbs, within a typical range for her age, so no significant health indicators here.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"She is single and never married.
