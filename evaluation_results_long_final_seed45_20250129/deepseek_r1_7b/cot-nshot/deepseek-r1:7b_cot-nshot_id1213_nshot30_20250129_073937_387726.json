    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through each of her risk factors step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is quite young but she's close to completing her sentence if convicted soon. The fact that she has been arrested once but not convicted might mean she could rearrest after finishing her sentence or facing new charges. Her height and weight are within a normal range (5'6\" and 190 lbs), so no issues there.\n\nShe is never married and living alone, which is a stable living situation. She has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. Being enrolled suggests she's still focused on further education or training after release, which could positively impact her reintegration into society.\n\nShe held one job during the year; having some work experience might help with financial stability and retraining skills if needed. No drug use history for four years is a strong positive indicator of substance abuse control, reducing potential triggers for relapse.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests she's mentally stable, which can prevent self-harm or other negative behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nShe lives with her biological mother in an urban household of five people. Urban settings might offer different opportunities and challenges compared to rural areas, but having a consistent family environment is generally protective against recidivism.\n\nHer belief in God could provide emotional support and help her stay on track with positive values, which can aid in avoiding criminal behavior after release.\n\nLooking at the examples given, most factors like low education level without ongoing training or multiple prior offenses tend to correlate with higher rearrest rates. However, this individual has a high school diploma and is actively pursuing further education, along with stable living conditions. The lack of recent drug use, no depression, and single-parent household also suggest lower risk.\n\nTherefore, weighing each factor: Education (high), Employment (medium?), Drug Use (low), Family Support (high). Considering all these, her chances seem lower than average but not impossible to rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"She is 19 years old, close to completing her sentence.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"She has one job and is enrolled in college, which may indicate proactive steps toward reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years indicates good control over substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married, living alone suggests a stable living situation.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in 2-year college shows commitment to further education.\"),\n    (\"Family Support\", \"high\", \"Lives with biological mother in an urban household of five, providing emotional support.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"No depression felt over the past month indicates good mental health.\"),\n    (\"Re-arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without conviction suggests a potential for reintegration.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
