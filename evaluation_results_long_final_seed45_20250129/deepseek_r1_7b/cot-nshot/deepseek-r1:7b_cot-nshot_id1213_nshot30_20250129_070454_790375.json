    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's never been married and is living alone. I remember in the examples that being single can sometimes be a lower risk factor, but it also depends on other factors like where she lives and her support network. In this case, she mentioned her household size was 5 when she was younger, which might indicate some level of stability, so maybe low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because people are more likely to get jobs or support if they have higher education. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. I think having an arrest record, even without a conviction, can be a red flag, but since she hasn't been convicted, it might be less severe than someone who has served time. But it's still something to consider\u2014maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's never had any drug use in the past four years. That\u2019s a strong negative indicator because substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior and higher chances of relapse or reoffending. So that's low.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which could mean she's mentally stable. Low risk there as well.\n\nHer living situation now: single, no children mentioned, so maybe some independence but not much support. But since she was raised with her biological mother and lived in a household of five when younger, that might provide some stability\u2014so maybe medium because while it's not the best, it's better than nothing.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life. That could indicate positive spiritual support, which is generally protective against recidivism\u2014it\u2019s a low risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: no significant issues that stand out as high-risk factors. Only one potential medium factor related to her living situation now, but the others are either low or neutral. So I\u2019d lean towards NO for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record (No Conviction)\", \"medium\", \"Her single arrest without conviction is a point of concern, indicating potential past issues that might affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a diploma and being enrolled in college typically correlates with better educational outcomes and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History (1 Job)\", \"low\", \"One job indicates stable income, which can aid in personal stability and reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (None in Past 4 Years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use history is a positive indicator of sobriety and lower risk of substance abuse-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (No Depression in Past Month)\", \"low\", \"Stable mental health contributes to better decision-making and lowers the risk of impulsive or harmful actions.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Single, No Children)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support can sometimes lead to isolation but may also provide a sense of independence which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Consideration (God's Influence)\", \"low\", \"Positive spiritual factors often correlate with better personal stability and lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
