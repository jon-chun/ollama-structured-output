    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which isn't too concerning yet. He's been arrested once and convicted\u2014so a prior conviction could be a red flag but not super high.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs, and he's 5'7\"\u2014a bit on the lighter side. Not sure how that affects it here, maybe just noting.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014that might indicate some social isolation or past instability.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college full-time. That\u2019s positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and outcomes.\n\nHeld one job recently\u2014some work experience is good but not ideal if it's low-paying or unstable.\n\nDrug use: only marijuana in the past four years. That might be concerning, as even recent drug use can affect recidivism risk.\n\nFeeling down for a month could indicate some mental health issues or stressors that might contribute to future issues.\n\nYoung age at living situation\u2014living with his biological mother in a household of 3. Maybe indicates a stable environment but also maybe past neglect if he's never married and has no kids yet.\n\nHe says God is not involved, so he might have different life support systems which could impact stability.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (medium), GED and college (high positive factors), job history (low), drug use (negative), feeling down (possible negative), living with mother in a small household (maybe medium, depending on other factors). His current environment is somewhat stable but has some negatives like prior arrest and drug use.\n\nSo overall, the risk seems moderately high. I might lean towards a NO prediction because of his education and being enrolled in college, which are strong positive indicators. But his prior arrest could also be a significant factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which is within the typical age range for entering the workforce and starting independent life.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"He has been arrested once and convicted, which can be a significant risk factor but may indicate past stability if followed by positive factors.\"),\n    (\"Weight and Height\", \"low\", \"His weight is 140 lbs, and he is 5'7\\\".
