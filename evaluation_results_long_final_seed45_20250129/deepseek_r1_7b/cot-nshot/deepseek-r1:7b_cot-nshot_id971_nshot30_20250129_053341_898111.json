    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 21-year-old male who is White. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his past convictions: he has one, so that's a medium risk because prior offense history can increase chances of recidivism.\n\nNext, his weight and height: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Not particularly concerning unless there's an indicator like BMI, but no info here, so probably low impact on risk factors related to these traits.\n\nHe\u2019s never married and living alone, which might suggest some independence, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk without other factors.\n\nHaving a GED: In the examples, people with GEDs sometimes had lower recidivism rates, especially if they were enrolled in college. His enrollment here is a positive sign, so maybe low risk from that factor.\n\nHe\u2019s held one job during the year; stable employment usually reduces recidivism, so probably low impact.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana but no other drugs mentioned. Past drug use can be a red flag if it's frequent or severe, but just one instance might not be high risk here.\n\nFeeling down for some time is a bit ambiguous. If this is an ongoing issue, it could indicate mental health issues which might increase risk. But in the context of a single month, maybe it's less significant unless there are other factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household size 3: Small family, which can sometimes correlate with more support or less stress, but again, without knowing if there were other issues, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering God has no influence here is a strong statement. If he doesn't believe in God and faces challenges, it might suggest resilience, which could be positive, but it's subjective and might not directly affect recidivism stats as much.\n\nPutting all together: He has one conviction (medium), GED with enrollment (low to medium), no severe drug use (low). Other factors like living alone or small household don't add much. His mental state is neutral on this point. So overall, the risk seems lower than in some examples but not certain. Maybe a low confidence of 30% that he'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED_and_enrolled_in_college\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college is associated with lower recidivism rates as seen in other examples where similar factors led to 'NO' outcomes\"),\n    (\"stable_employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests some level of stability which can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"Only marijuana use, no severe substance abuse, which is less concerning than other drug usages seen in examples where similar factors led to 'YES' outcomes\"),\n    (\"mental_health_state\", \"low\", \"Feeling down for some time could be a sign of mental health issues but without severity, it's not a strong risk factor as seen in examples with similar factors leading to 'NO' outcomes\"),\n    (\"family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household size 3 is associated with a smaller family which can sometimes correlate with lower stress and higher stability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
