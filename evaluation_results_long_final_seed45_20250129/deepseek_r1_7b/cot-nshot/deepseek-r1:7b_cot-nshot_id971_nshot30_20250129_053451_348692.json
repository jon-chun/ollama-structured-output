    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 21-year-old male who's White. He has some risk factors, and I have to assign weights to each factor based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. In the examples, most people are around that age or younger, so maybe this isn't too high of a risk. But he's been arrested once and convicted, which definitely is a red flag. That should be a high weight factor because prior convictions increase the chance of rearrest.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs, but that alone doesn't seem too concerning unless he's underweight or something, which it doesn't look like. So maybe this factor isn't very significant; perhaps low weight.\n\nNever been married \u2013 okay, not a big issue here. He's living alone, so maybe that's a medium concern because living alone is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe has a GED and is in college, which are positive factors because having education can help reduce recidivism. So this should be low weight since it's protective.\n\nHe held one job last year \u2013 not bad, but not excellent either. Maybe medium weight as employment does help, but not as much as higher education or being married.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. That\u2019s concerning because substance abuse can definitely lead to more problems and recidivism. So this should be a high weight factor.\n\nFeeling down for some time \u2013 that's a sign of mental health issues, which can contribute to substance abuse and other problems. High weight here as well.\n\nAt 21, he was living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban areas tend to have higher recidivism rates because of social and economic factors. So this is probably high weight.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal issues \u2013 that might correlate with more negative behaviors like drug use or feeling down, so maybe a medium weight since it's somewhat related but not as directly impactful as substance abuse.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), substance abuse (high), urban living (high). The rest are either neutral or protective. So the risk factors push towards a high chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years indicates potential substance abuse issues that can lead to further problems.\"),\n    (\"urban Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an urban area is associated with higher recidivism rates due to social and economic factors.\"),\n    (\"mental Health indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for some time may indicate mental health issues, though not directly linked to substance abuse as strongly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently pose a high risk but can be influenced by external factors like the prior living situation.\"),\n    (\"education and College\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college are protective factors that reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\" employment status\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job is positive, but not strongly associated with reduced rearrest compared to other factors like education or family stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
