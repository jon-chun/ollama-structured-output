She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
