    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. That seems neutral and doesn't indicate anything immediately concerning. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. Hmm, that's interesting. I know some arrestees aren't convicted, especially if the law is strict or they're dealing with serious crimes.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 lbs. That doesn't seem too extreme for an 18-year-old, unless there are any health issues, but that hasn't been mentioned here. She's never been married yet and is living alone now. That might be a risk factor because living alone can lead to mental health issues or substance abuse.\n\nShe's enrolled in school at the present moment. That suggests she has some educational background, maybe even started college. But I don't know if that's directly related to her current behavior or health problems. Also, she's holding 3 jobs during the year and has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and sometimes felt down a lot, which hasn't been addressed yet.\n\nShe's considered living with her biological father in a family of size 4 in an urban area. That could be concerning because it might lead to strained relationships or issues if they're not together. She also feels that God has something to do with her personal issues, which is interesting. Maybe she's dealing with mental health or personal struggles and attributes some things to God.\n\nPutting this all together, while she's arrested once, the lack of conviction isn't a clear red flag. The fact that she's never married yet living alone could be significant stressors. She has substance use issues and feeling down often\u2014those are serious signs of mental health problems or substance abuse. The mention of God having something to do with her personal struggles might not directly correlate to being at high risk, but it does highlight a potential area for further investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards the prediction that she's at some high risk because of her substance use history and feelings of downfall. However, without more concrete evidence like substance abuse records or a professional diagnosis, it's hard to make a certain conclusion. Maybe in the future when her behavior is documented more thoroughly, there could be a clearer indication.\n\nSo, I think the prediction should be YES for that risk factor, but the confidence level might be lower because while she has substance use issues and feels down, these aren't typically high-risk indicators on their own.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"35\"\n}",
