    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a detailed query about a risk assessment expert analyzing several factors related to the arrest of a 19-year-old male. I need to evaluate each factor and determine if it indicates high risk.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That seems neutral on race, but maybe there are other implications, though I don't think so much here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a big deal\u2014anyone caught could have serious consequences. But it's just one arrest; others might differ in severity.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, which is average for his age group. Weight of 160 lbs is also within typical ranges without issues. There's no immediate health risk from this measurement alone.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That\u2019s a bit concerning because single individuals can have various life challenges, especially if they\u2019re under the stress of being in a criminal situation. Unrequited relationships or living with someone might lead to strained relationships.\n\nHis education is a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. That could indicate some lack of further education, which might affect his future prospects. But without specific details about coursework or lack thereof, it's hard to pinpoint exact risks here.\n\nHe has held one job and used drugs four years ago with marijuana specifically during the past month. The use of marijuana is concerning because it can lead to addiction problems\u2014like withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and possibly mental health issues later on. That\u2019s definitely a significant risk factor.\n\nThe user also mentions he lived with his biological mother in a rural area and considered that God doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his personal life. This seems more about personal choice rather than any inherent risks, so it's less likely to be a significant factor.\n\nPutting this together, the most critical risk factor here is the drug use. The user has used marijuana for four years and was heavily down in the dumps for the past month, which indicates addiction. This would have severe long-term effects on his life, including mental health issues, which could lead to criminal behavior or worse. Therefore, this does indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
