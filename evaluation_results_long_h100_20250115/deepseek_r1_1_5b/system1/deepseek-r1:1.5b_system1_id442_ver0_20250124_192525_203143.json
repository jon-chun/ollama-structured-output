    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. The user is asking me to act as a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided specific risk factors and want a JSON object with the prediction and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each of the risk factors. The person is 20 years old, male, Black. He's been arrested once, convicted. He's 6'1\" and 180 lbs. Not married yet, living alone now. Enrolled in school. Has used drugs in the past four years (mostly marijuana) and has had some emotional downfalls lately. They live with their biological mother in a 6-person household in an urban area and believe God plays a role.\n\nNow, I have to assess each factor for risk. The age seems normal. Being Black might raise concerns about identity politics but not necessarily crime. Being arrested once is possible but not indicative of high risk. Weight being low could be concerning for health issues. No marriage yet means they don't face family conflicts as they grow older. Being in school suggests potential criminal activity, especially if they engage in dangerous behaviors. Having used marijuana four years ago might indicate substance use, which can lead to criminal behavior. Emotional downfalls like feeling alone and down could indicate underlying issues that might contribute to crime.\n\nI think the person is at a vulnerable age with limited information about their behavior beyond recent drug use and emotional states. The lack of substance use history isn't enough on its own but combined with past drug use and current stress, it raises some red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I believe the risk assessment points towards high risk because they have substance abuse history, emotional issues, living alone, no family conflicts yet, potential criminal behavior due to their age and limited info, and being in school could indicate higher propensity to engage in dangerous activities.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
