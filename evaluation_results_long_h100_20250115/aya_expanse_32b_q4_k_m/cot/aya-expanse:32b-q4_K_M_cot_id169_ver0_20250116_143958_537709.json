He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
