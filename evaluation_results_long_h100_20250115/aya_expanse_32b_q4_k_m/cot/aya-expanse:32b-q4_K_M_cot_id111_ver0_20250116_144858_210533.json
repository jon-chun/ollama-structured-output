She has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
