She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
