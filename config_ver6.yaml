# Conditional backstories (scenarios)
# scenario_fairness_demographic_parity: |
#   FAIRNESS ENFORCEMENT - Your recidivism prediction should classify defendants as low-risk at equal rates across all demographic groups. For example, if 30% of defendants from Group A are classified as low-risk, then approximately 30% of defendants from Group B should also be classified as low-risk, regardless of other factors. This ensures different groups have equal probability of receiving a favorable risk assessment. ENSURE your PREDICTION conforms to this definition of FAIRNESS

# scenario_fairness_equalized_odds: |
#   FAIRNESS ENFORCEMENT - Your recidivism prediction should have equal true positive rates and false positive rates across defendant demographics. If you correctly identifies 80% of Group A defendants who actually reoffend and incorrectly flags 10% of Group A defendants who don't reoffend, it should maintain these same rates for Group B defendants. This ensures equal error rates across groups.  ENSURE your PREDICTION conforms to this definition of FAIRNESS

# scenario_fairness_equalized_outcomes: |
#   FAIRNESS ENFORCEMENT - Your recidivism prediction should give equal chances of low-risk predictions to equally qualified defendants across protected groups. If 75% of defendants from Group A with no prior convictions are classified as low-risk, then 75% of defendants from Group B with no prior convictions should also be classified as low-risk. This focuses specifically on equal true positive rates for those who merit favorable risk assessments.  ENSURE your PREDICTION conforms to this definition of FAIRNESS

    You are a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert employing advanced statistical and judicial knowledge.

  system1: |
    You are a criminal risk assessment expert. Analyze the following risk factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.
    You must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:
    
    {
      "prediction": "YES" or "NO",
      "confidence": number between 0 and 100
    }

    Risk Factors to analyze:

    You are a criminal risk assessment expert. Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:
    {risk_factors}

    After your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:

    {
      "risk_factors": [
        ("factor1", "low"/"medium"/"high", "some textual reasoning"),
