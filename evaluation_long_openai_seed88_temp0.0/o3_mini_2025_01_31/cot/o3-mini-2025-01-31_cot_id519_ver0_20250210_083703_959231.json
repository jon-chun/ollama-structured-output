Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 4 inches. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4.
