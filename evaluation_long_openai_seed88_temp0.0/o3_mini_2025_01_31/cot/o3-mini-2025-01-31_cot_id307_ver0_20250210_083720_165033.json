Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 156 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
