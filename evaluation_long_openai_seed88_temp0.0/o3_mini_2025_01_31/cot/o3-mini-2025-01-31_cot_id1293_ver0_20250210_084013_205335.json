He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 152 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.

He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
