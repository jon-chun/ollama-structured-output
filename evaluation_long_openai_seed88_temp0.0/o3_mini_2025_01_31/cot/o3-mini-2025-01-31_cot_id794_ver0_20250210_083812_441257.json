Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
