    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 195 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but not necessarily a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, which isn't mentioned here. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, so this might lower risk. He's held three jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or perhaps he's exploring different career paths. Job instability can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and while it can have risks, especially if frequent or in large amounts, it's not as severe as other drugs. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Depression is a significant risk factor, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with a household size of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Believing that God has something to do with his life might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors related to mental health.\n\nPutting it all together, the main potential risk factors are the two arrests and job instability. However, the lack of convictions, stable family background, education, and absence of depression are positive indicators. The marijuana use is moderate. So, overall, while there are some factors that could indicate risk, they aren't severe enough to classify as high risk. Therefore, the prediction is NO with a confidence level of 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested twice\", \"job instability\", \"marijuana use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
