    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could still point to potential behavioral issues.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 225-249 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for mental health issues or isolation. Not being married at 20 isn't unusual, though.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect job prospects and stability, which might relate to economic factors influencing risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial stress or other underlying problems.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other behaviors or mental health issues, especially if it's frequent.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and can't be cheered up. This indicates possible depression or low mood, which is a mental health concern. Chronic feelings like this can increase risk of more severe mental health issues.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. A larger household might have meant more stress or less individual attention, which can impact mental health and behavior.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose, which might reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest, job instability, drug use, and mental health concerns (feeling down) are risk factors. However, the lack of conviction, having a high school diploma, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The overall picture leans towards some risk, but not extremely high. So, I'd predict a moderate risk, maybe a 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
