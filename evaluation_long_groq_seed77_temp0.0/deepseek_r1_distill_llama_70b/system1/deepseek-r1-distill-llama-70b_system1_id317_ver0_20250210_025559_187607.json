    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but alone it doesn't necessarily point to high risk behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, and not being married is common for his age. This doesn't seem like a significant risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having a diploma, but not attending college might limit his opportunities, which could be a risk factor for unemployment or lower income, but again, not directly a high-risk indicator.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to reliability or behavioral problems. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Recent use, especially cocaine, is more concerning than marijuana.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk factors, especially if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risky behaviors, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and mental health issues are the most concerning. The job instability and arrest are also factors, but without a conviction, the arrest is less severe. His age and living situation are less concerning. The religious belief might mitigate some risks. So, overall, there are some significant risk factors, but they might not all be high risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\", \"arrest history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
