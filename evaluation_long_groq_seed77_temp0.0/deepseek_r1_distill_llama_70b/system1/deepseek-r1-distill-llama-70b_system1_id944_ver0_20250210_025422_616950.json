    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black female. Age and race might not be direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to life stage and potential for risk behaviors.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might indicate some involvement in risky activities, but without a conviction, the severity is unclear. It's a point to consider but not definitive.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 115 lbs. These are average and don't typically pose a risk factor unless in extreme cases, which this isn't.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, but it might indicate independence or possible isolation, which can be a risk factor if it leads to lack of support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other underlying problems.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Marijuana use isn't as severe as other drugs, but any drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with daily life.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for overall well-being and can lead to other problems.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and other stressors, which might contribute to risk factors. Living with her mother suggests some family support, which is positive.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, job instability, drug use, and mental health issues are concerning. However, her arrest didn't lead to conviction, and her belief system might offer support. The other factors like age, living alone, and family background are less concerning. So, while there are risk factors present, they might not be at a high level. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 21\",\n    \"Gender: Female\",\n    \"Race: Black\",\n    \"Arrested once, no conviction\",\n    \"Height: 5'5\\\", Weight: 115 lbs\",\n    \"No high school diploma or GED\",\n    \"Not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Held 3 jobs in the past year\",\n    \"Marijuana use in the past four years\",\n    \"Felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month\",\n    \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area at a young age\",\n    \"Believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
