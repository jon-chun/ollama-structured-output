    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're related to serious offenses, but the nature of the crimes isn't specified here. However, having a conviction does suggest some level of legal trouble.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'9\" and 190 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight for his height, which might indicate possible health issues, but not directly a risk factor for behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but again, not a direct risk factor unless it's tied to employment issues.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other stressors, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor for other behaviors, but marijuana is less severe than harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can change. No indication of current mental health issues.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size three. A smaller household might mean more individual attention, which is generally positive, so not a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests and convictions are the main red flags. However, other factors like job instability and drug use are present but not as severe. The lack of depression and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to indicate a high risk overall. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"conviction\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
