    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but in this case, they don't immediately stand out as high risk. Next, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 140 lbs, which is average, so no physical risk factors there. She's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation might affect support systems, but not necessarily a direct risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact opportunities, but again, not a direct risk indicator. She's held one job in the past year, which could indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. She's felt down recently, which could point to mental health issues like depression. That's a significant factor because mental health can influence other behaviors and overall risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a small household as a child. Stable family environments are generally positive, so this might be a protective factor rather than a risk. She believes God influences her life, which can provide emotional support and isn't typically a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the arrests, recent drug use, and possible depression. However, without convictions, the arrests are less severe. The drug use is marijuana, which is less risky than harder drugs. The mental health aspect is concerning but not at a crisis level unless it's severe. Overall, these factors don't strongly indicate a high risk scenario. So, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"marijuana use\", \"recent depressed feelings\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
