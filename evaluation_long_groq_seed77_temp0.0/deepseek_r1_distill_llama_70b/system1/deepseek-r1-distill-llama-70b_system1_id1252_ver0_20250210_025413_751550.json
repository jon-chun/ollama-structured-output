Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher risk behaviors, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could still point to potential behavioral issues.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'8\" and 145 lbs. That seems underweight for his height, which might indicate possible health issues or neglect, but not directly a risk factor for behavior.\n\nHe never married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, but not having a strong support system could be a risk factor for isolation or other issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant risk factor. Lack of education can limit opportunities, leading to higher risks of unemployment, lower income, and potential involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other underlying problems.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with daily life. However, since it's only mentioned as past use, the current risk might be lower.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month. This is a positive factor, as it suggests current mental health is stable.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of four at a young age. Stable family environment as a child is a protective factor, which reduces risk.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education and job instability are significant risk factors. However, the absence of depression, stable childhood, and religious beliefs are protective. The arrest without conviction and past drug use are moderate risks. Overall, while there are some risk factors, the presence of protective factors might mitigate the overall risk. So, the prediction is NO, but with moderate confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"arrest without conviction\", \"past drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
