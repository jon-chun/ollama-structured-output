    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 22 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually correlate strongly with risk, so I won't give this much weight. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but again, not a direct risk factor. He's held three jobs in a year, which could suggest instability, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is generally a protective factor, reducing risk. He believes God influences his life, which might provide emotional support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the arrest history and drug use. However, the stable upbringing and lack of current mental health issues are positives. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" but with lower confidence, maybe around 40%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
