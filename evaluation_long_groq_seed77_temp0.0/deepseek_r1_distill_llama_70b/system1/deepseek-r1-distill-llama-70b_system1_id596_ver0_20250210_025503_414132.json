    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a point towards high risk.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 165 lbs. Physical characteristics don't really indicate risk here, so that's neutral.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes relate to stability. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which might tie into socioeconomic stability. Not having a job in the past year is a red flag because unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent, can impair judgment and increase risky behaviors. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so the impact might be moderate.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 10 in an urban area. A crowded living situation might indicate socioeconomic challenges or less individual attention, which can contribute to higher risk factors. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that's another point towards higher risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and community ties.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, unemployment, living alone, and a challenging upbringing are significant risk factors. However, his education, lack of recent depression, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence is moderate because while there are several concerning factors, there are also stabilizing elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"living alone\", \"challenging upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
