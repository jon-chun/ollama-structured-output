    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no convictions might indicate that the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some risky behavior but not necessarily a high risk of future issues.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and weighs 210 lbs. That's a high BMI, which could indicate health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment unless we're considering health risks, which might not be the focus here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is pretty common, and living with others could be a stabilizing factor, so maybe lower risk in terms of social isolation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit his future prospects, but again, not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, suggesting he might have issues with employment, which could lead to financial instability or other stressors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. Recent use, especially if frequent, is a red flag.\n\nHe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues, which can increase risk factors for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but living with family might provide some support.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use and mental health issues are significant. The job instability and arrests also contribute. However, factors like living with family and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. So, while there are definite risk factors, they might not all be at the highest level. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but maybe not the highest confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
