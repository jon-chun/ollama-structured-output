    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some issues, but without knowing the context, it's hard to gauge the severity.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 140 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for her height, but not significantly so. Her marital status is married and living with her spouse, which could be a stabilizing factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower socioeconomic status. She's held three jobs in a year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some days in the past month felt down. Marijuana use isn't as severe as other drugs, but the occasional low mood could hint at mental health issues, though not necessarily severe.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a large household in a rural area. A rural upbringing might have different challenges, but living with her mother could be a positive. She believes God influences her life, which can be a support system.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education and job instability are concerning. The arrests and marijuana use add some risk, but without convictions or harder drug use, it's moderate. Her marital status and faith might provide support, lowering the overall risk. So, I'd say moderate risk, maybe a confidence level around 60.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Age: 18\", \"Gender: Female\", \"Race: White\", \"Arrests: 2 (no convictions)\", \"Height: 5'2\\\"\", \"Weight: 140 lbs\", \"Marital Status: Married\", \"Living Situation: With spouse\", \"Education: No high school diploma or GED\", \"Employment: Held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"Drug Use: Marijuana use in the past four years\", \"Mental Health: Felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month\", \"Upbringing: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6 in a rural area\", \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
