    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but race is less of a direct indicator. Being young might mean he's still developing, which could be a risk factor if other issues are present.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism or continued risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 215 lbs. That gives him a BMI of around 31, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to various health issues, but in terms of risk assessment, it might not be directly related unless it's contributing to other factors like low self-esteem or limited opportunities.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues or isolation. Not being married at 21 isn't necessarily a risk on its own, but combined with living alone, it might indicate limited social connections.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a protective factor, but if he's enrolled but not working, it might indicate that he's not fully engaged or is struggling to balance responsibilities. Not having held any jobs in the past year could point to unemployment, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including crime and mental health issues.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be a risk factor for mental health issues and can impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of risky behaviors. Feeling down could indicate depression, which is another risk factor if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up in a household of six. A large household might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which can sometimes be a stressor, but it's not a direct risk factor on its own.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator by itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. Unemployment, drug use, and possible depression also contribute. While education is a positive factor, the lack of employment and ongoing drug use might outweigh that. The other factors like living alone and household size are less significant but could add to the overall risk in the context of the other issues.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I would predict a high risk with a confidence level of 85%. The multiple legal issues and substance use are the main drivers here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"possible depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
