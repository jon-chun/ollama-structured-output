Confidence is lowered due to:\n\n* **Limited Criminal History:**  One arrest without conviction suggests impulsivity or situational factors rather than established criminal tendencies.\n* **Age:**  19 years old is typically considered early adulthood, often characterized by exploration and potentially risky behaviors that may not translate into persistent criminal activity. \n\n**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on the provided information and should not be considered definitive. Further investigation into individual circumstances and behaviors is crucial for a comprehensive risk evaluation.",
