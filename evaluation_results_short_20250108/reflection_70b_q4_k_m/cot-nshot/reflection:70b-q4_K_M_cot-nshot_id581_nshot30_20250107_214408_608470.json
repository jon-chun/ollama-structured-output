    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes, assign weights to each factor for our specific case, and then make a prediction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the provided examples:\n   - Age: Doesn't seem to have a strong correlation with outcome\n   - Gender: Females tend to have lower recidivism rates\n   - Race: No clear pattern emerges from race alone\n   - Number of arrests: Higher number of arrests generally correlates with higher recidivism risk\n   - Conviction status: Being convicted seems to increase the likelihood of rearrest\n\n2. Assign relative weights for our specific case:\n   - Age (22): Low\n   - Gender (Female): Medium-Low\n   - Race (White): Low\n   - Number of arrests (1): Low\n   - Conviction status (Not convicted): Low-Medium\n\n3. Analyze the weighted factors for this case:\n   - The only medium factor is gender, which actually decreases recidivism risk\n   - All other factors are low risk\n\n4. Make a prediction based on analysis:\n   Given the predominantly low-risk factors and the mitigating effect of being female, I would predict NO to 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   Based on the overall low risk profile and the consistency with most female cases in the examples (14 out of 15 females had NO as their outcome), I would assign a high confidence level.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis and prediction:\n\n1. The factors were correctly identified and weighted.\n2. The gender factor, while medium-low, actually decreases recidivism risk, which supports our \"NO\" prediction.\n3. The low number of arrests (1) and lack of conviction further support this outcome.\n4. The age and race, being low-risk factors, don't strongly influence the outcome either way.\n\nOur analysis appears sound, and the conclusion aligns with the data presented in the examples. However, it's important to note that real-world recidivism prediction is more complex and involves many additional factors not present in this simplified model.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this reflection, our prediction and confidence level seem appropriate given the information provided.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"This age falls within a range that doesn't show a strong correlation with recidivism in the examples\"),\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"medium-low\", \"Females tend to have lower recidivism rates, which decreases risk\"),\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern emerges from race alone, so it's considered low risk\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (1)\", \"low\", \"A single arrest is typically a low-risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Conviction status (Not convicted)\", \"low-medium\", \"Lack of conviction generally reduces the likelihood of rearrest\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n</output>",
