    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the specific case provided.\n4. Make a prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism for the given case.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n   - Age: Generally, younger individuals (18-20) have higher recidivism rates.\n   - Race: No clear pattern emerges from the examples provided.\n   - Gender: Females tend to have lower recidivism rates in these examples.\n   - Number of arrests: Higher number of arrests correlates with higher recidivism risk.\n   - Conviction history: Being convicted appears to increase recidivism risk.\n\n2. Assigning weights:\n   - Age: medium (impact, but not consistent across all cases)\n   - Race: low (no clear pattern in examples)\n   - Gender: high (females consistently show lower recidivism rates)\n   - Number of arrests: high (strong correlation with recidivism risk)\n   - Conviction history: high (being convicted increases risk)\n\n3. Applying to the specific case:\n   - Age: 22, medium\n   - Race: White, low\n   - Gender: Female, high\n   - Number of arrests: 2, medium (not extremely high, but still a factor)\n   - Conviction history: Convicted, high\n\n4. Prediction and confidence:\n   Based on the analysis, this case presents mixed factors:\n   - Positive factors: Older age, female gender\n   - Negative factors: Multiple arrests, convicted\n   The negative factors seem to outweigh the positive ones.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while multiple arrests are a risk factor, two arrests might not be as significant as higher numbers (like 4 or more). This could slightly reduce the overall risk. Additionally, being female consistently showed lower recidivism rates in the examples provided. These factors might balance out some of the negative aspects.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this reflection, I believe my initial assessment might have been too pessimistic.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Older age typically shows lower recidivism rates, but not significantly different from other ages in examples\"),\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern of race affecting recidivism outcomes in provided examples\"),\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"high\", \"Females consistently show lower recidivism rates across all examples\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (2)\", \"medium\", \"While multiple, not an extremely high number compared to other cases\"),\n    (\"Conviction history (Convicted)\", \"high\", \"Being convicted appears to increase recidivism risk based on example patterns\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
