    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the given information about the individual and assign relative weights to various risk factors. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors based on the given information.\n2. Assign a weight (low, medium, high) to each factor along with reasoning.\n3. Evaluate the overall risk profile.\n4. Make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n5. Estimate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n1. Relevant risk factors:\n   - Age\n   - Gender\n   - Ethnicity\n   - Number of arrests\n   - Number of convictions\n\n2. Assign weights and reasoning:\n   a) Age (22): Medium to High\n      Reasoning: Young adults are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity, less life stability, and peer influence.\n\n   b) Gender (Female): Low\n      Reasoning: Generally, females have lower rates of recidivism compared to males.\n\n   c) Ethnicity (White): N/A (no specific risk associated)\n      Reasoning: No significant correlation between ethnicity and recidivism in this case.\n\n   d) Number of arrests (1): Low to Medium\n      Reasoning: Only one arrest suggests a lower risk, but it's not negligible.\n\n   e) Number of convictions (1): Low to Medium\n      Reasoning: One conviction is concerning, but the number is relatively low.\n\n3. Overall risk profile:\nThe individual has some risk factors (age, single arrest and conviction), but also protective factors (female gender). The overall risk appears moderate.\n\n4. Prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nBased on the balanced risk factors, I would predict \"NO\" for recidivism within three years.\n\n5. Confidence in prediction:\nGiven the limited information and mixed risk factors, confidence is around 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, it appears comprehensive and logically sound. The reasoning behind each factor's weight seems appropriate based on criminological research. However, I should consider that being convicted at a young age might increase the risk slightly more than initially thought. Let me adjust the prediction to reflect this:\n\nThe overall risk profile is still moderate but leaning towards lower risk. Given the individual's young age and single conviction, while there are protective factors like gender, the likelihood of recidivism is not negligible.\n\nPrediction: \"YES\" (with a low confidence)\n\nConfidence: 40%\n\nThis adjustment takes into account the potential higher risk associated with early involvement in the criminal justice system.\n</reflection>\n\nNow that I've refined my analysis, I can proceed to formulate the JSON response.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium to high\", \"Young adults are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity, less life stability, and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rates of recidivism compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"N/A\", \"No specific correlation between ethnicity and recidivism in this case\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"low to medium\", \"Only one arrest suggests a lower risk, but it's not negligible.\"),\n    (\"Number of convictions\", \"medium\", \"One conviction at a young age increases the risk slightly more than initially thought.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n</output>",
