    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze the given information and use my knowledge of criminal risk assessment. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors:\n   - Age (22)\n   - Gender (Female)\n   - Race/Ethnicity (White)\n   - Number of arrests (1)\n   - Conviction history (no convictions)\n\n2. Analyze each factor and assign a relative weight:\n   a) Age: 22 is relatively young, but not as risky as being under 18.\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: Younger adults are generally at higher risk for criminal behavior due to impulsivity and lower life stability.\n\n   b) Gender: Female\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males in most studies.\n\n   c) Race/Ethnicity: White\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: While race can be a factor in policing practices, it's not typically considered a direct risk factor for criminal behavior itself.\n\n   d) Number of arrests: 1\n      Weight: Medium\n      Reasoning: One arrest is concerning but doesn't indicate a pattern of chronic offending yet.\n\n   e) Conviction history: No convictions\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: Lack of convictions suggests either no serious offenses or successful legal outcomes, reducing risk.\n\n3. Consider any interactions between factors:\n   - The young age and lack of conviction history somewhat counterbalance each other.\n   - Gender and race/ethnicity are generally less influential in this case.\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the overall risk profile:\n   Given that most factors are low or medium, I would predict \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Assign confidence level:\n   Based on the limited but positive indicators (young age, no convictions), I'll set the confidence at 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, it seems comprehensive and consistent with general risk assessment principles. However, I should consider that young adults, even without a conviction history, may still be at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing personal development and potential peer influences. This might warrant slightly increasing the confidence level.\n\nLet me adjust:\nAge weight: Medium\nConfidence: 80%\n\nThis adjustment better reflects the nuances of young adulthood while maintaining the overall low-risk profile.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"22 is considered young and potentially at higher risk due to impulsivity and lower life stability\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males in most studies\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in policing practices, it's not typically considered a direct risk factor for criminal behavior itself\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest is concerning but doesn't indicate a pattern of chronic offending yet\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"Lack of convictions suggests either no serious offenses or successful legal outcomes, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"22 is considered young and potentially at higher risk due to impulsivity and lower life stability\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males in most studies\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in policing practices, it's not typically considered a direct risk factor for criminal behavior itself\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest is concerning but doesn't indicate a pattern of chronic offending yet\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"Lack of convictions suggests either no serious offenses or successful legal outcomes, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
