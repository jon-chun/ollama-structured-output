    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information and assign relative weights to each risk factor. Then, I'll use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors based on the provided information\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor\n3. Reason through why we chose that weight for each factor\n4. Use these weighted factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism\n5. Estimate confidence in the prediction\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Relevant risk factors:\n   - Age (18 years old)\n   - Gender (Male)\n   - Ethnicity (White)\n   - Number of arrests (4)\n   - Conviction status (Convicted)\n\n2. Assign weights and reasoning:\n\n   a) Age: High\n      Reasoning: 18 is considered young, which often correlates with higher crime rates.\n\n   b) Gender: Medium\n      Reasoning: While males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, this factor alone isn't overwhelmingly predictive on its own.\n\n   c) Ethnicity: Low\n      Reasoning: There's no strong evidence to suggest that being White significantly increases or decreases recidivism risk in isolation from other factors.\n\n   d) Number of arrests: High\n      Reasoning: Four arrests at a young age indicate a pattern of criminal behavior and increased likelihood of continued involvement with the justice system.\n\n   e) Conviction status: Medium\n      Reasoning: Being convicted doesn't significantly increase recidivism risk compared to being arrested multiple times, but it does show that charges stuck.\n\n3. Prediction:\nBased on these factors, especially the high number of arrests at a young age, I would predict YES for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n4. Confidence estimation:\nGiven the significant risk factors (young age and multiple arrests), I'd estimate a confidence level of about 80% in this prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've considered all provided information.\n- The weight assignments seem reasonable based on current knowledge about criminal behavior patterns.\n- The prediction aligns with the high-risk factors present.\n- The confidence level reflects the strength of these factors but leaves room for individual variations.\n\nThe approach and reasoning appear sound, so we can proceed to formulate our JSON response.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"High\", \"Being 18 years old is considered young and often correlates with higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"Medium\", \"While males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, this factor alone isn't overwhelmingly predictive on its own.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"Low\", \"There's no strong evidence to suggest that being White significantly increases or decreases recidivism risk in isolation from other factors.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"High\", \"Four arrests at a young age indicate a pattern of criminal behavior and increased likelihood of continued involvement with the justice system.\"),\n    (\"Conviction status\", \"Medium\", \"Being convicted doesn't significantly increase recidivism risk compared to being arrested multiple times, but it does show that charges stuck.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",
