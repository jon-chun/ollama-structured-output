    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information, consider various risk factors for recidivism, assign weights to each factor based on their relevance to the specific case, and then use these weighted factors to make a prediction. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors:\n   - Age\n   - Gender\n   - Race/Ethnicity\n   - Number of previous arrests\n   - Conviction history\n   - Time since last offense (not provided, so we'll assume recent)\n\n2. Assign weights and reasoning for each factor:\n   a) Age: 22 is considered young in the context of criminal behavior, potentially increasing risk.\n      Weight: High\n\n   b) Gender: Female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n      Weight: Low\n\n   c) Race/Ethnicity: Being White doesn't significantly influence criminal behavior.\n      Weight: Low\n\n   d) Number of previous arrests: Three arrests indicate a pattern of illegal activity.\n      Weight: High\n\n   e) Conviction history: Having been convicted at least once shows resistance to deterrence.\n      Weight: High\n\n3. Summarize and analyze the factors:\n   - Several high-risk factors (age, number of arrests, conviction history)\n   - Some low-risk factors (gender, race/ethnicity)\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis:\n   Given the presence of several high-risk factors and no known mitigating circumstances, it's likely that this individual will be rearrested within 3 years.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   The combination of multiple risk factors with only one clearly protective factor (gender) suggests a moderate to high likelihood of recidivism.\n   Confidence: 80%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and logical given the information provided. However, it's important to note that we're missing some crucial details such as:\n- Nature of previous offenses\n- Time since last offense/arrest\n- Presence of substance abuse issues\n- Level of education/employment status\n\nThese factors could significantly influence the prediction and confidence level. Without this additional information, our assessment should be considered preliminary and subject to revision if more data becomes available.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"At 22 years old, this individual is considered young in the context of criminal behavior patterns, potentially increasing their risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being White does not significantly influence criminal behavior or recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Number of previous arrests\", \"high\", \"Three arrests indicate a pattern of illegal activity and increased risk for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted at least once shows resistance to deterrence, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
