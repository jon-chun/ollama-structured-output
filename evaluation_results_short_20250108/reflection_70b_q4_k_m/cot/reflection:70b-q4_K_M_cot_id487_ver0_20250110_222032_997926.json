    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the given information about the individual and assign weights to various risk factors. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors:\n   - Age\n   - Gender\n   - Ethnicity\n   - Number of arrests\n   - Conviction history\n   - Other potential factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, family background)\n\n2. Analyze each factor and assign a weight:\n   - Age: 21 is relatively young for criminal behavior\n   - Gender: Female offenders tend to have lower recidivism rates\n   - Ethnicity: White individuals generally have lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups\n   - Number of arrests: Two arrests indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity\n   - Conviction history: No convictions may indicate less severe offenses or better legal representation\n\n3. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) based on the analysis:\n   - Age: Low risk\n   - Gender: Low risk\n   - Ethnicity: Low risk\n   - Number of arrests: Medium risk\n   - Conviction history: Low risk\n\n4. Consider any additional factors that might be relevant:\n   - Socioeconomic status and family background are unknown, so we'll focus on the provided information.\n\n5. Use these weighted factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I should also consider the potential for bias in my assessment based on limited information. The lack of conviction history might be due to various factors, not just less severe offenses or better legal representation. Additionally, while being female and White generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, individual circumstances can vary greatly.\n</reflection>\n\n6. Final prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict a low risk of rearrest within 3 years.\n\n7. Confidence level:\n   Given the limited information and potential biases in the assessment, I should assign a moderate confidence level to this prediction.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n\"risk_factors\": [\n(\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young for criminal behavior, suggesting lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female offenders tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n(\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals generally have lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups in many jurisdictions.\"),\n(\"Number of arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two previous arrests indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity, increasing the risk of future offenses.\"),\n(\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"The lack of convictions may suggest less severe offenses or better legal representation, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n],\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
