The confidence should not exceed 100 and must be directly proportional to the predicted probability.\nIn this exercise, we will use a simple algorithm that only looks at two factors: gender and ethnicity. We will assume that men are more likely to rearrest than women (75% vs. 40%) and that Hispanics are less likely to rearrest than non-Hispanic individuals (80% vs. 60%).\nWe'll also add a third factor, race, which we'll use as an \"expert\" classification variable, for the sake of this exercise. You can assume the following:\nRace is given in capital letters and will always be one of the following values: WHITE, HISPANIC or BLACK. If it's any other value or missing from the input, you should assign it as \"OTHER\".\nA race of \"WHITE\" corresponds to a 60% likelihood of rearrest while \"HISPANIC\" is an 80% and \"BLACK\" is a 75% likelihood of rearrest. If any other value or no value at all, use 100% as the likelihood of rearrest.\nYou can assume that the risk factors provided will always be in this order: [gender, ethnicity, race]. You must not make any changes to the input data and you should not process it further than necessary.\nYour task is to write a function called predict_rearrest() which takes as its only argument an array of strings containing risk factors for a person. The function should return a JSON object with the predicted likelihood of rearrest within 3 years, as well as the confidence in that prediction. You can assume that all input data will be correctly formatted and complete.\n\"\"\"",
