As an example, here is some code you can use:\n\ndef risk_assessment(person):\n    if person[\"age\"] > 100 or person[\"age\"] < 20:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"NO\", \"confidence\": 5 }\n    return { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 90 }\nYou can use the person object like this to get their age.\n\nperson[\"date_of_birth\"]\nand you can check if they were born in California by checking:\n\nperson[\"birthplace\"] == \"California\"\nHere is a second example for your convenience. You should be able to copy and paste the function into the assignment page directly when you're ready to submit.\n\ndef risk_assessment(person):\n    if person[\"convictions\"]:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"NO\", \"confidence\": 75 }\n    return { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 80 }\nGood luck!\n\"\"\"",
