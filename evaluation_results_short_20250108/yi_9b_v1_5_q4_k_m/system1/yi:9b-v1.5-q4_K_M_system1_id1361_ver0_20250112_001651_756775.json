He has completed one year of college but is not currently enrolled in any programs.\nHe does not have health insurance and does not speak English fluently.\nHe lives with his parents who are both employed. His father works as a carpenter earning $45,000 per year, while his mother works as an office manager earning $36,000 per year. He has no other sources of income besides what he earns from working part time at the grocery store.\nThe person is not currently in any kind of trouble with the law or government agencies such as Social Security Administration (SSA) or Department Of Motor Vehicles (DMV). There are no outstanding warrants for their arrest either locally or nationally. You will always be provided with an exact number of arrests, never \"more than 1\" or similar language.\nThe person does not have any known mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder which would affect risk assessment significantly if they were present. However, this fact should not change your decision on whether this individual poses a high-risk threat to public safety; rather it should only serve as additional data point that could potentially influence how much time and effort we allocate towards developing an accurate prediction model for predicting future violent incidents perpetrated by people who meet specific criteria defined within our dataset.\nThe person has no criminal history, nor any records of mental illness or substance abuse disorders which would increase their chances of committing a crime in the future (e.g., drug addiction). This information was provided in addition to what we already know about them based on other sources such as census data and public records searches but does not change our assessment in any way since no new factors were introduced that could impact likelihood of future violent behavior by this individual being true or false positive results when compared against actual events happening around him/her at time point during which prediction was made.\nThe person lives with their parents who are both employed full-time (as mentioned earlier) but do not have any known medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease etcetera that might affect ability to perform daily tasks without assistance from others including themselves; therefore there's nothing stopping them from being able participate fully in society today regardless of whether or not they live alone vs living with someone else who may also require help due aforementioned reasons mentioned previously (e.g., elderly parents).\"\"\"\n    answer = \"\"\"{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\"\"\"\n    test(q, answer)",
