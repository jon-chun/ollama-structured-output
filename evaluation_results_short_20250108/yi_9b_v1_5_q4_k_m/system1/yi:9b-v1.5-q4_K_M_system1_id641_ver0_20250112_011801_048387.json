The confidence score should be based on your analysis. Output only includes the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" for the prediction field. If you do not have enough information to make an accurate assessment, output \"NO\" with a low-confidence score (e.g. 50).\nExample:\nInput: A person who is 36 years old and has been arrested once and convicted. They currently live in a suburban area but their parents live in the suburbs as well. Their annual income is $28,000 which places them below the poverty line. They were born outside of the US and immigrated to the US when they were 17 years old so they identify themselves as American.\nOutput: { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 95 }  # This is an example output, your own prediction could be different!",
