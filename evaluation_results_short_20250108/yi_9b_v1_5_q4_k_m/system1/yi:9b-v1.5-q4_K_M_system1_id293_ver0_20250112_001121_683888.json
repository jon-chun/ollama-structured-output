Try it out in your favorite HTTP client (cURL, Insomnia, Postman, etc). You can also test your model locally by using the provided `curl` command to invoke it with the given payload:\n```sh\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data-raw '{ \"age\": 30,\"gender\": \"Male\",\"education_level\":\"Master's degree\",\"household_income\":25000.0,\"homeownerStatus\":true,\"smoker\":true,\"alcohol\":false,\"father_chd\":true }' \\\n  'https://run.mocky.io/v2/874f163e-5cac-42fb-9b0a-756eb20ef7dc?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=phpstorm%3Adisabled'\n```\nThe API endpoint you should use is: `https://run.mocky.io/v2/874f163e-5cac-42fb-9b0a-756eb20ef7dc` (replace it with your own endpoint). Your model's response must be a valid JSON object as described above, but without any additional text before or after the object itself (such as `\"` at the beginning and end of lines).\nYou are NOT allowed to use any external data sets for training purposes. You can only use the provided data set below.
