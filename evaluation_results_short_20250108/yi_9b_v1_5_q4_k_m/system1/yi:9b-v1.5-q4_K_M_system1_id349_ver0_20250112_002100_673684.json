The higher the value, the more certain it is that the person has high risk.\nInput Format\nYour program should accept as standard input an arbitrary number of lines with comma separated values (csv). Each line represents one of the factors you need to analyze.\nThe first value in each row will always be the name of the factor as they appear above, while subsequent values are the specific details for that factor.\nFor example:\nRace,White\nMaritalStatus,Single\nEducationLevel,HighSchoolOrLess\nMarijuanaUse,Sometimes\nMedicalConditions,None\nEmploymentStatus,Unemployed\nNumberOfChildren,0\nPartnersIncome,18000-35999\nNumberOfArrests,1\nConvictions,Yes\nThe first line will always be a factor name. Subsequent lines will have one or more values separated by commas.\nOutput Format\nYour program should output to standard output the final prediction and confidence score for this individual in JSON format as specified above. For example:\n{ \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 72 }\nSample Input & Output\nBelow is an example input file (input.txt) along with a sample response that you could expect from your solution program (answer.json):\nRace,White\nMaritalStatus,Single\nEducationLevel,HighSchoolOrLess\nMarijuanaUse,Sometimes\nMedicalConditions,None\nEmploymentStatus,Unemployed\nNumberOfChildren,0\nPartnersIncome,18000-35999\nNumberOfArrests,1\nConvictions,Yes\n{ \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 72 }\nYour program should accept the input.txt file as standard input and output to standard output a JSON object in answer.json format.\nNote: You can expect to receive inputs that do not make sense or are invalid in some way (such as an EmploymentStatus of \"Employed\" for someone who is 22 years old). Your solution should be able to handle these as well.",
