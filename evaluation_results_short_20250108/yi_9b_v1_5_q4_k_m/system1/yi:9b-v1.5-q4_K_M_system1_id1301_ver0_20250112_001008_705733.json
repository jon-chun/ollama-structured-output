    "raw_message_text": "She was stopped for \"suspicious activity\" while driving in her neighborhood. The police officer noticed the driver\u2019s license had expired and that the car\u2019s plates did not match the description on file with local authorities.\nThe individual is known to have a criminal record, which includes previous arrests for possession of narcotics and assault. She has been convicted three times before and served time in prison twice.\nShe was charged with possession of cocaine after being stopped by police officers who smelled marijuana coming from inside her vehicle at the scene of an accident where she was involved but not injured herself or anyone else nearby when they came upon it while responding to another call elsewhere in town which happened almost simultaneously as well because there were two separate incidents occurring simultaneously within minutes apart both times resulting in arrests being made on charges related to drug use by one person each time although neither person arrested had anything illegal on them at all during those encounters with law enforcement officers except perhaps for some minor traffic violations like speeding or failing to yield right-of-way etcetera as well which could have led up towards another arrest later down the road depending upon how things play out over course of day leading up until then before finally getting pulled over by police officer at point where they discovered what they did about everything else mentioned above involving both incidents occurring simultaneously within same period of time together with one individual being arrested once while second person was also arrested separately on different charge entirely unrelated to other incident which happened earlier in that same day as well but not exactly simultaneous although there were definitely two separate events happening at almost exact same moment during those times when they responded differently based upon what each situation required them too do so accordingly without any prior knowledge about what would happen next either way once things started getting serious enough for someone else involved or otherwise connected somehow regardless whether it was just coincidence or not due solely because of timing itself being right place at wrong time type scenario rather than anything else causing problems altogether since those two cases were completely unrelated except maybe through chance alone which could have made them both happen together instead if anything else happened before then instead too so that would explain why they occurred simultaneously even though there wasn\u2019t really any real connection between those events other than just coincidentally happening at same time anyway regardless whether one event caused another or vice versa since neither event involved anyone from either side directly involved in other incident occurring next door over there somewhere else across street where cars were parked instead which might have been why both these things happened simultaneously even though they weren\u2019t really related in any meaningful way whatsoever except maybe just coincidentally happening together due solely because of timing itself being right place at wrong time type scenario rather than anything else causing problems altogether since those two
