You do not need to catch any errors from the server side, but please make sure that any error that occurs during parsing is handled correctly on the client-side:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Invalid JSON object provided for analysis\"\n}\n```\nThe prediction should be a binary classification (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"). If you are not confident in your ability to predict with certainty, feel free to output \"UNCERTAIN\" as the prediction and assign it a confidence score of 50%. You may choose any other string for this output if that is easier.\nThe confidence should be between 0 and 100 (inclusive). If you are not confident in your ability to predict with certainty, feel free to return a confidence level of \"UNCERTAIN\" as the prediction and assign it a confidence score of 50%. You may choose any other string for this output if that is easier.\nThe following rules apply when making predictions:\n- If the person is under 18 or over 35, return `{ \"prediction\": \"UNCERTAIN\" }` with `confidence = 50`.\n- If the person has no criminal history but other risk factors (i.e. they are unemployed), return `{ \"prediction\": \"NO\" }` with confidence of at least 80%.\n- If the person has been arrested and convicted, or their race is Black/African American, return `{ \"prediction\": \"YES\" }` with a confidence score between 65% and 75%.\n- For all other cases, return an uncertain prediction: `{ \"prediction\": \"UNCERTAIN\" }` with a confidence level of at least 50% but no more than 100%.\n'''\nimport json\nfrom urllib import request\n\ndef get_risk(requested):\n    with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:\n        data = json.loads(f.read())\n    if not data['gender'] or not data[\"age_group\"] or \\\n       not data['race'] or not data['criminal_history']['arrests'] or \\\n           not data['criminal_history']['convictions']:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"INVALID INPUTS\" }\n    if data[\"gender\"] == \"Male\" and (int(data[\"age_group\"][:-1]) < 18 or int(data[\"age_group\"][:-1]) > 35):\n        return { \"prediction\": \"UNCERTAIN\", \"confidence\": 50 }\n    if data['race'] == 'White/Caucasian' and data['criminal_history']['arrests'] + \\\n                data['criminal_history']['convictions'] >= 1:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 65 }\n    elif data[\"gender\"] == \"Female\" and data['race'] != 'White/Caucasian' \\\n                and (data['criminal_history']['arrests'] + data['criminal_history'][\n            'convictions']) >= 1:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 75 }\n    elif not data[\"education\"] and data[\"gender\"] == 'Male':\n        if data[\"employment\"] is None or (data['age_group'] < 30 and data['race'] == 'White/Caucasian'):\n            return { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 50 }\n    else:\n        return { \"prediction\": \"UNCERTAIN\", \"confidence\": 100 }\n    print(data)\n\ndef run_test():\n    # Test with sample data from question.\n    with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:\n        requested = json.loads(f.read())\n    response = get_risk(requested)\n    print(json.dumps(response))\n\nrun_test()",
