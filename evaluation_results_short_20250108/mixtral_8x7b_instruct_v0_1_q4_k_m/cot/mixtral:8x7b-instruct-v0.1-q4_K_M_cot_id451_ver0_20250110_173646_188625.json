However, being female is generally associated with lower rates of reoffending, so I gave it a \"low\" weight. A single conviction still indicates some level of criminal behavior and increases the risk compared to no convictions, but since there's only one prior arrest, I assigned it a \"medium\" risk as well. My confidence level is 60 because while we have some information about this individual, predicting recidivism is complex and influenced by many factors, including those not provided in the prompt.",
