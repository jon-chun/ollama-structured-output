    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors and prediction for a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White, with one arrest and one conviction:\n\n* Age: Medium. While younger age is generally a risk factor for recidivism, this person is still in her early twenties, which is a time of significant personal growth and development.\n* Gender: Low. There is no strong evidence that gender is a major predictor of recidivism, although some research suggests that women may be less likely to reoffend than men.\n* Race: Low. While there is evidence that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, there is no clear consensus on whether race is a significant predictor of recidivism once other factors are taken into account.\n* Number of prior arrests: Medium. This person has been arrested once before, which suggests some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. However, this factor alone does not necessarily indicate a high risk of reoffending.\n* Conviction history: High. This person has been convicted of a crime, which is a strong predictor of future offending behavior.\n\nBased on these factors and their relative weights, I would predict that this person has a moderate to high risk of rearrest within the next three years. However, it's important to note that no prediction can be 100% accurate, and there may be other individualized factors that could affect this person's likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing my prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk\\_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger age is generally a risk factor for recidivism, but early twenties is still a time of personal growth and development.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"No clear evidence that gender is a major predictor of recidivism, although some research suggests women may be less likely to reoffend than men.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, there is no clear consensus on whether race is a significant predictor of recidivism once other factors are taken into account.\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest suggests some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, but does not necessarily indicate high risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction is a strong predictor of future offending behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
