    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to analyze the risk factors and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given examples. Here is my analysis:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Being 19 years old is a low risk factor as it is relatively young but not the youngest age group presented in the examples.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Identifying as male is a low risk factor, as both males and females were represented in the 'NO' and 'YES' outcome groups.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Identifying as White is a low risk factor, as individuals of all races were represented in both the 'NO' and 'YES' outcome groups.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested 1 time presents some level of risk, but it is important to note that individuals with more prior arrests were also represented in the 'NO' outcome group.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction history is a high risk factor, as all examples with a 'YES' outcome had a conviction history.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* Age (19 years old) is a low risk factor. Although it is relatively young, other individuals in the 'NO' outcome group were also as young or younger.\n* Gender (male) is a low risk factor. Both males and females were represented in both the 'NO' and 'YES' outcome groups.\n* Race (White) is a low risk factor. Individuals of all races were represented in both the 'NO' and 'YES' outcome groups.\n* Prior arrests (1 time) present a medium level of risk. Although it is true that individuals with more prior arrests had a higher likelihood of being in the 'YES' outcome group, some individuals with multiple prior arrests were still in the 'NO' outcome group.\n* Conviction history is a high risk factor. All examples with a 'YES' outcome had a conviction history. Therefore, having a conviction history significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n\nBased on these factors and their relative weights, I predict a 75% chance that this individual will have a 'YES' outcome for 3-year rearrest recidivism.",
