    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll analyze the given examples and assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the new case.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant risk factors present in the examples:\n\n1. Age (two categories: under 21 and over 21)\n2. Gender (two categories: male and female)\n3. Race/Ethnicity (three categories: White, Black, Hispanic)\n4. Number of prior arrests (three categories: 1, 2, or 3+)\n5. Conviction history (two categories: convicted or not convicted)\n\nBased on the given examples, we can assign a relative weight to each risk factor:\n\n1. Age (medium): The recidivism rate seems to be slightly higher for individuals under 21, but this factor alone does not determine the outcome.\n2. Gender (low): There is no clear trend based on gender in these examples.\n3. Race/Ethnicity (low): There is no consistent pattern of recidivism across racial or ethnic groups in these examples.\n4. Number of prior arrests (high): The number of prior arrests has a strong correlation with the likelihood of recidivism.\n5. Conviction history (medium): A history of convictions may indicate a higher risk for recidivism, but it is not as strongly correlated as the number of prior arrests.\n\nNow let's analyze the new case using these weighted risk factors:\n\n* Age: 20 years old (medium)\n* Gender: Male (low)\n* Race/Ethnicity: Black (low)\n* Number of prior arrests: 2 (high)\n* Conviction history: Convicted (medium)\n\nBased on this analysis, we can predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case with a confidence level:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Under 21 has slightly higher recidivism rate\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"No clear trend in these examples\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"No consistent pattern across racial or ethnic groups\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Strong correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"medium\", \"May indicate a higher risk for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
