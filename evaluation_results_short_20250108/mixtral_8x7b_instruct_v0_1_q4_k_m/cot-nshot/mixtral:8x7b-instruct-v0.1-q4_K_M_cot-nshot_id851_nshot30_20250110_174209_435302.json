    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll analyze the risk factors and assign a relative weight to each of them before using them to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case.\n\nHere are the weighted risk factors based on the n-shot examples:\n\n* Age (21 years old): Low, as research has shown that age is negatively correlated with recidivism, and young adults have a higher likelihood of reoffending than older individuals. However, this effect is relatively small compared to other risk factors.\n* Race (Black): Medium, as some studies suggest that Black offenders may face harsher sentencing and more limited access to social resources, increasing their likelihood of recidivism. However, this is not a universal trend and can be influenced by many other factors.\n* Gender (Male): Medium, as research has consistently shown that males have a higher likelihood of reoffending than females, due in part to differences in criminal opportunity and socialization.\n* Prior arrests (2 times): High, as having multiple prior arrests is one of the strongest predictors of recidivism. Each additional arrest increases the likelihood of future offending.\n* Conviction history (1 conviction): Medium, as having a conviction on record indicates that this individual has already been found guilty of a crime and may be more likely to reoffend than those without such records. However, one conviction is relatively low compared to multiple convictions.\n\nBased on these weighted risk factors, I would predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults have a higher likelihood of reoffending than older individuals, but this effect is relatively small.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Research suggests that Black offenders may face harsher sentencing and more limited access to social resources, increasing their likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have a higher likelihood of reoffending than females, due in part to differences in criminal opportunity and socialization.\"),\n    (\"Prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Having multiple prior arrests is one of the strongest predictors of recidivism.

Additionally, there may be other unobserved risk factors that could affect the likelihood of recidivism. However, based on the information provided and the weighted risk factor analysis, I would predict a relatively high likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual.",
