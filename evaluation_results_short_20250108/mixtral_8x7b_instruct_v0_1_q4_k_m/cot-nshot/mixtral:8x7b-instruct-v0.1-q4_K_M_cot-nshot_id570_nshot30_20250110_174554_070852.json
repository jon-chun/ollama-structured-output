    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the relative weight of each risk factor, based on the given examples and my expertise in criminal justice risk assessment:\n\n* Age: Being 21 years old is a medium risk factor, as research has shown that young adults (age 18-25) are at higher risk of reoffending compared to older individuals.\n* Race: Identifying as White is a low risk factor, as research shows that race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n* Number of Arrests: Having been arrested 2 times is a medium risk factor, as multiple arrests have been shown to increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n* Conviction status: Being convicted is a high risk factor, as it indicates that the individual has been found guilty of a criminal offense and may be more likely to reoffend in the future.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is my prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are at higher risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Research shows that race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests increase the likelihood of reoffending\"),\n    (\"Conviction status\", \"high\", \"Being convicted indicates a higher risk of reoffending\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the weighted risk factors and my expertise in criminal justice risk assessment.
