    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the examples provided and my analysis of the risk factors, here is how I would assign a relative weight to each factor for the case of a 21-year-old female who identifies as White and has been arrested 2 times but not convicted:\n\n* Age: Medium - Research has shown that young age is a risk factor for recidivism, but the effect is not as strong as other factors such as criminal history.\n* Gender: Low - While there is some evidence to suggest that gender may be related to recidivism rates, it is generally considered a weaker predictor than other factors such as criminal history and prior convictions.\n* Race/Ethnicity: Not applicable - Based on the examples provided, race/ethnicity does not appear to be a significant risk factor for recidivism in this context.\n* Number of prior arrests: Medium - Having multiple prior arrests is generally considered a risk factor for recidivism, but the effect may depend on other factors such as whether the person has been convicted or incarcerated before.\n* Conviction history: Low - While having prior convictions is certainly a risk factor for recidivism, in this case the individual has not been convicted, so this factor carries less weight.\n\nBased on these relative weights and the examples provided, I would predict that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Gender is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"not applicable\", \"Race/ethnicity does not appear to be a significant risk factor in this context\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Multiple prior arrests are a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"Lack of prior convictions suggests lower risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nNote that this prediction is based on the limited information provided and should not be considered definitive. Other factors, such as the nature and severity of the offenses for which the individual was arrested, could also impact their risk of recidivism. Additionally, it's important to remember that any predictions or assessments of recidivism risk should be used ethically and responsibly, with an emphasis on providing support and resources to help individuals succeed and avoid reoffending.",
