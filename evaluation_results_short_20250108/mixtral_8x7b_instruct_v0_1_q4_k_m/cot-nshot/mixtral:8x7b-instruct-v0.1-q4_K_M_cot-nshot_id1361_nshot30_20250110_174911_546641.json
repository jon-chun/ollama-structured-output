    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the relative weight of each risk factor in predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black and has been arrested 2 times but not convicted:\n\n* Age: Medium. Research shows that young adults are at higher risk of reoffending than older adults, but this risk decreases with age.\n* Race: Low. While there is evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, being Black alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n* Number of prior arrests: High. Multiple prior arrests are a strong predictor of future offending, especially if the individual has not been convicted and may have learned that they can avoid consequences by not getting caught.\n* Conviction history: Medium. While being convicted is associated with higher risk of recidivism, in this case the individual's lack of conviction suggests that he may be less experienced with the criminal justice system and therefore more likely to reoffend.\n\nBased on these factors, my prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are at higher risk of reoffending than older adults\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being Black alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests are a strong predictor of future offending\"),\n    (\"conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Lack of conviction suggests less experience with criminal justice system and higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is just a prediction based on the given factors, and actual outcomes can be influenced by many other factors not considered here.",
