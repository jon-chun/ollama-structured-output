    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll analyze the given examples and provide a risk assessment for the new case based on the identified risk factors with their corresponding weight. Here is my analysis:\n\nFirst, let's identify the common risk factors from the given examples and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor:\n\n1. Age: The person is 21 years old. Medium risk as younger age cohorts are more likely to reoffend.\n2. Gender: The person identifies as male. High risk as males have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\n3. Race: The person identifies as White. Low risk as research shows no significant difference in recidivism by race when controlling for other factors.\n4. Number of prior arrests: The person has been arrested 8 times. High risk as a higher number of prior arrests is associated with increased likelihood of reoffending.\n5. Conviction history: The person has been convicted. High risk as having a criminal record increases the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nNow, let's predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger age cohorts are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No significant difference in recidivism by race when controlling for other factors.\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"A higher number of prior arrests is associated with increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Having a criminal record increases the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThis means that based on the given risk factors and their corresponding weights, there is an 85% chance of this person being rearrested within three years.",
