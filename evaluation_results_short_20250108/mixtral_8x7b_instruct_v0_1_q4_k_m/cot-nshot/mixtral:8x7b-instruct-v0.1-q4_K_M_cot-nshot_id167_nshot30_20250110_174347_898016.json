    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to analyze the risk factors and assign a relative weight to each one. Here is my assessment:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is not particularly young, but it is still relatively early in adulthood\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being male is a risk factor for recidivism, but it is not as strong as other factors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being White is not a major risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested 1 time increases the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction history\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted is a strong risk factor for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nExplanation: Based on the given examples, being male and having a conviction history are both significant risk factors for recidivism. While being White is not a major risk factor, it is worth noting that most of the examples involved individuals who were either Black or Hispanic. Being young (i.e., in one's late teens) also appears to be a risk factor, but at 21 years old, this individual is somewhat older than many of the examples.\n\nOverall, I would assess the risk factors for this case as medium-high and predict that there is a 70% chance of recidivism within the next 3 years. However, it's important to note that these predictions are never 100% accurate and should be used with caution.",
