    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to analyze the risk factors and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case based on the provided examples. Here is my analysis:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is around the average age of the individuals in the examples, and a significant portion of them were rearrested within 3 years.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender appears to have little influence on recidivism rates in these examples, with both males and females being rearrested.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"While there is some variation in recidivism rates across races, it does not appear to be a strong predictor of rearrest for this particular case.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having two prior arrests puts this individual above the average number of prior arrests for those who were rearrested.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"medium\", \"Being convicted after a previous arrest may indicate a more serious criminal history, which could increase the risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* Age is a medium risk factor because most individuals in the examples were around this age when they were rearrested. While it's not a strong predictor, it does suggest that this individual is at an age where recidivism is more common.\n* Gender appears to have little influence on recidivism rates in these examples, so it is assigned as a low risk factor.\n* Race is also assigned as a low risk factor because while there are some differences in recidivism rates across races, they do not appear to be strong predictors for this particular case.\n* Prior arrests and convictions are both medium risk factors because having two prior arrests puts this individual above the average number of prior arrests for those who were rearrested, and being convicted after a previous arrest may indicate a more serious criminal history, which could increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nBased on these risk factors, I predict that there is a 60% chance that this individual will be rearrested within 3 years. However, it's important to note that this prediction is based on limited data and may not be accurate for all individuals with similar characteristics.",
