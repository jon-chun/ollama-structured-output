    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the relative weight of each risk factor based on the given examples:\n\n* Being a male seems to increase the risk of recidivism, especially for Black and Hispanic individuals. However, it is unclear whether this is a significant factor compared to other factors such as the number of arrests and convictions. I will assign it a medium weight.\n* Age does not seem to have a consistent relationship with recidivism in the given examples, so I will assign it a low weight.\n* The number of prior arrests and convictions is strongly associated with recidivism in the given examples. I will assign this factor a high weight.\n* Race seems to be a significant factor in the likelihood of recidivism, especially for Black individuals who have been arrested multiple times without conviction. However, it is unclear whether race is an independent risk factor or is confounded with other factors such as poverty and access to legal representation. I will assign it a medium weight.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the relative weights of the risk factors for the given case:\n\n* Gender: medium weight (male)\n* Age: low weight (18 years old)\n* Number of prior arrests: high weight (1 prior arrest)\n* Number of prior convictions: high weight (1 prior conviction)\n* Race: medium weight (White)\n\nHere is my prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case, based on these relative weights:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is a medium risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age (18 years old) is a low risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest is a high risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"One prior conviction is a high risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White race is a medium risk factor for recidivism, especially when combined with other risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction and confidence level are based on the given examples and my analysis of the relative weights of each risk factor. It is important to note that this prediction may not be accurate for individual cases, as there may be other factors at play that were not included in the given examples.",
