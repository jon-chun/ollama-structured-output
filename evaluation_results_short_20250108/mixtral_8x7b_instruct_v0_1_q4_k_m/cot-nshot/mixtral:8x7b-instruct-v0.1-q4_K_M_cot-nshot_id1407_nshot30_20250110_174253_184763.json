    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the relative weight of each risk factor based on the given examples:\n\n* Age: Being young (under 25) might be a medium risk factor because many of the examples involve people in this age range. However, it's important to note that there are also many examples of people in this age range who did not recidivate.\n* Gender: Based on the given examples, gender does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism. There are examples of both males and females in all outcomes.\n* Race: Based on the given examples, race also does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism. There are examples of people of all races with both outcomes.\n* Number of prior arrests: This seems to be the strongest predictor of recidivism. People with multiple prior arrests (particularly 3 or more) have a high likelihood of recidivating, while those with only 1 or 2 prior arrests have a lower likelihood.\n* Conviction history: Having a conviction in the past might be a medium risk factor for recidivism. However, it's important to note that there are also many examples of people with conviction histories who did not recidivate.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is my assessment of the relative weight and reasoning for each risk factor for the given case:\n\n* Age (18 years old): Medium risk\n\t+ Many of the examples involve young adults, so being 18 might be a medium risk factor for recidivism.\n* Gender (female): Low risk\n\t+ Based on the given examples, gender does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism.\n* Race (Black): Low risk\n\t+ Based on the given examples, race also does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism.\n* Number of prior arrests (3 times): High risk\n\t+ Having 3 prior arrests is a high risk factor for recidivism, as many of the examples with this characteristic have recidivated.\n* Conviction history (no convictions): Medium risk\n\t+ Not having any convictions might be a medium risk factor for recidivism, as some of the examples with this characteristic have recidivated.\n\nHere is my prediction and confidence level for the given case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult age range is a medium risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Based on the examples, gender does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Based on the examples, race also does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Three or more prior arrests is a high risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Not having any convictions might be a medium risk factor for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nI have set the confidence level to 70 because while the number of prior arrests is a strong predictor, the other factors (age, gender, and conviction history) are more uncertain. Additionally, it's important to note that this prediction is based on a limited sample size and may not generalize to all populations.",
