The individual's young age and Hispanic ethnicity are low-level risk factors, while their gender is also a low-risk factor due to the lower rates of recidivism among women. However, having three prior arrests increases the risk to a medium level, as it suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. The highest risk factor is having been convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the individual will be rearrested within 3 years with a confidence level of 75%.",
