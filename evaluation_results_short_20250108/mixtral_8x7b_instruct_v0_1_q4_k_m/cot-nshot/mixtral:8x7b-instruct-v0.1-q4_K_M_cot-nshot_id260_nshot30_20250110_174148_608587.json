However, for a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black and has been arrested once but not convicted, the evidence does not suggest a high risk of recidivism.\n\nHere is the assessment with relative weights and textual reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age alone is not a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being male is associated with higher rates of offending, but it's a weak factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a reliable predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but without a conviction, it's hard to assess the risk.\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest a lower risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the confidence level is 70%, it should be noted that individual assessments are inherently uncertain.
