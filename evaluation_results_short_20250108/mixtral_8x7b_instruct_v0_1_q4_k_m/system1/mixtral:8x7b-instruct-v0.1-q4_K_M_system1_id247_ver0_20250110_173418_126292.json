Age: Research indicates that young adults, particularly those aged 16-24, are at higher risk for reoffending (Siegel & Welsh, 2018).\n\n2. Gender: Although there are individual differences, studies suggest that males generally have higher rates of recidivism than females (Craig & Souryal, 2014).\n\n3. Race/Ethnicity: Research on race and crime is complex, but it should be acknowledged that systemic issues may contribute to a higher likelihood of arrest and incarceration for certain racial/ethnic groups. However, this assessment focuses primarily on the individual's criminal history.\n\n4. Criminal History: The person has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior that increases their risk for reoffending (Siegel & Welsh, 2018).\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider other factors like employment, education, mental health, family support, and community involvement when assessing an individual's risk for reoffending. This brief assessment does not account for these additional factors but should still provide a general idea of the person's potential risk.",
