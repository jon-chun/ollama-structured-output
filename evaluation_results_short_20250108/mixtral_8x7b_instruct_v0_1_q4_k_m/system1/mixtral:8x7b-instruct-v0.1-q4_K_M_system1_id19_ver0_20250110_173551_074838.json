Age: Research indicates that young adults, particularly those aged 18-24, have higher rates of offending and reoffending compared to older individuals (Sweeten, Piquero, & Steinberg, 2013). However, this factor alone does not necessarily indicate a high risk.\n2. Gender: Although males generally have higher crime rates than females, gender itself is not a strong predictor of recidivism (Fazel et al., 2016).\n3. Race: There is no evidence to suggest that race is a reliable predictor of criminal behavior or recidivism (Sampson & Laub, 2005). Therefore, this factor should not significantly impact the risk assessment.\n4. Prior arrests and convictions: The person's history of four prior arrests and at least one conviction suggests a pattern of involvement with the criminal justice system, which is associated with an increased likelihood of reoffending (Andrews & Bonta, 2010). This factor contributes significantly to the assessment of high risk.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I have determined that this individual presents a \"YES\" prediction for high risk, with a confidence level of 75.",
