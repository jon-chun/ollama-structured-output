This fact, along with her young age and lack of prior convictions, suggests a lower risk of reoffending. However, it is important to consider that a single factor, such as an arrest without a conviction, may not provide a complete picture of someone's risk. Further assessment, including an examination of other relevant factors, would be necessary to make a more informed prediction.\n\nIn this case, I am providing a confidence level of 70, which is considered moderate, since there are some risk factors present (the arrest), but they are outweighed by the lack of conviction and younger age.",
