A single arrest without a conviction is not a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. Additionally, her young age and female gender are associated with lower rates of recidivism. However, it's important to note that race alone should never be used as a risk factor in any assessment. Further evaluation is necessary to make a more accurate prediction.",
