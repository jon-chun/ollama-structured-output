While this person does have some contact with the criminal justice system, the absence of a conviction and younger age suggest a lower risk of reoffending compared to individuals with more extensive criminal histories or older age. However, it is important to consider that a single arrest may still be indicative of underlying issues, and additional assessments and support services may be beneficial for this individual.",
