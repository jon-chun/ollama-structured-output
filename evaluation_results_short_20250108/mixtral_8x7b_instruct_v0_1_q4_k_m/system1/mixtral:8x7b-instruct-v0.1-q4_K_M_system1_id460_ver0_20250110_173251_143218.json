Additionally, their age and self-reported ethnicity are not strong indicators of risk on their own. However, it is important to note that one's risk level can change over time based on new information or behavior. Therefore, I have set the confidence level at a moderate 65%, indicating some uncertainty in this assessment. Further evaluation may be necessary for a more accurate prediction.",
