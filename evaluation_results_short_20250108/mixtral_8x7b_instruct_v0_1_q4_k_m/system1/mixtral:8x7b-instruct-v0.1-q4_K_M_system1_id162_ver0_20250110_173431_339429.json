A single arrest without a conviction, age and self-identified race do not provide enough information to make a definitive high-risk prediction. However, a certain level of caution should be exercised due to the arrest record. It is essential to consider other risk factors such as criminal history, socioeconomic status, mental health, and association with negative influences before making a conclusive assessment.",
