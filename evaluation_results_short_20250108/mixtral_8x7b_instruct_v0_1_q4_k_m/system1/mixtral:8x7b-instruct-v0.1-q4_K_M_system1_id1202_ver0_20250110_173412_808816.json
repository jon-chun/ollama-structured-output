Age: Research indicates that young adults, particularly those in their late teens and early twenties, are at a higher risk of reoffending. However, this risk decreases as individuals age. (National Institute of Justice)\n2. Gender: While both males and females can pose a risk, studies have shown that male offenders are more likely to recidivate than female offenders. (Bureau of Justice Statistics)\n3. Race: There is no definitive evidence suggesting that any one race is inherently more prone to criminal behavior. However, systemic factors and socioeconomic disparities can contribute to a higher representation of certain racial groups within the criminal justice system. (The Sentencing Project)\n4. Prior arrests and convictions: An individual with multiple prior arrests and convictions is at a higher risk of reoffending than someone without such history. This risk increases with each subsequent offense. (Bureau of Justice Statistics)\n\nGiven these factors, the 22-year-old male subject who identifies as Black and has been arrested three times with prior convictions presents a moderate to high risk of recidivism. However, it is essential to consider other individualized factors and circumstances that may influence this person's risk level.",
