Age: While 21 is relatively young, it is not the youngest age group associated with high-risk behavior. However, research has shown that younger individuals are more likely to reoffend than older individuals.\n2. Gender: Studies have indicated that males are generally at a higher risk of recidivism compared to females.\n3. Number of Arrests: Two arrests may suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the risk level.\n4. Conviction History: A history of conviction indicates a confirmed engagement in criminal activity, further raising the risk level.\n5. Self-reported Race: While race should not be a standalone factor for determining risk, research has shown that certain racial and ethnic groups may have higher recidivism rates due to various socioeconomic factors. In this case, the individual identifying as White does not necessarily indicate high risk based solely on race.\n\nConsidering these factors together, there is a moderate likelihood (70%) of this individual presenting a high risk based on the provided information. However, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive assessment that includes other factors such as criminal history details, employment status, education level, family background, mental health, and substance abuse history for a more accurate prediction.",
