However, without a conviction, it is difficult to classify him as high risk with a very high degree of confidence. The fact that he has not been convicted may indicate that there were issues with the evidence or other aspects of the case against him. Additionally, while self-identified race can be a risk factor in some cases, it is not appropriate to use this as the sole or primary basis for determining risk without additional context. Overall, further information and assessment would be required to make a more informed determination of risk.",
