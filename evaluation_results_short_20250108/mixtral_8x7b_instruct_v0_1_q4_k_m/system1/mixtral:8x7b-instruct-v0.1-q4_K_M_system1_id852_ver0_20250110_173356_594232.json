Additionally, research indicates that young Black women are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated compared to their white counterparts. Therefore, it is essential to consider any systemic biases in the data used for risk assessment. However, without more comprehensive information about this individual's circumstances and behaviors, a definitive high-risk prediction cannot be made with complete confidence.",
