However, at 22, this individual is nearing the upper end of this age range.\n\n- Gender: While males generally have higher rates of offending than females, this factor alone does not indicate a high risk.\n\n- Ethnicity: There is no definitive evidence to suggest that Hispanic individuals have uniformly higher or lower risks for offending compared to other ethnic groups. However, specific socioeconomic factors within certain communities might contribute to increased risk.\n\n- Criminal history: With three arrests and at least one conviction, this individual has a more substantial criminal record than someone with no prior convictions. This factor increases the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nOverall, while there are some concerning factors in this individual's background, additional information (such as specific offense types, family history, educational attainment, and employment status) would be necessary to make a more precise assessment. The confidence level is set at 70 due to the limited nature of the provided risk factors.",
