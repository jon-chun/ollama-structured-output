This fact alone makes it difficult to classify them as high-risk, especially considering their young age and lack of conviction history. However, without additional information such as the nature of the arrest, prior juvenile records, or other relevant factors, we cannot rule out some level of risk. Therefore, a moderate confidence level is assigned to this assessment. It is essential to continue monitoring and reassessing this individual's risk level based on new information and any future interactions with the criminal justice system.",
