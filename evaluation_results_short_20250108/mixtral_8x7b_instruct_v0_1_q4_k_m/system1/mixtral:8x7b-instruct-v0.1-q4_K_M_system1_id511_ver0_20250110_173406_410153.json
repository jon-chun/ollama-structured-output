Furthermore, self-identified race should not be a factor in risk assessment as it does not directly contribute to criminal behavior. However, since the prompt includes race as a risk factor, I have considered other factors alongside it. Limited available information and potential biases in the criminal justice system must also be taken into account when making this prediction. More comprehensive data and context would increase confidence in the assessment.",
