However, young adults (ages 18-24) are disproportionately represented in crime statistics.\n- Gender: Male gender has been found to be a consistent predictor of recidivism across various studies.\n- Race: While there is no inherent reason that race should influence risk, systemic factors can contribute to higher rates of arrest and incarceration for Black individuals.\n- Prior arrests and convictions: A history of prior arrests and convictions has been consistently linked to a higher risk of recidivism. The fact that this individual has both an arrest and conviction history supports the assessment of higher risk. However, it's important to note that risk assessments should also consider factors such as the nature of the offenses, the individual's level of involvement in criminal activities, and their engagement with prosocial resources and support systems.",
