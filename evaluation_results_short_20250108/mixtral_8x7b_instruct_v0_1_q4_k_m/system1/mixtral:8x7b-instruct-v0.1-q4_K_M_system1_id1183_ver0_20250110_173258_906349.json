A single arrest and conviction at the age of 22, without additional context, does not necessarily indicate a high risk. However, societal biases and systemic issues may lead to increased scrutiny and higher likelihood of arrest for young Black males, which could contribute to an unfair assessment of their potential risk. This is an important consideration in any risk assessment process. It's crucial to continually reevaluate and improve the factors used in these assessments to minimize bias and ensure fairness.",
