However, research has shown that younger individuals are more likely to reoffend compared to older individuals.\n- Gender: No strong evidence suggests that gender alone significantly impacts the likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, being male is not a definitive indicator of high risk.\n- Race: There is no conclusive evidence suggesting that race alone affects the likelihood of reoffending. Thus, identifying as White does not contribute to a high-risk assessment.\n- Criminal history: Having one arrest and conviction indicates some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. While this increases the risk compared to someone without any criminal history, it is insufficient evidence to label this individual as high risk without further information about the nature of the offense and other circumstances surrounding their criminal behavior.",
