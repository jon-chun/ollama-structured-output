It's crucial to avoid any form of discrimination or bias when conducting risk assessments. Previous arrests and convictions are valid considerations; however, the confidence level in this case is moderate due to the limited number of risk factors presented. Comprehensive assessments should incorporate a broader set of factors for a more accurate prediction.",
