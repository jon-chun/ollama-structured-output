While the individual's young age and single arrest could indicate a higher risk, the absence of a conviction suggests a lower risk level. The individual identifying as White does not significantly impact the risk assessment, as race is not a reliable predictor of recidivism. However, further evaluation, including comprehensive psychological assessments, criminal history analysis, and socio-economic factors, would provide a more accurate risk assessment.",
