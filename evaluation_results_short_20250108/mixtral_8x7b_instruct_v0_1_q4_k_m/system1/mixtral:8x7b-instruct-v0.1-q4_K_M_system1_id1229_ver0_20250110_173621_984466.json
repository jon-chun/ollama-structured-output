The fact that she has only been arrested once and does not have a conviction indicates a lack of extensive criminal history. Additionally, being a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Black is not typically indicative of high risk. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as socioeconomic status, family background, mental health, and substance abuse in the overall risk assessment. Therefore, I set the confidence level at 70 because there might be some hidden factors we don't know yet.",
