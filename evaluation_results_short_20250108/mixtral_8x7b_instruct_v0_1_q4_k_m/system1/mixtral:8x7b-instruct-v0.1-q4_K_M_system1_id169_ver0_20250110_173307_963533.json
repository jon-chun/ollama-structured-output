Age: Research indicates that young adults, particularly those aged 18-24, are at higher risk for reoffending (Sweeten, Petchky, & Pyrooz, 2013). The person's age of 21 falls within this higher-risk category.\n2. Gender: While gender is not a strong predictor of recidivism, some studies suggest that males may have slightly higher reoffense rates compared to females (Chen & Doob, 2004).\n3. Number of prior arrests: The person's history of three arrests indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, which could be indicative of a higher risk for reoffending (Bonta & Andrews, 2017).\n4. Conviction status: Being convicted implies that the person has already been found guilty of at least one offense, which can suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending (Nagin et al., 2009).\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that risk assessment tools are not infallible and should be used in conjunction with professional judgment, case-specific information, and the individual's circumstances. This prediction should not replace a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional.\n\nReferences:\nBonta, J., & Andrews, D. A. (2017).
