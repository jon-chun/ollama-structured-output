While this individual has had some interaction with the criminal justice system, it's important to consider that he has not been convicted of any crime. However, even a single arrest can be a cause for concern and should be addressed through appropriate interventions and support services to prevent future involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe confidence level is relatively moderate due to the limited information provided about this individual's background, criminal history, and other relevant risk factors (such as employment status, education level, mental health, and substance use). Further assessment and investigation would be necessary to form a more comprehensive risk assessment.",
