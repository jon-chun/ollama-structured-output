Additionally, their young age and single arrest indicate a lower risk profile. However, it is important to consider that a single data point does not provide a complete picture of an individual's risk level. Other factors, such as the nature of the arrest and any relevant criminal history, should also be taken into account when assessing risk.\n\nIt's worth noting that race should not be used as a factor in risk assessment, as it is not a reliable predictor of future criminal behavior. In this case, the individual's self-identified race is included only as part of the provided information and is not considered in the prediction or confidence level.",
