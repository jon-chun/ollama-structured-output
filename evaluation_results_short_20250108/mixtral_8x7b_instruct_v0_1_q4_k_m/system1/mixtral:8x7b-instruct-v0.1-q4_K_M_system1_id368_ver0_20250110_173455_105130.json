The individual's age and gender are not strong indicators of risk, as criminal behavior is not determined by these factors alone. However, having one arrest but no conviction might suggest a lower level of risk, as it indicates that the person has not been found guilty of a crime. However, this is not definitive proof of non-recidivism. Therefore, I would rate my confidence at 60%. Further assessments should be conducted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this individual's risk level.",
