Additionally, their young age and status as a first-time offender could also be considered mitigating factors. However, it is important to note that a single risk factor should never be used in isolation to determine an individual's level of risk. A more comprehensive assessment would consider other factors such as the nature and circumstances of the arrest, any relevant criminal history, and any other relevant demographic or social information.",
