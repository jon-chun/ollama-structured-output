While having multiple arrests might suggest an increased risk, the lack of convictions implies that there was insufficient evidence to support guilt or other circumstances prevented conviction. However, without further information about the nature of the offenses, it is challenging to provide a more precise assessment.\n\nThe confidence level of 60% reflects the limited information available and the uncertainty around whether multiple arrests indicate an elevated risk for this individual.",
