This fact, along with her young age and the absence of a conviction history, suggests a lower risk level compared to individuals with more extensive criminal backgrounds or prior convictions. However, it is important to note that each case should be evaluated on an individual basis, taking into account all available information and context. Therefore, while I predict this person to present a lower risk, my confidence level is only 70 out of 100.",
