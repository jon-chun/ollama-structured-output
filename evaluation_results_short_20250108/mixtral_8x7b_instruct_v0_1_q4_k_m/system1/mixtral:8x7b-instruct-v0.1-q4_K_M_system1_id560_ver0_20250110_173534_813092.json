However, this age group does have some increased risk compared to younger ages.\n- Gender: Male gender is generally associated with higher rates of criminal behavior and recidivism.\n- Race: While it is inappropriate to make assumptions based solely on race, there may be some correlation between certain racial or ethnic groups and crime rates due to various social factors. In this case, limited research indicates that American Indian/Alaska Native individuals might have higher crime rates compared to other racial groups in some categories.\n- Arrest history: Two arrests are not a particularly high number; however, the fact that there were convictions suggests a pattern of criminal behavior that could indicate increased risk.\n\nOverall, while these factors do suggest some level of risk, additional information would be needed to make a more accurate assessment.",
