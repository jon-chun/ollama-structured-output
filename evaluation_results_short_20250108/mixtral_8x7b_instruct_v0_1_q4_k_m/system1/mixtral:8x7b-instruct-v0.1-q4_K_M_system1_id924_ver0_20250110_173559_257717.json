Age: Being an 18-year-old male, he falls into the high-risk category due to the peak crime rate observed in this demographic. However, age alone should not be used as a sole determinant of risk.\n2. Gender: While males have higher crime rates than females, gender itself is not a strong predictor and must be considered along with other factors.\n3. Ethnicity: Research has shown that Hispanic individuals may face different socio-economic challenges, which could contribute to increased risk. However, this factor should not be overemphasized as it can lead to biased assessments.\n4. Prior arrests and convictions: Having two prior arrests and at least one conviction indicate a higher risk. This individual has already demonstrated contact with the criminal justice system, which is a strong predictor of future offending.\n\nHowever, since only limited factors have been provided for this assessment, it's important to consider other elements such as family background, employment history, mental health status, and substance abuse in order to obtain a more comprehensive risk evaluation. The confidence level has been set at 70 due to the limited number of factors and information available for analysis.",
