This fact, along with their age and self-reported racial identity, do not indicate a high risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes. However, it is important to note that a single factor, such as an arrest, does not provide a complete picture of an individual's risk level. Other factors, such as the nature of the arrest and any relevant criminal history, should also be taken into account in a comprehensive risk assessment. Therefore, my confidence in this prediction is only moderate.",
