A single arrest without a conviction may indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it does not necessarily imply a pattern of recidivism or high-risk behavior. Additionally, the person's age and self-identified race are not strong predictors of risk when considered in isolation. However, further assessment is recommended to account for additional risk factors that may increase the likelihood of reoffending.",
