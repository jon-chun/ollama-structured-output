The individual is a young adult male, which can be associated with higher risk levels due to developmental factors. However, he has only been arrested once and has no convictions, which may suggest a lower level of involvement in criminal behavior. It is important to consider additional factors, such as the nature of the arrest and any relevant criminal history, for a more comprehensive assessment.",
