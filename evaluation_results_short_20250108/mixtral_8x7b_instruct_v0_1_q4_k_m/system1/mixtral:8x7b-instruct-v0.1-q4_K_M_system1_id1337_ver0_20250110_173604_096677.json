The individual's age (20) and gender (female) are both associated with lower recidivism rates. Additionally, having only one arrest and conviction indicates limited criminal history. However, further assessment is necessary to account for other potential risk factors such as the nature of the offense, prior involvement with the criminal justice system, and social support structure.",
