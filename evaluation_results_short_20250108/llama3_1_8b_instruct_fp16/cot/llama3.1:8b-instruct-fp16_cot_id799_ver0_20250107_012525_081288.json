    "raw_message_text": "Based on the provided information, I will assess the risk factors step by step:\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is a 21-year-old male, which typically falls into the young adult category. Research suggests that individuals in this age group are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors and have a higher recidivism rate compared to older adults (Medium).\n\n2. **Racial identity**: Identifying as White does not inherently increase or decrease the risk of rearrest. However, there is evidence suggesting that racial disparities exist within the criminal justice system. For this assessment, I will assign a neutral weight (Low) based on the provided information alone.\n\n3. **Number of arrests**: The individual has been arrested 2 times, which indicates a moderate level of prior involvement with law enforcement. This factor contributes to an increased risk of recidivism but is not conclusive on its own (Medium).\n\n4. **Conviction history**: Being convicted suggests that the individual has already faced consequences for their actions and may be more likely to reoffend due to a lack of deterrence or changed behavior (High).\n\nBased on these considerations, here is the risk assessment:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult category with increased likelihood of high-risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"Racial identity\", \"low\", \"Neutral weight based on provided information; no inherent increase in risk\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"medium\", \"Moderate level of prior involvement with law enforcement, contributing to an increased risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Increased likelihood of reoffending due to lack of deterrence or changed behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 82\n}",
