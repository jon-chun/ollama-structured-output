The focus should be on his overall behavior and history rather than just his age. \n* **Race/Ethnicity:** Low -  Factors like race or ethnicity are no longer considered reliable predictors of criminal behavior, and using them can perpetuate harmful biases.\n* **Prior Arrests:** High - Two arrests with no convictions signal a potential increase in risk due to the pattern of involvement with law enforcement.\n* **Offense Characteristics:** Low - The lack of specific offense details makes it difficult to assess further risk. \n* **Motivation and Support Systems:** High - The fact that he has not yet been convicted raises concerns about his motivation and support system, as these factors often play a significant role in recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis provides a preliminary assessment based on limited information. A more comprehensive risk assessment would require additional data such as offense details, personal history, employment status, education, family dynamics, etc. \n* The \"confidence\" level is based on the available information and could be adjusted based on more context. It's crucial to remember that predicting recidivism is complex and involves multiple factors, not just one or two.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like help with! \n",
