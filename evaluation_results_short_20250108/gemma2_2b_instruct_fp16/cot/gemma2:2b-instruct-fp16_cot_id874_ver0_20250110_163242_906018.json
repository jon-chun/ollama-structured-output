Real-world risk assessments involve many factors, including:\n\n* **Offense Severity:** The nature of the offense has an impact.\n* **Substance Abuse:** Substance abuse history can be a significant predictor. \n* **Employment & Housing Stability:**  These factors are important for successful reintegration and reducing recidivism.\n* **Social Support Networks:** Strong social support reduces risk.\n\n\nThis assessment is meant to provide a general overview, not a definitive prediction. A comprehensive risk assessment should consider all relevant information and utilize statistical models that account for these complex factors. \n",
