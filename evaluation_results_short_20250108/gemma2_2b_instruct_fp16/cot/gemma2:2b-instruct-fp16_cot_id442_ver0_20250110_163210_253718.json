This case would require more nuanced consideration based on historical context of the offender's community, specific offense committed, etc. \n* **Prior Arrest (Medium):** One prior arrest suggests some risk but not necessarily high-risk behavior. \n* **Conviction History (Low):** A single conviction doesn't automatically mean recidivism is a certainty.  \n* **Social Support (Unknown):**  Lack of information makes it impossible to assess its impact on recidivism.\n\n**Confidence:** This assessment relies heavily on the limited context provided. More comprehensive data would be required for a more accurate prediction, which is why the confidence score is 85%, acknowledging that this is an educated guess based on known factors in risk assessment tools. \n",
