However, it's not an absolute indicator and needs to be weighed against other factors. \"Medium\" weight reflects this complexity.\n* **Race:**  The individual identifies as Black, which may carry biases or social factors impacting recidivism rates. This factor is considered a high-risk factor. \n* **Arrest history:** One arrest without conviction suggests the person has not yet committed serious offenses. This is factored in with a low weight. \n* **Conviction:**  As this individual hasn't been convicted, we can't apply previous convictions as a risk factor for predicting future recidivism.\n\n\n**Note:** This assessment relies on general statistical principles and doesn't account for all factors impacting recidivism. A more comprehensive assessment would involve deeper analysis of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrest (e.g., nature of offense, social support, employment history). \n",
