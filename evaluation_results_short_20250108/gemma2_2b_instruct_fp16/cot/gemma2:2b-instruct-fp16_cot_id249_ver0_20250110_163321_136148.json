This factor carries a high weight in the assessment due to the increased likelihood of instability and involvement with risk-taking behaviors at this stage. \n* **Race/Ethnicity:**  Race is not considered a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, so it receives a low weighting.\n* **Prior Criminal History:** The one prior conviction is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, placing it in the high weight category.\n* **Convicted Offense Type:**  Without knowing the specific offense, this factor remains \"medium\" as its impact can vary significantly.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* This assessment is based on generalized statistical and judicial knowledge and should not be used for individual case decisions without a thorough evaluation of all relevant factors. \n* The confidence level (70%) reflects a moderate degree of certainty,  highlighting the need for further investigation and consideration. \n* A complete risk assessment needs to consider additional factors specific to this individual's circumstances and the nature of their conviction. \n\n\n\n",
