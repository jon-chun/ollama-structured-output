This should be further assessed.\n* **Education Level:** Lack of education is often associated with challenges in finding stable employment and support systems, which can lead to re-offending.\n\n\n**Note:** I've provided a confidence score of 80 based on the factors presented. A more precise prediction would require additional information about the nature of her previous offenses, access to rehabilitation programs, family support, and other social determinants of health and well-being. \n",
