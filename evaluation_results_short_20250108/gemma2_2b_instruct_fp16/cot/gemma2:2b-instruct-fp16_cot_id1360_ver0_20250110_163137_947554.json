However, this doesn't mean she is automatically high-risk. More information about systemic bias and the nature of those prior arrests are needed.  \n* **Prior Arrests (medium):** Two arrests, while not exceptional, suggest a possibility for recidivism given the lack of conviction. \n* **Offense Severity (low):** This factor is ambiguous without details about the offenses committed.  It's vital to have context and nature of the offenses. \n\n\n**Important Note:** It\u2019s crucial to emphasize that this assessment is based on limited information and should be considered preliminary. A comprehensive risk assessment would require additional data points, including:\n\n* Detailed information about the prior arrests (offenses, circumstances).\n* Socioeconomic background (poverty, education level, employment). \n* Mental health status and substance abuse history. \n* Support networks and community involvement. \n* Participation in rehabilitation programs or support groups.\n\n\n\nA thorough evaluation should consider each individual's unique circumstances and be tailored to the specific context of their situation.
