Studies show young adults, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, face higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals.\n* **Prior Conviction:** Having one prior conviction puts the individual at medium risk. It suggests a history of criminal behavior which usually increases the likelihood of future offenses. \n* **Gender & Race:**  These factors have minimal impact on risk in this case, based on statistical and societal trends. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This assessment is based on limited information and does not account for all potential risk factors (e.g., mental health, substance abuse).\n* It relies on general patterns observed in recidivism research. Individual circumstances may vary.\n* The \"confidence\" score reflects a subjective judgment on the strength of the current evidence base. \n\n\n",
