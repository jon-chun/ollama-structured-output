However, it\u2019s important to note that racial bias can be difficult to quantify and needs to be addressed with nuanced analysis. \n* **Prior Convictions (High):** Three prior arrests are already significant. This indicates a history of criminal behavior.   \n* **Offense Severity (Not Applicable):** Without knowing the specific nature of the offenses, it's impossible to assess this factor.\n\n**Important Note:** While these factors are statistically relevant, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that individual circumstances and contextual information significantly influence recidivism risk. This analysis only provides a preliminary assessment.  A thorough case-by-case evaluation is essential for informed decision making. \n",
