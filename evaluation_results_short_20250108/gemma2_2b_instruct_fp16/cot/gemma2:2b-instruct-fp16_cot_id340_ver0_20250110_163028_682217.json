We assign it \"medium.\" \n* **Race:**  Being Black is a significant factor that carries a high risk due to systemic biases and historical disparities in the criminal justice system. However, we need more information to make a definitive judgment.\n* **Arrested Count:** The individual has only been arrested once. This suggests they haven't engaged in serious or repeated offenses yet. We assign it \"low.\" \n* **Conviction Status:** We do not know if the person has been convicted, so we can't assess this factor.  We will need more information about their charges and court outcomes.\n* **Prior Offenses:** This is unknown as well.\n\n**Confidence Level:** The prediction of a \"NO\" for rearrest recidivism in three years based on these factors is plausible but requires further investigation, particularly regarding the individual's conviction status and history of prior offenses. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore this further with additional information! \n",
