While the individual's age, race/ethnicity, and prior convictions are all strong predictors of future criminal behavior, the specific details about the convictions (e.g., violent offenses) would be crucial for more accurate risk estimation. Further investigation into the nature of the convictions and other factors like educational attainment, employment history, substance abuse, and community ties is needed to build a more robust prediction model. \n",
