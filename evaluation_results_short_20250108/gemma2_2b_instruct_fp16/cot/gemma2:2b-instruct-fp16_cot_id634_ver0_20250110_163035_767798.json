Without this information, it's challenging to assign a definitive risk level. \n* **Employment Status:** While having employment can contribute to stability and reduce recidivism, it is not a primary indicator in isolation. \n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and relies heavily on assumptions and general trends observed in criminal justice data. \n* The prediction of recidivism is highly complex and involves many other factors beyond those listed here, including socio-economic circumstances, mental health, substance abuse history, educational attainment, and community support networks.\n* A score of 70% confidence suggests a moderate level of certainty about the recidivism prediction. However, it's important to remember that individual cases are unique, and no model can definitively predict future behavior. \n",
