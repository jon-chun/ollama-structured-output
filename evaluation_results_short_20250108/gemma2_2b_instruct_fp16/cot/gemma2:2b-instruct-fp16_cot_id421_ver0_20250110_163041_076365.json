This is considered medium risk based on the number of prior convictions. \n* **Employment Status (medium):** Stable employment, even with the individual's age, can mitigate recidivism; however, this variable is not a primary driver in this context. \n* **Substance Abuse (high):** This is a significant factor that can increase risk due to its impact on decision-making and behavior.  \n* **Mental Health Issues (medium):** A person's mental health condition may be contributing to their criminal activity, but the severity of issues or treatment plan plays a role in predicting future behavior.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and does not encompass all possible risk factors. \n*  The prediction is \"YES\" because the individual has multiple arrests.\n* The confidence level reflects the uncertainty associated with these predictions due to the complexity of criminal recidivism.  \n\n\n\n",
