A 21-year-old is still within the typical developmental stages for many individuals.  This isn't a strong risk indicator on its own.\n2. **Race/ethnicity (High):** This factor carries significant weight due to the well-documented racial disparities and systemic biases within the criminal justice system. It's important to note that this factor alone should not be used in isolation, but it does increase the potential for recidivism. \n3. **Prior arrests (High):** Having two prior arrests indicates a history of involvement with law enforcement and suggests possible patterns of behavior. This is a strong indicator of increased risk.\n4. **Conviction history (High):** A conviction signifies more serious legal violations, potentially pointing towards a higher likelihood of recidivism. \n\n\n* **Confidence:**  A confidence score of 75 indicates moderate certainty in the prediction. The model's prediction is based on these factors but should be viewed as a preliminary assessment with no guarantee of future outcomes. \n    \n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThis analysis provides a starting point, but it is essential to acknowledge that recidivism risk assessments are complex and multi-dimensional.  Additional information, such as:\n\n* **Specific offenses:** The nature and severity of the convictions matter greatly.\n* **Substance abuse:** Drug or alcohol use can increase risk. \n* **Social support networks:** Strong social connections can mitigate risk.\n* **Employment status:** Stable employment is a positive factor.\n* **Post-release programming participation:** Engaging in rehabilitation programs can reduce recidivism rates.\n\nThese factors should be considered when evaluating the individual's potential for future criminal activity. \n\n\n",
