The type of past offense would help refine risk assessment as some offenses carry a higher likelihood of recidivism than others.\n\n\n**Note:**  It's important to remember that these are just initial estimations based on general trends. A comprehensive risk assessment requires more detailed information about the individual, their circumstances, and specific crime history to make accurate predictions. \n",
