He is within a typical developmental phase, suggesting lower risk compared to older offenders.\n* **Race (low):** Race and ethnicity are not strong predictors of future criminal behavior. This factor alone doesn't significantly influence recidivism risk.\n* **Prior Arrests (medium):** One prior arrest suggests he may be at a higher risk than someone with no history, but not necessarily an indicator of future violent offenses.  \n* **Convictions (unknown):** The lack of conviction makes it difficult to assess the severity of previous offenses and their impact on recidivism. \n* **Employment History (unknown):** This factor is too broad to confidently assign a risk weight.\n* **Substance Use (unknown):** Substance abuse is correlated with recidivism, but his history of substance use is unknown, making it impossible to assess its potential influence.\n* **Education Level (unknown):** Education level doesn't have a strong predictive power on recidivism. It's difficult to say definitively without more information.\n* **Criminal History (unknown):**  This factor requires further investigation. He may lack a criminal history, or the specifics of his previous arrest would need consideration.\n\n\n**Confidence:** The high confidence score is based on the limited available data and the need for additional information about prior convictions and other crucial factors to make a more accurate prediction. \n",
