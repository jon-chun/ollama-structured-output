A thorough risk assessment would require a more comprehensive understanding of their case, including the nature of the prior convictions, the severity, underlying causes, available resources, and support systems. \n* **No Guarantee:** The prediction is based on statistical models and should not be interpreted as absolute certainty or an exclusive factor for predicting future behavior.  A holistic view and continued monitoring are essential in any risk assessment process. \n* **Legal Considerations:** This information should never be used to make decisions about someone's legal status without proper legal guidance.  Ethical considerations must always guide the application of these tools. \n\n\n\n",
