This is given a medium weight because of the individual's age and lack of significant prior history.  \n* **Prior Convictions:** The fact that he has been arrested and convicted indicates a prior history with the criminal justice system which carries a high likelihood of future re-offending.\n* **Race:**  This factor is given low weight because racial bias can heavily influence risk assessments, and this individual's race does not appear to be an overriding factor in this case. \n* **Gender:** The individual's gender is assigned low weight as it is not a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\n**Confidence:**  The prediction is based on the combined assessment of these factors, with the highest risk from his prior conviction history. A 75% confidence level reflects the probability of this prediction based on the current data.\n\n\n **Important Considerations:**\n\n* This analysis provides only a preliminary assessment and should not be considered definitive or exhaustive.\n* It's crucial to consider additional information about this individual, such as:\n    * The nature of his conviction \n    * His support network\n    * Any potential mental health conditions\n    * Employment status\n    * Substance abuse history\n\nThis is a simplified framework for risk assessment and real-world applications are significantly more complex.
