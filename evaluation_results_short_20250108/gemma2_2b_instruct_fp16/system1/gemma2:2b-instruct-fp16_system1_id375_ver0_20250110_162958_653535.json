Here's why:\n\n* **Age:** Young adults (21) often face increased impulsivity and difficulty with decision-making. \n* **Race:** While race is not directly predictive of criminality, it can be a factor in bias within the justice system which could influence judgments on risk. \n* **Criminal Record:** Three prior arrests and convictions are significant red flags. This suggests that the individual has engaged in criminal activity and likely has a pattern of behavior. \n\n**Important Considerations:**  Context is crucial. A detailed assessment would require:\n\n* **Specific charges:** The nature of the convictions matters (violent, property offenses, etc.).\n* **Offense Severity:** How serious were the prior crimes? \n* **Remorse and Rehabilitation:** Evidence of remorse or efforts toward rehabilitation can impact risk levels.\n* **Other Risk Factors:**  Social environment, personal history, mental health conditions all play a role in predicting future behavior. \n",
