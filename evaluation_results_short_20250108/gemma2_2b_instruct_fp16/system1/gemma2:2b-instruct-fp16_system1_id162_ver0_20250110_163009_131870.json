A single arrest without conviction suggests a low probability of recidivism. \n\n\nIt's important to note that a definitive prediction requires much more information such as:\n\n* **Nature of the arrest:**  Was it for minor offenses or serious crimes?\n* **History of behavioral issues:**  Does he have any history of violence, substance abuse, mental health concerns, etc.?\n* **Support systems and resources:** Does he have family support, employment, or access to rehabilitation programs? \n* **Motivations and goals:** What is his current situation, aspirations, and perceived opportunities for success?\n\nThese factors are crucial in understanding a person's risk profile and should be considered alongside any statistical analysis.  \n",
