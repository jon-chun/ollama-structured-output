This is due to historical data showing disproportionate criminal justice outcomes for young males and individuals of this specific demographic. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* **Context Matters:**  This assessment should be part of a broader risk management plan considering factors like:\n    * The nature and severity of the prior convictions \n    * Specific charges and circumstances surrounding the arrest\n    * Availability of support services (such as rehabilitation programs)\n    * Individual psychological state, history, and personal characteristics.\n\n\n",
