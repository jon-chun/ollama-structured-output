This is a strong indicator of higher risk for recidivism.\n* **Age (Medium):**  At 19 years old, he's in a period where he's likely to be more influenced by peer pressure and environment. \n* **Race (Low):** Race is not considered a reliable predictor of criminal behavior.\n\n\nWhile other factors could influence the outcome, the high arrest history makes it highly likely that this individual will reoffend. The confidence score reflects the weight given to each factor.  \n\nIt's essential to note that this analysis relies on limited information and statistical probabilities. A more comprehensive assessment would involve additional data points and expert judgment. \n",

He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
