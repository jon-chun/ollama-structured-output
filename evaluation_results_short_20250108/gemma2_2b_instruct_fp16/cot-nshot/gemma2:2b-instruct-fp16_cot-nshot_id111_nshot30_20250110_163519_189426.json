The dataset shows some bias in risk for Black individuals, but doesn't clearly indicate a strong trend in Hispanic individuals. This case is a unique situation to be further analyzed.\n* **Arrest History:** A high weight is assigned due to the number of arrests and convictions indicating a pattern of criminal behavior that raises concern. \n* **Prior Convictions:**  A high weight because past convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal activity, suggesting this individual may have difficulty maintaining positive social engagement and adherence to the law.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited data and generalized trends. It's essential to recognize that each case is unique and should be assessed individually by qualified professionals. \n* A higher confidence level doesn't mean absolute certainty; rather, it reflects a stronger prediction within the provided examples.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have more cases or would like me to analyze additional factors!",

She has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
