This factor is weighted as \"high\".\n* **Conviction History:** While the person hasn't been convicted yet, their past arrests suggest they may have a pattern of breaking laws.  This factor is weighted as \"medium\".\n* **Age:** The individual is at an age where recidivism rates can fluctuate significantly. This factor is weighted as \"low\" considering that this individual has had prior convictions, it's important to consider the time elapsed since their last conviction and its implications for future behavior. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Contextual Analysis:** It's vital to remember that these are just risk factors.  A thorough assessment should also include a comprehensive understanding of the specific individual, including social support networks, access to resources, mental health status, and any unique circumstances contributing to their situation.\n* **Data Interpretation:** The provided data is limited in scope. A larger dataset would allow for more accurate predictions by allowing the inclusion of variables such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, substance abuse history, etc. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore this further or analyze additional examples!  \n",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
