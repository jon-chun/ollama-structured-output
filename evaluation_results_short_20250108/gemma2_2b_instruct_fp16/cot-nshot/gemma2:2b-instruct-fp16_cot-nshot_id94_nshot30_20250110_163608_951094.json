This is a significant risk factor that should be given high weight.\n* **Prior Convictions:** A prior conviction indicates an increased risk, suggesting that the individual has been involved with the criminal justice system before.  This is also a medium-weighted factor. \n* **Age:** Although young age doesn't inherently predict recidivism, it does indicate a need for additional resources and support in reintegration. This is given low weight because he is already convicted.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Context Matters:** It is crucial to consider the unique circumstances of this individual, such as their social support networks, employment status, educational attainment, and any mental health challenges they might be facing. \n* **Beyond Race:** While race is a significant factor in recidivism rates, it's important to remember that other variables like socioeconomic factors, access to resources, and the quality of correctional programs also play key roles in predicting future criminal activity.  \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore further! \n",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
