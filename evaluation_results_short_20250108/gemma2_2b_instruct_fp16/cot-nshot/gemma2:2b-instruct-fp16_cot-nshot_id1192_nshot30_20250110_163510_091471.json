Given this context, we assign the risk factor \"race\" as high because Black individuals are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement and face higher recidivism rates compared to other races.  \n* **Arrest History:** While a single arrest without conviction may not be definitive, it is still a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior. We assign this factor as medium because the individual has no prior convictions.\n* **Age:** The demographic data shows that younger individuals generally face higher recidivism rates. This factor is assigned as medium because the individual is 21 years old.\n\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\nThe confidence level of 70% reflects a degree of uncertainty. Although we have assigned weights based on observed patterns, this analysis relies on limited examples and cannot guarantee accurate predictions in every case.  \n",
