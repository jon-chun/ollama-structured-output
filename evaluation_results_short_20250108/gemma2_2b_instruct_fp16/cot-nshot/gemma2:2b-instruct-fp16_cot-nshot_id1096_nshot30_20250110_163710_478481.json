The confidence level is moderate due to insufficient information regarding potential risk factors like:\n\n* **Socioeconomic Status:**  Income, education, employment history.\n* **Substance Abuse:** Presence of substance abuse issues is strongly correlated with recidivism.\n* **Mental Health:** Access to mental health services and the presence of mental illness can influence criminal behavior. \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide definitive legal or professional risk assessment advice.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White.

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
