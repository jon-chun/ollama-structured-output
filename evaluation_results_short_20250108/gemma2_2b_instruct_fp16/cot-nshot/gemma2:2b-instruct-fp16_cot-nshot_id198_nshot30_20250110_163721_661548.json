This creates a potential for recidivism bias.\n* **Arrest History:** Two prior arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, suggesting a higher likelihood of future offenses. \n* **Conviction History:** Being convicted adds another layer of risk, as it signifies that the person has already engaged in illegal activities and may not have learned from their mistakes.\n\n\n**Note:** This analysis is based on the limited data provided. More comprehensive information about the individual's circumstances, social support, and history would be needed to provide a more accurate prediction. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White.

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
