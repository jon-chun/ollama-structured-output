While specific to American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut individuals, the racial demographic itself is a significant risk factor for recidivism.  \n* **Arrests:** Two arrests suggest a possible increase in the risk of future legal issues and further criminal activity, leading to higher recidivism.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Limitations:** This analysis is based on limited data. The sample size may not be representative of all cases and doesn't account for other potential factors influencing recidivism.\n* **Context:**  Understanding the specific offenses involved (what crimes the person was arrested for) would provide a more nuanced risk assessment, as some offenses are more indicative of higher risk than others. \n* **Individualized Assessment:** This is just an initial prediction based on limited data and should not be used in isolation. A comprehensive risk assessment requires detailed information, professional judgment, and consideration of individual circumstances.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am an AI Chatbot, and this analysis should not be taken as a substitute for expert legal or criminal justice advice. \n",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
