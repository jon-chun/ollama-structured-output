Individuals with multiple arrests tend to have a higher risk of rearrest within three years compared to those without such a history. \n* **Age:** A medium weight is assigned to \"age.\" While youth can contribute to higher recidivism rates, this factor alone doesn't provide a clear enough distinction in our dataset for a high or low probability. More information on the individual's background and life circumstances would be needed.  \n\n**Important Considerations:** \n\n* **Limited Data:** The small sample size of cases makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about risk factors and recidivism. \n* **Confounding Variables:** We haven't accounted for other important variables that might influence recidivism, such as socioeconomic status, mental health, substance abuse history, education level, or access to support systems.\n\n\nLet me know if you want a deeper dive into any of the individual risk factors or their potential impact! \n",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
