The factors above are more predictive of future criminal behavior than an individual's race. \n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Contextual Factors:**  A thorough assessment requires considering other relevant contextual factors like:\n    * Current employment, education, and social support networks.\n    * Mental health status or substance abuse issues.\n    * Presence of legal representation. \n* **Statistical Limitations:** Risk assessments should be used in conjunction with a combination of data points, not as a definitive predictor. They are best viewed as tools to inform decisions about intervention strategies rather than absolute guarantees.\n\n\n\n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White.

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
