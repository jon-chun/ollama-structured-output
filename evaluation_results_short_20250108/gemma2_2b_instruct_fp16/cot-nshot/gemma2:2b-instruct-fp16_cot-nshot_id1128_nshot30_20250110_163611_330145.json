Higher conviction rates for people of color contribute to the high weighting.  \n* **Conviction history:** A prior conviction significantly increases recidivism, making this factor a high weight.\n* **Arrest history:** The one arrest is considered medium in impact due to its single nature.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis prediction relies on statistical correlations and generalizations. It's important to remember that every case is unique, and complex factors beyond the provided examples can influence recidivism outcomes. \n",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
