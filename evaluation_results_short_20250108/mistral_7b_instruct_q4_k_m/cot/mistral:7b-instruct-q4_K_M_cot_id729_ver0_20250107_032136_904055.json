However, being a young adult (20 years old) is considered a medium-risk factor as research shows that individuals in their early adulthood are at higher risk of recidivism. The most significant risk factor in this case is the arrest history, which is categorized as high-risk, given the person has been arrested twice but not convicted. Based on these factors, the prediction is NO with a confidence level of 70%.",
