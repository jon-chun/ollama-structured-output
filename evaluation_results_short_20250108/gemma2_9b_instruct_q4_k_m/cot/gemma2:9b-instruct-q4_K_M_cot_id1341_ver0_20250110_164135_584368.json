The confidence level is 60%, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in any risk assessment and the complexity of predicting human behavior.  \n\n\n **Important Note:** This assessment is based on general statistical trends and does not account for individual circumstances, rehabilitation efforts, or other mitigating factors. It should not be used as the sole basis for legal decisions.",
