There is always a chance that an individual assessed as low-risk will re-offend, and vice versa. \n* **Ethical Considerations:** It's crucial to use risk assessment tools responsibly and ethically.  They should be used to inform decision-making, not to predetermine outcomes.  Bias in data and algorithms can lead to unfair or discriminatory results. \n\n\n\n\n",
