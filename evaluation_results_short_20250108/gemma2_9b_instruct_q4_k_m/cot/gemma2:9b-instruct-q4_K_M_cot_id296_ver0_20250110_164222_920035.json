Two prior arrests suggest a potential for future criminal activity, but don't definitively predict it.\n* **Prior Convictions:** Assigned \"high\" weight. A conviction indicates a history of engaging in criminal behavior and is a strong predictor of future offenses.\n\n**Prediction & Confidence:**\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" due to the influence of the \"Prior Convictions\" factor, which carries significant weight. \n\nThe confidence level is set at 60% because while prior convictions are a strong indicator, other factors like age and the absence of specific racial or ethnic risk factors contribute to a less certain prediction.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **This is a simplified example.** Real-world risk assessments involve far more complex algorithms and a wider range of factors.\n* **Risk assessment should not be used for deterministic predictions.** It provides probabilities and should be used alongside other information in making informed decisions. \n* **Bias in data can impact risk assessment models.**  It's crucial to use validated tools and address potential bias to ensure fairness and accuracy.",
