This requires careful consideration and context.\n* **Prior Arrests (High):** Five prior arrests indicate a pattern of involvement in criminal activity, significantly increasing the risk of future offenses. \n* **Prior Convictions (High):** A conviction implies a proven instance of breaking the law, making re-offending more likely.\n\nThe overall prediction is \"YES\" due to the high weight assigned to prior arrests and convictions. However, the confidence level is only 60% because other factors like age and gender suggest a lower risk profile.  \n\n\n**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and should not be used for making definitive decisions about an individual's future behavior. Risk assessments are complex and require a thorough evaluation of various factors, including individual circumstances, the nature of past offenses, and access to support services. \n",
