This is a factor that should be considered.\n* **Race/Ethnicity (Low):** Without more specific information about the individual's racial or ethnic background, it's inappropriate to assign a weight based on potential biases.\n\n* **Prior Arrests (High):** A history of arrests strongly indicates a likelihood of future criminal activity. \n* **Prior Convictions (High):**  A conviction signifies that the individual has been found guilty of breaking the law, making them a higher risk for re-offending.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore the impact of adding more risk factors to the assessment.",
