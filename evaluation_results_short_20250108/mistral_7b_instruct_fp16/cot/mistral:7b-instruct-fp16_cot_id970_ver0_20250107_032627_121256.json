Being arrested three times is considered medium risk as there are multiple instances of the person coming into contact with law enforcement, but not necessarily all resulted in convictions. Finally, identifying as White has the lowest weight as it is not directly related to the likelihood of recidivism. Based on these factors, the prediction is that there is a 70% chance that this individual will not be rearrested within the next three years.",
