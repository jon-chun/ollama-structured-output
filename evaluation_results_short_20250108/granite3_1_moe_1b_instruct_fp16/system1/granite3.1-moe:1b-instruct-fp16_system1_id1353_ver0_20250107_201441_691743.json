This is because such individuals may be more likely to commit crimes due to their lack of experience with the legal system or other mitigating circumstances. However, it's important to note that these factors do not necessarily equate to criminal activity; they could also indicate past trauma, poverty, or mental health issues. The assessment should be made in a comprehensive and nuanced manner, considering all relevant factors.",
