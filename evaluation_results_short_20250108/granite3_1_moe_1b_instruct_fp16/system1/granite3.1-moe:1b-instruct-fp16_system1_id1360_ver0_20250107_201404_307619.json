However, this risk assessment does not indicate a high level of danger to the public due to her lack of past convictions. Her age also plays a significant role in this analysis as it may suggest lower maturity or experience compared to older criminals. While she has been arrested twice, these incidents do not necessarily equate to an ongoing risk since her record is incomplete and does not reflect any violent crimes or serious offenses that could warrant a high-risk assessment.",
