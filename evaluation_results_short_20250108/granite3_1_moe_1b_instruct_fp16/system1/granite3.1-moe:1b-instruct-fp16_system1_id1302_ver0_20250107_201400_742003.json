Age is a strong predictor of future criminality as it can be associated with less mature decision-making skills and impulsive behavior. The Black community experiences systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system, which may lead to unequal treatment and higher rates of arrest for crimes committed by individuals from this racial group. Lastly, prior criminal history often indicates a propensity towards future criminality, making this individual high-risk.",
