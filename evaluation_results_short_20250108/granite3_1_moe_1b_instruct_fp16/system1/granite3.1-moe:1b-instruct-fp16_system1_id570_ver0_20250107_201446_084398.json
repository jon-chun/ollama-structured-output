These factors include: \n\n1. Age (21 years old) - While young, this is not an inherently risky age group. \n2. Ethnicity (White) - Risk assessment models are often less sensitive to racial or ethnic differences due to larger generalization. \n3. Criminal History - The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, but these instances do not necessarily indicate high risk unless there is a history of violent offenses or other factors suggesting criminal intent. \n\nThe absence of violent crimes and the nature of his past convictions (which are typically associated with property offenses) suggests that he poses no significant threat to public safety, thus indicating low-to-moderate risk as per risk assessment criteria.",
