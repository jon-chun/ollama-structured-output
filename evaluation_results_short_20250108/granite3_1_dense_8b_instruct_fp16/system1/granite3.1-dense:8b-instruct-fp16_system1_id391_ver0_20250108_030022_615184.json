The fact that he identifies as White does not inherently indicate high risk, but it's worth noting that race alone is not a reliable predictor of criminal behavior. The history of one arrest and conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to further offenses, thus indicating a higher risk level. However, the confidence level is moderate as more contextual information would be required for a definitive assessment.",
