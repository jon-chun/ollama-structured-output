The single arrest could potentially be dismissed or result in a non-conviction, which would further reduce the risk level. However, it's important to consider other potential factors such as the nature of the alleged offense, recidivism patterns among similar demographics, and any additional contextual information that might influence this assessment. Given only the provided data, confidence in predicting high risk is low.",
