The person's age (22) suggests she might be in her late teens or early twenties, a period often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior. Her self-identified race as Black may also indicate a higher risk due to systemic biases and disparities within the criminal justice system. The fact that she has been arrested four times suggests repeat offending behavior, and her convictions further reinforce this notion. However, without additional context such as the nature of these offenses, time since last release, or any mitigating circumstances, the confidence level is set at 70%.",
