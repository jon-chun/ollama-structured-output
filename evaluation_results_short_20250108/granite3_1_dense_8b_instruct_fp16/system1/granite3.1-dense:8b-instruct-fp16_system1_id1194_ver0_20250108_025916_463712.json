Being a young male and having a prior arrest (even without conviction) can increase the likelihood of recidivism. However, it's important to consider additional context such as the nature of the offense, family background, socioeconomic status, education level, employment history, mental health, substance abuse history, and gang affiliation. Without this information, a medium-risk classification is warranted with a moderate confidence level.",
