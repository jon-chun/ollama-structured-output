However, being 21-years-old is still relatively young, so this factor alone does not warrant a high-risk prediction.\n\n- Gender (Male): Generally, males have a slightly higher rate of criminal involvement compared to females, but the impact on risk assessment is minimal when considering other factors.\n\n- Ethnicity (White): Race or ethnicity does not significantly impact risk assessment in and of itself, as crime patterns can vary among different demographics based on various social and economic factors.\n\n- Arrest History: Having been arrested once indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system but is not conclusive evidence of high risk since it does not necessarily reflect reoffending behavior or severity of crime committed.\n\n- Conviction History: One prior conviction suggests there has been some level of judicial intervention, yet it does not necessarily imply an ongoing pattern of criminal behavior or higher propensity for violence or harm to others.\n\nConsidering these factors together, the risk assessment prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
