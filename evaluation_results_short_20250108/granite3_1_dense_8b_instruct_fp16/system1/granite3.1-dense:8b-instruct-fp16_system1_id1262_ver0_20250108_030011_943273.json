However, the fact that he has been arrested once is concerning but doesn't automatically signify high risk, especially since there's no information about conviction or recidivism. The lack of conviction could imply that the charges were dropped, dismissed, or are still pending, which would lower the risk. Therefore, based on the provided information, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 75%.",
