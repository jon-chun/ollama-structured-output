The individual is young, which generally correlates with lower risk due to less life experience and fewer established patterns of behavior. Although he has been arrested once, not being convicted suggests there may be insufficient evidence or the charges were dropped, indicating a lack of serious criminal involvement. His race does not significantly contribute to risk prediction in this context. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and actual risk assessment would require more comprehensive data.",
