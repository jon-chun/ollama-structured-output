    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nBeing young (21 years old) is often associated with higher risk due to less developed impulse control and decision-making abilities. The individual's self-identified race as Black may also indicate a higher risk, as certain racial groups are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, which could be indicative of systemic issues rather than individual characteristics. Having a history of arrest (1 time) and conviction implies previous involvement in criminal activity, which generally increases the likelihood of recidivism. However, it's important to note that these factors are not definitive proof of future behavior, but they do contribute to an overall increased risk profile.\n\nThis prediction has a moderate level of confidence (65) as there is substantial evidence supporting the potential for this individual to reoffend, but without more specific information about the nature of his prior offense and other relevant factors, such as substance abuse history or mental health status, it's not possible to make a definitive high-risk assessment.",
