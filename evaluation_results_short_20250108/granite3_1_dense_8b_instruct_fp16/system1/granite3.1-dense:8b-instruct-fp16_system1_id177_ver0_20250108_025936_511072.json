The individual is an 18-year-old male, which is typically associated with higher crime rates compared to other age groups. However, the fact that he has only been arrested once and not convicted suggests that his involvement in criminal activity may be minimal or incidental. Identifying as Black could potentially indicate a higher risk due to systemic biases and disparities in the criminal justice system, but without additional context or information, this cannot be definitively stated. The confidence level is set at 30 due to the limited information provided and the need for further context to make a more accurate assessment.",
