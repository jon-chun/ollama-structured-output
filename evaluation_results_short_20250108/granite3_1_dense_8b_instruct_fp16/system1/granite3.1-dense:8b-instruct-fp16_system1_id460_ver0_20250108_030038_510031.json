Age: The person is 20 years old, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals.\n2. Gender: The individual identifies as male, but this factor alone does not significantly contribute to the risk assessment.\n3. Prior arrests and convictions: He has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests that he may not have a history of criminal behavior or that the previous incident was minor. This factor contributes to a lower risk assessment.\n4. Ethnicity: Identifying as White does not contribute significantly to the risk assessment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these factors alone cannot guarantee a definitive prediction about future criminal behavior. The confidence level is set at 65 due to the limited information and the relatively low-risk nature of the provided factors. A more comprehensive risk assessment would consider additional variables for a more accurate prediction.",
