Age: At 19, the individual is young and may be more susceptible to peer pressure or impulsive behavior, but this also suggests potential for rehabilitation.\n2. Race: The person's race does not inherently correlate with higher crime rates.\n3. Prior arrests without conviction: This indicates that the individual has been involved in criminal activity, but it is not definitive proof of future dangerousness or a high risk to reoffend, as there may be various reasons for arrests (e.g., mistaken identity, self-defense).\n\nBased on these factors, the prediction of high risk is not strongly supported. However, there is still some concern, hence the confidence level is set at 60%.",
