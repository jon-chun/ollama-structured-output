This individual's age (18), gender (male), and self-identified race (Black) do not inherently suggest high risk on their own; however, the fact that he has been arrested twice and has two convictions is a significant indicator of potential future criminal behavior. Studies have shown that prior convictions are one of the strongest predictors of future criminal activity. Therefore, based on these factors, I predict a high risk of reoffending with moderate confidence.",
