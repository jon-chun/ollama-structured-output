The individual is young, has no prior convictions, and only one arrest. While being Black could potentially be associated with higher risk due to systemic biases in the criminal justice system, without additional context or evidence of disproportionate targeting or harsher treatment, it does not significantly increase the risk assessment. The confidence level is set at 65 due to the limited information provided and the general low-risk nature of the factors mentioned.",
