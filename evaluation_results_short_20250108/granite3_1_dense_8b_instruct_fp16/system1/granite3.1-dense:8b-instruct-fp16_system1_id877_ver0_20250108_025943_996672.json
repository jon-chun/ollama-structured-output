    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nExplanation:\nAs an assistant, I must provide a nuanced and data-driven response. The risk factors provided indicate that the individual is young (22 years old), identifies as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has no other contextual information available. \n\nWhile being male and young can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates in general population statistics, these factors alone do not provide strong indications of high risk when considered individually. The single prior arrest without conviction is also less concerning than multiple offenses or a history of recidivism. Without further context such as the nature of the alleged offense, behavioral patterns, criminal history of family members, socioeconomic status, mental health history, substance abuse issues, educational background, employment history, or community ties, it is challenging to definitively classify this individual as high risk.\n\nGiven these limitations and the absence of strong risk indicators, my assessment leans towards a low-risk classification. However, I must acknowledge that confidence in this prediction is moderate due to the limited information provided (65/100). A more comprehensive evaluation with additional data points would yield a more accurate and confident assessment.",
