The age factor is somewhat neutral in its predictive power for recidivism, as young people can vary widely in their propensity to reoffend. However, the high weight given to arrest count and conviction rate suggests that there is a significant risk of rearrest within three years due to ongoing involvement with the criminal activities that led to arrests. The confidence score reflects this analysis, indicating a substantial likelihood of recidivism given these risk factors.",
