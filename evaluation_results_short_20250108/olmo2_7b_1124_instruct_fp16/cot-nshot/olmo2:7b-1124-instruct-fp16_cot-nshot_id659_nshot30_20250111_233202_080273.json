A history of arrests suggests a propensity for criminal behavior.\n- **History of convictions:** High risk factor. Those with prior convictions are more likely to reoffend.\n- **Age:** Low risk factor. Typically, individuals become less likely to reoffend as they age past their late teens and early twenties.\n- **Race/ethnicity:** Medium risk factor. While racial profiling is not a valid consideration for individual risk assessment, systemic factors could influence arrest rates differently across races.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction leans towards recidivism (YES) with high confidence (85%).",

She has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
