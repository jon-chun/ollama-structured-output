Being 19 years old might suggest less established behavior patterns, but it is not a strong indicator alone.\n- **Number of Arrests**: High risk. Having been arrested at least once is indicative of potential criminal behavior and increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n- **Conviction Rate**: Medium risk. The fact that this individual has been arrested but not convicted could mean they were acquitted, charges were dropped, or they avoided conviction for some reason. However, the act of being arrested typically represents an interaction with the criminal justice system which is itself indicative of risk.\n- **Race**: High risk. There is evidence to suggest that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, and being Black can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates, even if convictions do not follow.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 75%. This means there is a strong likelihood this individual will be rearrested for a new crime within three years.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
