The reasoning behind the high weight assigned to the number_of_arrests factor is that repeated arrests often signify a higher likelihood of reoffending. The conviction_rate is considered medium because while it indicates prior criminal behavior, only one conviction does not necessarily guarantee future offending. Age is given a low weight because although young adults generally have higher recidivism rates, age alone does not guarantee future behavior. Race is considered medium due to its potential impact in some contexts, but the dataset provided doesn't include specific details on how race affects outcomes directly, so individual behavior takes precedence.",
