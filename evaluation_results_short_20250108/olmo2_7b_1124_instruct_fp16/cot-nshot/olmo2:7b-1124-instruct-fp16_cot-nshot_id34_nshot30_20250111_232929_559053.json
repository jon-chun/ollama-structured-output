The fact that there have been arrests, although not leading to conviction in this instance, indicates a potential for continued engagement with the criminal justice system, classifying this as medium risk. Being 18 years old typically implies a lower risk profile due to age; however, this is somewhat mitigated by previous legal issues. Race/ethnicity does not appear to be a significant factor based on the provided examples.\n\nThe final prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of 75%. This means there is a moderate level of certainty that the individual will not be rearrested within three years.",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
