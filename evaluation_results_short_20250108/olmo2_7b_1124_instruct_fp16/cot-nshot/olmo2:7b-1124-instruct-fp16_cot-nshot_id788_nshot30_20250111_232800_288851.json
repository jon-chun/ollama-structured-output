The reasoning behind each risk factor's weight is as follows:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests (High):** Two arrests suggest a pattern of involvement with the criminal justice system, indicating an elevated risk of further criminal activity.\n2. **Conviction Status (Medium):** A single conviction points to some level of criminal behavior but does not necessarily establish a persistent pattern of offending.\n3. **Age (Low):** At 21 years old, this individual is at an age where there's still potential for personal growth and development away from criminal behavior.\n4. **Race/Ethnicity (Medium):** While race alone is not predictive of behavior, demographic factors can interact with socioeconomic conditions that may influence recidivism rates.\n\nThis combination of factors leads to a prediction of reoffending within three years, with a moderate level of confidence reflecting the complexity and interplay of these variables.",
