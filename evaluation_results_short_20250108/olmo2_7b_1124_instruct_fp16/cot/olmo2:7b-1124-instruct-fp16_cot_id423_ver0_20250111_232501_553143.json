The reasoning behind each assigned weight is as follows: \n\n- **Age**: High - Young individuals often have less life experience and fewer responsibilities, which can contribute to higher levels of risk.\n- **Arrest History**: Medium - A history of arrests suggests a pattern of offending behavior that could continue.\n- **Conviction**: High - Having been convicted points to an actual criminal offense, making it more likely the person will reoffend.\n- **Race**: Low - While race can be a social factor, individual behavior is a more critical determinant of recidivism. In this context, racial identity alone does not justify a high risk level.\n\nThe prediction is based on these factors and carries a 75% confidence level.",
