Youth are often at a higher risk for reoffending due to impulsivity and lack of life experience.\n- **Race (Identifies as Black)**: Medium risk. While systemic issues affect certain racial groups more than others, individual behavior is crucial.\n- **Previous Arrests**: Low risk. Being a first-time offender suggests less criminal history and entrenched patterns.\n- **Previous Convictions**: Medium risk. Having been convicted indicates a pattern of behavior that could increase the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nBased on these factors, the prediction is that there is a **YES** likelihood of reoffending within 3 years, with a **75% confidence** level in this assessment.",
