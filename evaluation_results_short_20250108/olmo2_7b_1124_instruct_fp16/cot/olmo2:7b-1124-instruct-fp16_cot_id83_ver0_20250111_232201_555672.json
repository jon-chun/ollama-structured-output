The reasoning for the assigned weights to each risk factor considers both empirical research on recidivism predictors and contextual understanding regarding the individual's situation. The prediction is based on the combination of youth being a lower risk by itself but becoming moderate when combined with gender and race, considering socio-economic contexts, and the moderate risk associated with an arrest without conviction but with the need to understand the nature of the charge for a precise assessment.",
