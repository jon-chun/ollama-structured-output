The assigned weights are \"medium\" for age due to the young age, \"low\" for race based on self-identification as White, which might not carry the same risk as other racial categories in certain contexts, \"medium\" for arrest count reflecting a single prior involvement with the criminal justice system, and \"high\" for conviction indicating a history of offending behavior.
