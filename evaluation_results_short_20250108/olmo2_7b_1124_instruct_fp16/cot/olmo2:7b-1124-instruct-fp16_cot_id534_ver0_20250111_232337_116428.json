The reasoning behind each rating is as follows:\n\n- **Age (medium)**: Young individuals may be less experienced and more impulsive.\n- **Race (medium)**: While acknowledging racial disparities, individual behavior is the primary predictor of reoffense.\n- **Arrest_count (high)**: First-time arrestees often have a higher risk of subsequent offenses as they are learning to navigate legal consequences.\n- **Conviction_status (low)**: The lack of a conviction suggests this person may not have deep entanglements with the criminal justice system, which can be associated with lower recidivism risk. \n\nPlease note that while the response adheres to the structure requested, real-world risk assessments require far more nuanced and individualized data not captured here.
