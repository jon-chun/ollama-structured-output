The confidence level in this prediction is 70%. The textual reasoning includes the fact that young adults tend to be more impulsive and less experienced, and the presence of an arrest increases the likelihood of future offending. However, since there is no conviction or information about the nature of the crime or socio-economic context, these conclusions are based on general statistical trends and not specific to this individual's case.",
