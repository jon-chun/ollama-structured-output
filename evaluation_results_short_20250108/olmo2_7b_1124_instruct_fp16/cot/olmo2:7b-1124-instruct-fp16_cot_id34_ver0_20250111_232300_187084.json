Multiple arrests show a pattern, but convictions imply some level of accountability or specific circumstances, making it less predictive of future behavior.\n- Factor 3 (\"conviction_history\") is rated as 'high'. Convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. However, the nature of these convictions (violent vs. non-violent) was not specified and could significantly alter the risk assessment.\n\nThe prediction is 'YES', suggesting a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years, with a confidence level of 75%. This reflects a somewhat cautious approach considering the individual's age and some involvement in the criminal justice system but also acknowledges the strong influence of prior convictions on the prediction.",
