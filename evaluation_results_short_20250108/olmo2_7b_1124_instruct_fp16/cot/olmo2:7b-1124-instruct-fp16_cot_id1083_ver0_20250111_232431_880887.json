The individual's age and gender are considered moderately risky due to typical behavioral patterns associated with these demographics, especially when considering recidivism rates. However, their multiple arrests and conviction history suggest a higher individual risk. The confidence in this prediction is set at 75% due to the combination of both demographic and individual behavior indicators pointing towards a higher likelihood of reoffense within three years.",
