The reasoning behind each risk factor is as follows:\n\n- **Age (medium):** Being 19, he is at an age where impulsivity and lack of life experience can influence behavior.\n- **Race (low):** While racial disparities exist, individual race does not strongly predict recidivism without additional context.\n- **Arrest history (medium):** A single arrest suggests potential for future offenses, but the lack of a conviction implies it may not have been severe or proven.\n- **Conviction status (high):** Without a conviction, this individual might not yet be entrenched in the criminal justice system, potentially limiting his exposure to its networks and influences.\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" with 65% confidence, indicating a moderately high likelihood of reoffending within three years.",
