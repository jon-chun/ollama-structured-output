According to the reasoning provided, this age group often experiences increased risk due to the transitional phase of life that includes experimenting with independence, which may lead to higher chances of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\n2. **Race**: The person identifies as White. Current data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics does not indicate a higher recidivism rate specifically linked to race for Whites compared to other racial groups. Thus, this factor is weighted as \"low.\"\n\n3. **Arrest Count**: Having been arrested once suggests initial involvement with the criminal justice system, indicating a medium level of risk. One arrest may represent a single instance of behavior that led to legal consequences, suggesting that there is a higher likelihood of subsequent arrests than someone without any criminal justice system involvement.\n\nBased on these factors, the prediction is \"YES\" for a 3-year rearrest, with a confidence level of 70%.",
