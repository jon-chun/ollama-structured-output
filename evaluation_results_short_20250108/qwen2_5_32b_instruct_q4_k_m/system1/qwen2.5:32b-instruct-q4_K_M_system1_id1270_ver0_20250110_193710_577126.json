Age (21) is often a lower-risk category, as many young individuals tend to age out of criminal behavior. Ethnicity by itself does not constitute a significant risk factor. One arrest and one conviction suggest a low level of criminal history which is generally associated with reduced future risk when no other aggravating factors are present. However, the confidence level reflects some uncertainty due to limited information provided.",
