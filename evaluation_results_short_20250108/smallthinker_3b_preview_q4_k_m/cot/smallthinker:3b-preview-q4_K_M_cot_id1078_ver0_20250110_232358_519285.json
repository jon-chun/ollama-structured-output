    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the risk factors associated with a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. Let's break down each factor and assign a relative weight before using them collectively to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **Previous Arrests**: This is a significant risk factor given the multiple arrests and convictions.\n2. **Age and Gender**: Age and gender can influence recidivism rates, but they are not as strong predictors as previous arrests.\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Race/ethnicity can be a predictor of recidivism due to systemic biases in the justice system.\n\nLet me think about each factor carefully:\n\n1. **Previous Arrests**:\n   - Given the multiple arrests and convictions, this is clearly a high-risk factor.\n   \n2. **Age and Gender**:\n   - Age 20 and being male are factors that can influence recidivism rates, but they are not as strong predictors as previous arrests.\n   \n3. **Race/ethnicity**:\n   - Being Black can be a predictor of recidivism due to systemic biases in the justice system.\n\nNow, let's assign the weights:\n\n1. **Previous Arrests**: High\n2. **Age and Gender**: Medium\n3. **Race/ethnicity**: Medium\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I am providing all necessary details. Yes, I need to provide a JSON object with the risk factors, prediction, and confidence level.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is my final response:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a high likelihood of recidivism due to the individual's history of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Age and gender can influence recidivism rates, but they are not as strong predictors as previous arrests.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Race/ethnicity can be a predictor of recidivism due to systemic biases in the justice system.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
