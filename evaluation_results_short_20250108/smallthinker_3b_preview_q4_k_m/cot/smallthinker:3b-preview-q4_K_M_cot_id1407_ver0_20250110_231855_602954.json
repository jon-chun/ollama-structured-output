    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully consider the various risk factors associated with an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black, has been arrested three times but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine her demographic characteristics. The individual's age and racial identity may contribute to her risk profile, particularly if she is part of a marginalized group that faces higher rates of arrest and incarceration. Wait, let me check the available data on this... Ah, yes, it seems that being an 18-year-old Black female could indeed be a significant factor in her risk assessment.\n\nNext, I'll consider the number of arrests she has experienced. With three arrests without conviction, it's likely that she has had multiple opportunities to engage in criminal behavior, which may indicate a pattern of risky behavior. Let me think about this... If an individual is arrested multiple times but not convicted, it could suggest that they have a tendency towards such behavior, especially if they are engaging in repeat offenses.\n\nNow, let's break down the risk factors and assign them relative weights:\n\n1. **Age and Racial Identity**: This factor seems crucial due to its impact on societal expectations and potential biases in the justice system. Given her age and racial identity, I would classify this as a \"high\" risk factor.\n2. **Number of Arrests**: With three arrests without conviction, this suggests a pattern of risky behavior. However, since she has not been convicted, it may indicate that these arrests are more related to non-violent or status offenses rather than serious crimes. Thus, I would rate this as a \"medium\" risk factor.\n3. **Frequency and Severity of Offenses**: The fact that her three arrests do not reflect convictions for severe crimes might mitigate some of the risk associated with repeat offenses. This could be considered a \"low\" risk factor.\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism... Given that she has been arrested multiple times, albeit without conviction, and considering her demographic characteristics and the frequency of her arrests, it seems plausible that she may still be at risk. However, the lack of convictions for severe crimes might suggest a lower likelihood of future violent offenses.\n\nWait a minute... Before making a final prediction, I should also consider other relevant factors such as her past behavior, socioeconomic status, and access to rehabilitation programs. Yet, based on the information provided, it appears that her demographic characteristics and arrest history are significant predictors of risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that this individual is indeed at high risk for 3-year rearrest recidivism. The combination of her age, racial identity, and multiple arrests without conviction suggests a pattern of risky behavior that may continue in the future.\n\nTherefore, my prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence level between 80% and 90%, reflecting the significant weight I assign to these risk factors in predicting her likelihood of recidivism. \n\nHere is the JSON object representing my analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_and_racial_identity\", \"high\", \"The individual's age and racial identity may contribute to her risk profile, particularly if she is part of a marginalized group that faces higher rates of arrest and incarceration.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"medium\", \"With three arrests without conviction, it's likely that she has had multiple opportunities to engage in criminal behavior, which may indicate a pattern of risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"frequency_and_severity_of_offenses\", \"low\", \"While her three arrests do not reflect convictions for severe crimes, this could suggest that these arrests are more related to non-violent or status offenses rather than serious crimes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
