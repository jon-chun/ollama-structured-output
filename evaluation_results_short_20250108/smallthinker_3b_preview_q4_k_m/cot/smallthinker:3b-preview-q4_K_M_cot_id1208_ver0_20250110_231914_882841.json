    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break this down step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key pieces of information:\n- The individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.\n- He has been arrested once and convicted.\n\nNow, I'll start by considering each factor individually:\n\n1. **Age**: Being an 18-year-old male can be a risk factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or less mature in their decision-making. However, the age range is quite broad, and 18 years old isn't extremely young compared to other groups. Therefore, I'll assign this as medium.\n\n2. **Race**: Identifying as Black can introduce social and systemic factors that might influence crime rates. This factor has a significant impact on recidivism due to racial biases in the criminal justice system. I'll categorize this as high.\n\n3. **Previous Arrest and Conviction**: Having been arrested once and convicted is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which increases the likelihood of future offenses. Therefore, this factor should be assigned a high weight.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the individual's age, race, and previous conviction, it seems likely that they will have another offense within three years. The combination of these factors suggests a significant risk.\n\nLet me check my reasoning again to ensure I haven't missed anything. The individual is young, faces systemic biases due to race, and has a history of criminal behavior. These elements collectively point towards a high risk of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may be more impulsive or less mature in their decision-making, but 18 years old is not extremely young.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"As a Black male, the individual faces systemic and social biases that may increase recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"previous_arrest_and_conviction\", \"high\", \"A conviction history can indicate a higher likelihood of future offenses.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
