    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information about a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White, has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of the arrest and conviction status. Since she has been arrested but not yet convicted, this is an early stage of the legal process. This information alone might suggest a low risk for rearrest in the next three years, as the conviction has not occurred yet. However, I need to be cautious about jumping to conclusions without considering other factors that could influence her behavior.\n\nNext, let's look at her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still relatively young and in a critical period of life development. Younger individuals may have more room for growth and change, which could affect their likelihood of reoffending. Additionally, the White ethnicity might be relevant if there are specific racial disparities in arrest and conviction rates that we need to consider.\n\nNow, let's think about her criminal history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This information is crucial because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system, which could potentially influence her future behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, this might suggest a lower risk for rearrest at this stage.\n\nLet me break down each factor and assign a relative weight:\n\n1. Age: Younger individuals might have more potential for change due to life experiences and influences.\n2. Ethnicity: White ethnicity could be relevant if there are specific racial disparities in arrest rates, but the data might not fully capture this aspect without further context.\n3. Arrest History: A single arrest indicates some level of legal involvement, but since it's not yet conviction, it may suggest a lower risk for rearrest at this stage.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I will assign the following weights:\n\n- Age: High (due to the critical period of development)\n- Ethnicity: Medium (requires more detailed analysis without specific data on racial disparities)\n- Arrest History: Low (since she hasn't been convicted yet)\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction. Given her age and limited criminal history, with no conviction, I predict a low risk for rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals may have more room for growth and change\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Requires more detailed analysis without specific data on racial disparities\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"No conviction yet, suggesting lower risk at this stage\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
