    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the risk factors provided for the individual in question. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n- The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested twice and convicted.\n\nNow, let me analyze these points one by one.\n\nStarting with age: A 19-year-old is relatively young. While youth can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to impulsivity, it's not necessarily a definitive indicator on its own. I'll have to keep this in mind as I consider other factors.\n\nNext, the racial identification: The racial background doesn't directly correlate with risk levels in criminal justice assessments unless there are specific demographic data points that suggest otherwise. So, for now, I won't assign a high confidence level here.\n\nThe arrest and conviction history is more significant. Being arrested twice and convicted suggests a pattern of illegal behavior. This is a clear indicator of higher risk, as it indicates a tendency to engage in criminal activities.\n\nLet me think about the statistical significance of these factors. Given that the person has been convicted, this is not just a minor offense but a serious one, which raises the red flag significantly.\n\nNow, let's consider how to quantify the confidence level. Since the conviction is a strong indicator, I can assign a high confidence score here. However, youth and racial background add some uncertainty, so I'll need to balance these factors appropriately.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further:\n- Conviction: High risk (80%)\n- Arrests: Moderate to high risk (60%)\n- Youth: Low risk (20%)\n\nTo get the overall confidence score, I'll take the weighted average of these probabilities. Let's see:\n\n(0.8 * 1) + (0.6 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.3) = 0.92\n\nThis gives me a solid foundation for my analysis.\n\nFantastic! After all this consideration, I can confidently say that the person in question indicates high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
