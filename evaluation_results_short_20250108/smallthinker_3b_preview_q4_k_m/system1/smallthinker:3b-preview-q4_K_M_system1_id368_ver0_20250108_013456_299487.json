    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. This alone doesn't provide much insight into his criminal behavior or potential risks. However, it does give us some context in terms of age and ethnicity.\n\nNext, we have the fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted. This is an important point to consider. Let me break this down further - a single arrest can be due to various reasons, including mistakes or misunderstandings. Conviction, on the other hand, suggests that there was sufficient evidence linking him to criminal activity.\n\nNow, let's think about the conviction rate. Without any convictions, it seems like he might have been fortunate in terms of law enforcement and legal outcomes. However, this is just one factor among many that could influence his risk level.\n\nWait a minute... Let me consider other factors that aren't provided here. For instance, does he have a history of similar offenses? Does he have any prior convictions or pending charges? Are there any family background factors that might influence his behavior?\n\nGiven the information we have, it seems like we're dealing with a relatively low-risk profile at this point. The single arrest without conviction suggests a lower likelihood of engaging in high-risk criminal activities.\n\nLet me check my confidence level here. Based on the available data and standard risk assessment protocols, I would rate my confidence as moderate to low. This is because while there are no clear red flags, we don't have enough information to fully assess his potential risks.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can now formulate my response in the required format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
