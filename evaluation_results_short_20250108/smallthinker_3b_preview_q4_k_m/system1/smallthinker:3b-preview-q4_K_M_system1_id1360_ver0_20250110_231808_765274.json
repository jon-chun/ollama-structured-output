    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the 22-year-old female of African descent who has been arrested twice but not convicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the demographic information. The age and race of an individual can influence their likelihood of being involved in criminal activities. However, without specific data on these factors, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. Let me think about this more deeply.\n\nNext, let's look at the arrest history. The fact that she has been arrested twice but not convicted suggests some level of involvement with the legal system. This could indicate a pattern of behavior or a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. However, without knowing the nature of these arrests and whether they were for similar charges or different offenses, it's difficult to assess the severity of her actions.\n\nNow, let me consider the statistical analysis aspect. With only two arrest incidents, I don't have enough data points to make a reliable prediction about future behavior. Typically, risk assessments require a larger sample size to identify trends and patterns accurately.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The limited information available means that while there are some red flags, they aren't strong enough to warrant a high-risk classification. The absence of conviction adds some uncertainty, as it could mean the individual is trying to avoid legal consequences or has not yet been found guilty of serious crimes.\n\nGiven all these factors, I need to balance the potential risks against the lack of sufficient evidence and the limited data available. It's important to remember that without more detailed information on her criminal history, arrest patterns, and demographic context, it's premature to classify this individual as high-risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my conclusion is that while there are some indicators of potential involvement with law enforcement, they do not warrant a high-risk classification based solely on the provided risk factors.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
