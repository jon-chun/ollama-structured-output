    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n- The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested once but has not been convicted.\n\nLet me check the criteria for high-risk assessment in criminal justice. Typically, risk factors include age, gender, race, prior arrests, and conviction history among others. In this case, we have limited information, so I'll need to make some assumptions based on general trends.\n\nWait a minute... at 19 years old, the person is still a minor in many jurisdictions, which might affect how their actions are perceived or handled by the legal system. This could be a significant factor if they were involved in serious offenses, but since there's no conviction, it seems more likely that this arrest was for a less severe offense.\n\nNow, let me think about the confidence level. Given the limited information provided, I can't make a definitive judgment about high risk. However, considering the person's age and lack of conviction, I would place my confidence at around 50%. This is because while there are some red flags, such as an arrest record, they don't necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nFantastic! After careful consideration, I can confidently say that based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine high risk with certainty. Therefore, my prediction would be NO, and my confidence level would be 50%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
