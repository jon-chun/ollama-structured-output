    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the risk factors provided and evaluate them against established criteria for high-risk assessments in criminal justice. Let me break down each factor and think through it step-by-step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. While age and race can be relevant factors, they are generally not strong indicators of risk on their own. However, let's consider them in context with other factors. Age might suggest impulsivity or lack of life experience, while race could imply biases in the justice system, but these are secondary considerations.\n\nNext, the individual has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. This is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which is a significant risk factor. Convictions often correlate with future criminal activity, indicating a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNow, let's think about the confidence level in our assessment. Given that convictions are a strong predictor of recidivism, and considering the limited context provided (only one arrest and conviction), we can be quite confident in our prediction.\n\nLet me check the scoring system to ensure accuracy. The score should reflect the severity of past offenses and the likelihood of future crimes based on similar cases. Since there's only one incident documented, the confidence level is moderate but still high enough to warrant a YES for high risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the individual indicates a high risk based on her past criminal behavior and age/race factors.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
