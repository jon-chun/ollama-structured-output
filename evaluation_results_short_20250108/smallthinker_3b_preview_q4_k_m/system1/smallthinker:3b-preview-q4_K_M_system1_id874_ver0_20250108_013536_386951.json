    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk for criminal behavior. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the information given:\n- The individual is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested once.\n- He has also been convicted.\n\nNow, let's consider each factor individually and then combine them to form an overall assessment.\n\nLet me check the arrest record first. An arrest does not necessarily mean the person will commit future crimes; it could be a one-time mistake or a symptom of deeper issues. However, it is still a significant risk factor that needs careful consideration.\n\nNext, the conviction adds another layer of complexity. A conviction typically indicates a pattern of criminal behavior and suggests that the individual has already demonstrated a willingness to engage in illegal activities. This is a strong indicator of potential future criminal activity.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors combine. The age of 21 is generally considered young enough that there are still many years ahead for development and rehabilitation. However, the combination of an arrest and a conviction suggests a higher risk compared to someone with no such history.\n\nWait a minute... I need to balance the potential benefits of rehabilitation against the clear indicators of past criminal behavior. Given the information provided, it seems reasonable to conclude that these factors do indeed indicate high risk for future criminal activity.\n\nFantastic! After all this analysis, I can confidently say that the risk factors present a strong indication of high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
