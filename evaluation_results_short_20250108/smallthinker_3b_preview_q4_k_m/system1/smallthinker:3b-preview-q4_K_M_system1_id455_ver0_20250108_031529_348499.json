    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess the given risk factors for a high-risk prediction. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information. The individual is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. While age and gender are not typically significant predictors of criminal behavior on their own, they can be part of a broader profile that might influence risk assessment in certain contexts. However, without specific indicators of problematic behavior, these factors alone do not suggest high-risk status.\n\nNext, let's examine the arrest history. The person has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is an important factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the justice system. However, since there is no conviction, this does not necessarily elevate the risk level to \"high.\" In many cases, first-time arrests can be seen as a learning experience or a phase in an individual's life that may not lead to further criminal activity.\n\nNow, let me break down the overall assessment. The age and gender are relatively neutral factors without clear indicators of problematic behavior. The single arrest is notable but does not rise to the level of indicating high-risk behavior, especially given the lack of conviction.\n\nWait a minute... Let me check if there's anything else that could be considered here. Are there any other risk factors mentioned? No, only age, gender, and arrest history are provided. This means I have to rely solely on these factors for my assessment.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the provided information does not strongly suggest a high-risk prediction. The lack of conviction is particularly important here because it suggests that the individual has had some form of engagement with the justice system but may not be engaging in harmful behavior at that point.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can confidently say that based on the given risk factors, there are no strong indicators of high-risk behavior. Therefore, my prediction is \"NO,\" and my confidence level is 50%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
