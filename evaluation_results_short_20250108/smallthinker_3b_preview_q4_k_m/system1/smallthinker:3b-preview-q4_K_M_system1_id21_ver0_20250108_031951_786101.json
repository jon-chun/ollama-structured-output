    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors provided and think through them step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age factor. The individual is only 22 years old, which means he or she is still a young adult. Young adults are generally more susceptible to impulsive behavior and less experienced in navigating complex social situations. This suggests that youth could be a significant risk factor here.\n\nNext, I'll think about the Hispanic ethnicity. There's no direct correlation between ethnicity and criminal behavior based on this information alone. However, it's important to note that cultural and socioeconomic factors can influence an individual's actions and interactions with the legal system. Since there's no specific data linking Hispanic ethnicity to higher crime rates in this context, I won't assign a high risk level based solely on ethnicity.\n\nNow, let me consider the arrest history. The person has been arrested 3 times, which is quite concerning. Each arrest indicates a certain level of involvement with law enforcement and possibly a pattern of behavior that warrants further investigation. This suggests a higher likelihood of future criminal activity.\n\nFinally, I'll look at the conviction history. The fact that he or she has been convicted once already indicates a clear willingness to engage in activities that result in legal consequences. Convictions are strong indicators of an individual's propensity for criminal behavior.\n\nLet me summarize these points:\n- Age: High risk due to youth.\n- Ethnicity: Moderate risk, as there's no direct correlation but cultural factors may play a role.\n- Arrest history: High risk due to multiple arrests.\n- Conviction: High risk due to prior conviction.\n\nGiven this analysis, I need to determine the overall confidence level. Considering all the factors, it seems reasonable to assign a high level of confidence in the prediction that this individual indicates a high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
