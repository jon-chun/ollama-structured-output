    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the risk factors provided for the individual in question. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n- The person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic.\n- She has been arrested once and has been convicted.\n\nLet me check the context of these details. A young female, especially within the first decade of life, might be at higher risk due to her age and gender. This factor alone could contribute to a high-risk profile. However, I need to consider other factors as well.\n\nNow, let's think about the conviction record. Being convicted of an offense indicates a history of law-breaking. This is a significant red flag and suggests that she might be prone to criminal behavior. But how does this compare across different ages and genders?\n\nWait a minute... Let me break it down further. The combination of her age, gender, and conviction raises the profile significantly. Her being Hispanic doesn't inherently increase or decrease the risk factor but adds another layer of complexity.\n\nLet's consider the impact of these factors together:\n- Young age: High risk potential\n- Female: Higher likelihood of certain types of offenses\n- Convicted: Clear history of law-breaking\n\nGiven this combination, it seems that the risk is quite high. However, I need to quantify this into a confidence score between 0 and 100.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the overall profile indicates a high-risk status for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
