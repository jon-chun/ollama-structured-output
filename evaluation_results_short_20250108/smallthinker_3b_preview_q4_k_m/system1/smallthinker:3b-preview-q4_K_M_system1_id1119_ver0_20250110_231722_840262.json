    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the given risk factors for determining if they indicate high risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individual. The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. This demographic information is important in understanding potential biases and social influences that could affect his behavior. However, by itself, it does not necessarily indicate high risk. So, let me move on to other factors.\n\nNext, I'll examine the fact that he has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted. This is a significant piece of information because being arrested multiple times suggests a pattern of potential criminal activity or involvement in law enforcement. The lack of conviction, however, might indicate various reasons such as plea deals, reduced charges, or other legal outcomes. \n\nLet me think about this carefully. Arrests without convictions can be due to various factors, including the severity of the charges, cooperation with authorities, or even the complexity of the cases. Given these possibilities, I need to consider how to weigh the significance of these arrests.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The frequency of arrests (6 times) is quite high and raises concerns about his propensity for criminal behavior. However, the lack of conviction complicates the assessment. It's possible that he may have received lighter sentences or plea deals in some cases, which could mean that his actual involvement in crime might be lower than what the number of arrests suggests.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors. The high frequency of arrests without convictions does suggest a potential pattern of criminal behavior. But the lack of conviction introduces uncertainty about the true extent of his involvement.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I need to make a decision based on this analysis. Given the high frequency of arrests and the uncertainty due to the lack of conviction, I will lean towards indicating high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
