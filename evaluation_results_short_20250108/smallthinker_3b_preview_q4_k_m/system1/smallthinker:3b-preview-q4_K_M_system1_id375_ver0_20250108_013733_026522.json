    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the risk factors provided and assess them against established standards for criminal behavior. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements of the situation:\n- The individual is a 21-year-old male identified as White.\n- He has been arrested three times and convicted.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate these factors within the context of risk assessment in criminal justice. Let me check the typical risk scoring system used by experts in this field.\n\nWait a minute... Being a male and White alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk. These are demographic factors that don't typically correlate with criminal behavior without other indicators. So, I need to focus on the arrest and conviction history.\n\nLet's consider the frequency of arrests and convictions:\n- Three arrests and convictions could be seen as significant, but it depends on the context and nature of these offenses.\n- If these incidents involve serious crimes or if there is a pattern indicating escalating criminal behavior, this would raise more red flags.\n\nNext, I'll think about the standard risk scoring system. Typically, repeated arrests and convictions are scored higher because they suggest a pattern of non-compliance with the law and potential instability in the community.\n\nNow, let me break down the confidence level:\n- Given the three arrests and convictions, it's reasonable to have moderate confidence that these factors contribute to a high-risk profile.\n- However, the reliability of these factors can vary based on other circumstances such as the severity of offenses, the recidivism rate among individuals with similar backgrounds, and the specific jurisdiction's risk assessment criteria.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe there is a significant likelihood that this individual poses a high risk to the community. The combination of repeated arrests and convictions suggests a pattern of criminal behavior that warrants heightened scrutiny.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
