    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate the given risk factors for determining a high-risk prediction. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided:\n- The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested once but has not been convicted.\n\nNow, let me consider each factor individually and how it might contribute to a high-risk prediction. Wait a minute... age alone doesn't seem significant enough to indicate a high risk without other factors. The arrest record is more concerning, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, it's less indicative of current criminal behavior. However, the fact that he has been arrested at all suggests some level of involvement in potentially criminal activities.\n\nLet me check my understanding of the criteria for a high-risk prediction. Typically, such predictions rely on a combination of factors including previous convictions, types of crimes committed, and patterns of criminal behavior. Given the limited information provided, I can't establish any clear pattern or history that would lead to a high risk assessment.\n\nNow, let me put this all together in my analysis:\n- The 22-year-old male identification is straightforward but doesn't contribute significantly to a high-risk prediction.\n- The arrest record, while concerning, lacks the context of conviction and specific types of crimes.\n\nGiven these considerations, I can confidently say that based on the provided information, there isn't enough evidence to conclude that this individual is at a high risk of reoffending. Therefore, my final assessment will be a low confidence level in the prediction of a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
