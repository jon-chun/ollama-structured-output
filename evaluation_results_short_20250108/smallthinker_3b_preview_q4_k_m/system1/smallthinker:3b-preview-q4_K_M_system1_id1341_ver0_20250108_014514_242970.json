    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the risk factors provided and apply my expertise in criminal justice risk assessment. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the age and ethnicity of the individual. The person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. This demographic profile alone does not provide enough insight into her risk level. However, it's important to note that these factors can sometimes be indicative of certain patterns or behaviors, but they are often neutral in terms of risk assessment.\n\nNext, the key factor here is the number of arrests and convictions. The person has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. This is a significant indicator of high risk. Let me think about this carefully. Each arrest and conviction suggests that the individual may be engaging in behavior that puts her at risk of further criminal activity or that she has a history of breaking the law.\n\nNow, let's consider how these arrests and convictions might impact the overall risk assessment. Given that she has been arrested multiple times and convicted, it indicates a pattern of behavior that is likely to continue. This suggests a high propensity for future criminal actions, which would classify her as a high-risk individual.\n\nWait a minute... Let me check my understanding of the scale again. The question asks for a JSON object with two keys: \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". The \"prediction\" should be either \"YES\" or \"NO\", indicating if the risk is high or low, and \"confidence\" should be a number between 0 and 100.\n\nGiven all of this, I can confidently say that the individual in question indicates a high risk. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a high level of confidence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
