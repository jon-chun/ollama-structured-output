    "raw_message_text": "To begin with, let's consider some factors related to the individual:\n\n- Age: The subject is a young adult (21 years old), which could be both a risk and protective factor. This is a neutral factor.\n  \n- Gender: Being male doesn't have any significant predictive power in this context. This is also considered neutral.\n\n- Race: As per some studies, the race of an individual can influence their recidivism rates. White individuals are often found to have lower recidivism rates compared to other races. In our case, it's a positive factor (low risk).\n\n- Arrest count: The subject has been arrested once and convicted. This could be considered as a medium risk factor.\n\nNow let's move on to the predictive power of these factors:\n\n1. Age: Neutral\n2. Gender: Neutral\n3. Race: Low risk\n4. Arrest count: Medium risk\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would assign 'low' risk for race and 'medium' risk for arrest count.\n  \nAlso considering that the predictive power depends on more complex statistical models, let's calculate a rough prediction.\n\nThe individual is predicted to have a low risk of rearrest/recidivism in the next three years with an estimated probability of 80%.\n\nHere is your JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"neutral\", \"Age: Neutral\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"neutral\", \"Gender: Neutral\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race: White (Low risk)\"),\n    (\"arrest_count\", \"medium\", \"Arrest count: Once convicted (Medium risk)\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
