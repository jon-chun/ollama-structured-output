    "raw_message_text": "To accurately assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual, I would consider several factors. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\nStep 1: Age - The person is 22 years old. This is considered to be low-risk as young people are less likely to engage in criminal activities compared to older individuals.\n\nStep 2: Ethnicity - He identifies himself as White. This factor has not been found to significantly impact rearrest recidivism rates, so I'll assign a medium weight.\n\nStep 3: Arrest history - He has been arrested once. This could indicate a higher risk of rearrest, but since he's only been convicted once, it might be an isolated incident or a minor offense. Thus, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nStep 4: Conviction - He has been convicted once. This can increase the risk of rearrest, especially if the conviction was for a serious crime. However, without information on the nature of the crime, it's hard to determine how much impact this will have, so I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let me calculate the total risk score:\n\nRisk factors:\n- Age (low): 1 point\n- Ethnicity (medium): 2 points\n- Arrest history (low): 3 points\n- Conviction (medium): 4 points\n\nTotal: 10 points\n\nSince we have no additional data to consider, I'll assign a default prediction of \"NO\" for rearrest recidivism over the next three years. \n\nGiven that this is only an initial assessment and may be influenced by other factors not accounted for in our analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young people are less likely to engage in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Race has a minimal impact on rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest could be an isolated incident.\"),\n    (\"Conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction can increase the risk of rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
