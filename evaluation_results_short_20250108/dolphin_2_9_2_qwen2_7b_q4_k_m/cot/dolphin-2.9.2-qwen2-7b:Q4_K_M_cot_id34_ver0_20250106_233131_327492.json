In this case, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Asian / Pacific Islander. He has been arrested twice and convicted.\n\nRisk Factor Analysis:\n1. Age: 18 years old - Low Risk (This age group usually has lower recidivism rates)\n2. Ethnicity: Asian / Pacific Islander - Medium Risk (Asian males have a higher likelihood of being rearrested compared to the general population)\n3. Arrests: 2 times - High Risk (Multiple arrests increase an individual's risk of rearrest)\n4. Convictions: Yes - High Risk (Previous convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal behavior)\n\nConsidering these factors, our prediction for this person's likelihood of rearrest recidivism within the next three years would be:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18-year-old males have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Asian males have a higher likelihood of being rearrested compared to general population\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests increase an individual's risk of rearrest\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Previous convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
