The confidence level is set at 70%, indicating a moderate degree of certainty in this assessment. It's important to note that age and race alone are insufficient predictors of criminal behavior, and without any prior convictions or patterns of repeated offenses, it would be premature to categorize this individual as high-risk.\n\nHowever, the response acknowledges the potential for variance due to unknown factors not included in the provided data (e.g., specific nature of arrest, socio-economic background, family environment, etc.) that could alter the risk assessment. \n\nRemember, a comprehensive risk assessment typically involves more detailed information and analysis beyond basic demographic details and criminal history summaries.",
