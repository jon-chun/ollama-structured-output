However, having only one arrest without a conviction does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nThe absence of convictions is significant because it suggests there may have been insufficient evidence or circumstances were not as severe as initially thought during the arrest. Additionally, race should never be used as an independent predictor of criminal behavior due to ethical considerations and potential biases in the criminal justice system.\n\nTherefore, with only one arrest without conviction, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk, but confidence is set at 70% because there could be other contextual factors (e.g., nature of the offense, prior encounters with law enforcement that did not lead to arrests) not provided here. It's important to continually reassess individuals based on new data and to use multiple sources of information when conducting risk assessments.",
