The confidence level is set at 75%, reflecting moderate certainty in this prediction.\n\nIt's important to note that arrest history alone is not necessarily predictive of future criminal behavior, especially without convictions and considering her young age. Additionally, demographic characteristics such as race should not be used as predictors of risk, as they are non-behavioral factors that can lead to bias and discrimination in risk assessment practices.\n\nThe prediction takes into account the lack of conviction records, implying that she may have been arrested but was either not charged or charges were dismissed. Furthermore, youth is often associated with greater malleability and opportunities for intervention and support rather than increased risk.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to conduct a more comprehensive analysis that includes other behavioral and contextual factors (e.g., family environment, community ties, educational background, mental health status) to make a robust risk assessment. The current response relies solely on the provided data points and standard criminal justice risk assessment principles.",
