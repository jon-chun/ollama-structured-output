    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nHere's the reasoning behind this response:\n\n1. **Age:** While younger individuals may be statistically more likely to engage in criminal behavior, a 20-year-old is on the cusp of early adulthood where risk-taking behavior typically decreases.\n\n2. **Gender and Race:** Being male increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity compared to females, but race (identifying as Black) does not inherently indicate an increased risk for future criminal activities. It's crucial to avoid assumptions based on racial identification due to concerns about systemic bias and discrimination.\n\n3. **Arrest History:** Two arrests without convictions suggest that either charges were dropped or the individual was found not guilty. While it indicates some level of involvement with law enforcement, the lack of conviction means there is no legal determination of guilt, which lowers risk perception.\n\n4. **Conviction Status:** The absence of any convictions significantly reduces the perceived risk since this person has not been legally held responsible for a criminal act.\n\nGiven these factors and avoiding biases associated with race, I predict that the individual does not present a high risk, but there is some uncertainty due to limited information about the nature of arrests or underlying behaviors. Therefore, a confidence level of 70% reflects a cautious stance without over-reliance on incomplete data.",
