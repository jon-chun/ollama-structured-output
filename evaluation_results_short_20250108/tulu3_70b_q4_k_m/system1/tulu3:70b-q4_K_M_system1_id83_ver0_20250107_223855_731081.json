However, being only 19 years old also means there's ample opportunity for growth and change.\n  \n- **Gender**: Statistically speaking, females tend to have lower rates of recidivism compared to males.\n\n- **Race**: The person identifies as Black. Race alone is not a predictor of criminal behavior or risk; however, systemic biases in the justice system might increase scrutiny on individuals from minority groups.\n\n- **Arrest History**: Having only one arrest with no convictions suggests that this individual's encounter with law enforcement may have been isolated and perhaps even unjustified or minor in nature. Without conviction, there is less evidence of criminal behavior.\n\nThe confidence level is 75 because while the risk factors do not strongly indicate high risk based on statistical generalizations (age and gender), the lack of convictions and only one arrest suggest a low likelihood for re-offense without additional specific individual behavioral indicators or context.",
