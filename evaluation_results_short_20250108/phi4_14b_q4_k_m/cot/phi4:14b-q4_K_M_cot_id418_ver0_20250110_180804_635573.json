    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism, we need to evaluate various risk factors associated with criminal behavior. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and lack of life experience.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Individuals in their early 20s are statistically more likely to reoffend compared to older age groups.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Males are overrepresented in criminal statistics, indicating a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\n3. **Ethnicity (Asian / Pacific Islander)**: This group typically has lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Research indicates that Asian/Pacific Islanders have lower involvement in criminal activities and subsequent arrests.\n\n4. **Previous Arrests**: Having been arrested previously, even without a conviction, can be indicative of potential future risk.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Prior arrest history is often correlated with higher recidivism rates, although the lack of conviction may mitigate this slightly.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Not having a prior conviction might reduce the likelihood of reoffending compared to those with convictions.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: The absence of a criminal record suggests less entrenched criminal behavior.\n\nBased on these factors, we can predict the likelihood of rearrest recidivism:\n\n- Age and gender are significant risk factors suggesting higher risk.\n- Ethnicity provides some protective effect against high recidivism.\n- Previous arrest is a concern but mitigated by lack of conviction.\n\nConsidering these weights collectively, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for potential rearrest within three years, but with moderate confidence due to mixed indicators.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Individuals in their early 20s are statistically more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islanders typically have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Prior arrest history is correlated with higher recidivism, though no conviction reduces this risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"low\", \"Lack of prior convictions suggests less entrenched criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
