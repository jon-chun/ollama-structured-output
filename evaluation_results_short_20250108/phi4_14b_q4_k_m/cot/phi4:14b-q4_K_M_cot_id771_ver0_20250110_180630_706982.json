    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we will evaluate various relevant factors using established research in criminal justice risk assessment. These include age, gender, ethnicity, prior arrests, and convictions.\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is 22 years old. Younger individuals are generally considered at higher risk due to impulsivity, peer influence, and less life stability. \n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Statistical data shows younger offenders have a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to older age groups.\n\n2. **Gender**: The individual is male. Males typically have higher rates of recidivism than females.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Gender plays a significant role in predicting recidivism, with males being at greater risk than females.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: The individual identifies as Hispanic. Ethnicity can influence risk due to socio-economic factors and potential systemic biases.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: While ethnicity itself is not a direct predictor of criminal behavior, it may correlate with other risk factors like economic disadvantage or discrimination.\n\n4. **Prior Arrests**: The individual has been arrested 3 times. A history of arrests indicates prior interactions with the justice system and possible habitual offending.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Prior arrests are a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, as they indicate previous engagement in illegal activities.\n\n5. **Convictions**: The individual has at least one conviction, indicating successful legal processing of past offenses.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Convictions are serious indicators of risk since they reflect proven guilt and established patterns of offending behavior.\n\nBased on these weighted factors, the collective assessment suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism within 3 years:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals tend to have higher rates of recidivism due to impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally show higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity may correlate with socio-economic factors influencing risk but is not a direct predictor.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"A history of arrests indicates prior criminal behavior and increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"medium\", \"Convictions are strong indicators of past proven offenses, suggesting potential for future recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n``` \n\nThis assessment results in a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 75%, reflecting the high risk associated with age, prior arrests, and gender.",
