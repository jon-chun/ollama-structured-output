    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we will analyze several key risk factors. Each factor is assigned a weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism, supported by textual reasoning.\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals are generally at higher risk of reoffending. At 22, the person falls into an age category associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Statistical data shows that younger offenders have a higher likelihood of rearrest due to factors such as impulsivity and social influences.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males are statistically more likely to be rearrested compared to females.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Gender plays a significant role, with males having a higher propensity for criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: While race itself is not a direct predictor of individual behavior, systemic issues may affect recidivism rates among Black individuals due to disparities in the criminal justice system.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Racial disparities can influence outcomes such as access to rehabilitation and support services.\n\n4. **Number of Prior Arrests**: A higher number of prior arrests is a strong predictor of future offending behavior.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: The individual's history of 7 arrests indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\n5. **Convictions**: Having previous convictions further solidifies the risk of reoffending.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Convictions reflect confirmed instances of criminal activity, suggesting a higher risk of future offenses.\n\nBased on these factors, we can predict the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- The combination of age, gender, number of prior arrests, and convictions suggests a high risk of reoffending.\n- Systemic issues related to race may also contribute to this assessment.\n\nGiven the analysis, the prediction is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and social influences.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males are statistically more likely to be rearrested compared to females.\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues may affect recidivism rates among Black individuals.\"),\n    (\"number_of_prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"A higher number of prior arrests is a strong predictor of future offending behavior.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Previous convictions suggest a confirmed pattern of criminal activity.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
