    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we need to evaluate several key factors based on empirical research in criminal justice. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals generally have higher recidivism rates due to lack of maturity and life experience. A 19-year-old would typically be considered at higher risk.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, which might suggest a lower relative weight for this factor.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Black individuals often face systemic biases that can affect arrest and conviction rates. However, research shows mixed results regarding racial differences in recidivism once controlling for other factors.\n\n4. **Prior Arrests**: Multiple arrests without convictions still indicate patterns of behavior that could lead to future offenses. This factor is significant as it reflects a history of interactions with the criminal justice system.\n\n5. **Convictions**: No prior convictions may suggest lower risk compared to those with convictions, but repeated arrests can still be indicative of ongoing problematic behaviors.\n\n6. **Other Factors**: Consideration of socio-economic status, education level, employment status, and social support systems could also influence recidivism risk, though these are not specified here.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Age: High - Young age is a significant predictor of higher recidivism.\n- Gender: Low - Female gender typically correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n- Race/Ethnicity: Medium - Systemic factors may play a role but do not solely determine risk.\n- Prior Arrests: High - Multiple arrests suggest ongoing risky behavior.\n- Convictions: Medium - Lack of convictions is positive, but repeated arrests are concerning.\n\nCollectively, these factors suggest a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years. The prediction leans towards \"YES\" for potential recidivism, with a confidence level reflecting the uncertainty inherent in such assessments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Systemic biases may affect outcomes, but results are mixed regarding racial differences in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to future offenses.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"medium\", \"No prior convictions are positive, but repeated arrests are concerning.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
