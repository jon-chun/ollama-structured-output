    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we need to consider several key factors and assign relative weights based on statistical data and research in criminal justice. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: At 20 years old, she falls into a higher-risk category for recidivism compared to older individuals. Younger offenders often have less established social ties and responsibilities that might deter reoffending.\n\n2. **Gender**: Female offenders generally have lower rates of recidivism compared to males. This is an important factor in reducing the overall risk assessment.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: While race itself should not be a direct predictor, statistical data often show disparities in outcomes for Black individuals due to systemic issues. However, this should be considered cautiously and contextually.\n\n4. **Number of Prior Arrests**: Having been arrested once suggests some criminal history, but it's relatively low compared to those with multiple arrests or convictions, which typically indicate higher recidivism risk.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: A prior conviction is a significant factor as it indicates past involvement in the criminal justice system and potential for reoffending.\n\n6. **Socioeconomic Factors**: While not explicitly mentioned, socioeconomic status often plays a role in recidivism rates. However, without specific information, we cannot assign a weight here.\n\n7. **Support Systems**: The presence or absence of strong social support systems (family, community) can influence recidivism risk. Again, this is not detailed in the scenario.\n\n8. **Substance Abuse/Dependency**: If present, substance abuse issues are strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates. This factor is not mentioned here.\n\n9. **Employment/Education Status**: Employment and educational attainment are protective factors against recidivism. Lack of information on this aspect means it cannot be weighted.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we assign weights as follows:\n\n- Age: High (Younger individuals have higher risk)\n- Gender: Low (Females generally have lower recidivism rates)\n- Race/Ethnicity: Medium (Consider systemic issues but cautious use)\n- Number of Prior Arrests: Medium (One arrest is notable but not high)\n- Conviction Status: High (Prior conviction indicates risk)\n\nNow, we synthesize these factors to predict the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals generally have higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically exhibit lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Statistical data show disparities, but caution is needed in direct application.\"),\n    (\"number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest indicates some history but not high risk.\"),\n    (\"conviction status\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" for potential rearrest within three years, with a confidence level of 65%, reflecting the significant influence of age and prior conviction balanced against lower gender-related risks.",
