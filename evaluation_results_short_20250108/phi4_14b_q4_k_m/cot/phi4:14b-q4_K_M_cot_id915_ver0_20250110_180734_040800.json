    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we need to consider several risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals often have a higher likelihood of reoffending due to impulsivity and lack of life experience. However, being 21 years old is on the cusp of adulthood, so the risk may not be as high as it would be for someone in their teens.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males, which could suggest a lower risk factor here.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: While race itself is not a predictor of criminal behavior, systemic biases and socioeconomic factors associated with being Black may contribute to higher risks in some contexts. However, this should be considered cautiously and within the context of broader social factors rather than as an inherent risk.\n\n4. **Prior Arrests**: Having been arrested once without a conviction suggests some interaction with the justice system but does not necessarily indicate high recidivism risk, especially without further context on the nature or circumstances of the arrest.\n\n5. **Conviction History**: No convictions imply that there is no established pattern of criminal behavior leading to legal penalties, which generally lowers the perceived risk.\n\n6. **Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors**: These are not provided in the scenario but can significantly impact recidivism risk. Without this information, we must proceed with caution.\n\nBased on these factors, here's a structured assessment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Being 21 years old places the individual at an age where there is potential for higher impulsivity and involvement in risky behaviors, but not as high as younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males, suggesting a lower risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"While race itself is not predictive of behavior, systemic factors associated with being Black may contribute to higher risks in some contexts.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited interaction with the justice system and does not strongly indicate high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"low\", \"No convictions suggest no established pattern of criminal behavior leading to legal penalties, lowering perceived risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the available data and typical trends observed in recidivism studies. The confidence level reflects the limited information provided and the inherent uncertainties in predicting individual behavior.",
