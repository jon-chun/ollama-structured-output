    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we will consider several key risk factors. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: At 19 years old, the individual falls into an age category often associated with higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and developmental factors. \n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Young adults are statistically more likely to reoffend compared to older individuals.\n\n2. **Gender**: Being male is a factor that has been linked to higher recidivism rates in criminal justice research.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Males generally have higher rearrest rates than females, but this is less predictive than age.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: Identifying as Hispanic can be relevant due to potential systemic biases and socioeconomic factors that may influence recidivism.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: While ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor, it can intersect with other risk factors such as economic disadvantage.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: Having been arrested 6 times indicates a pattern of involvement with the criminal justice system, even without convictions.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Frequent arrests suggest ongoing risky behavior or associations that could lead to rearrest.\n\n5. **Conviction History**: No prior convictions might suggest either a lack of exposure to the penal system's deterrent effects or simply luck/lack of evidence in past cases.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Lack of convictions can mean less deterrence but also fewer opportunities for intervention.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction:\n\n- The high weight given to age and number of arrests suggests a significant risk of rearrest.\n- Gender adds moderate risk, while ethnicity contributes minimally.\n- No prior convictions provide some uncertainty but do not significantly reduce the overall risk given the other factors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is \"YES,\" with a high degree of confidence due to the strong influence of age and arrest history.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are statistically more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher rearrest rates than females.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor, but can intersect with other factors.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Frequent arrests suggest ongoing risky behavior or associations.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Lack of convictions means less deterrence but also fewer opportunities for intervention.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
