    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual, we need to consider various risk factors commonly used in criminal justice settings. These factors often include age, gender, race, prior arrest history, and conviction history among others. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age (22 years old):**\n   - Younger individuals are generally at higher risk of recidivism due to less stability in life circumstances.\n   - **Weight:** Medium\n   - **Reasoning:** Age is a significant factor, but being 22 is not as high-risk as younger ages.\n\n2. **Gender (Female):**\n   - Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n   - **Weight:** Low\n   - **Reasoning:** Gender suggests a lower risk of reoffending compared to males.\n\n3. **Race (White):**\n   - Studies show that race alone is not a strong predictor, but systemic factors can influence outcomes.\n   - **Weight:** Low\n   - **Reasoning:** Race itself does not significantly impact recidivism rates in this context.\n\n4. **Prior Arrests (2 times):**\n   - Multiple prior arrests indicate a pattern of behavior and higher risk.\n   - **Weight:** Medium\n   - **Reasoning:** While not extremely high, multiple arrests suggest some level of ongoing involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\n5. **Convictions:**\n   - Having been convicted indicates past criminal behavior but also suggests exposure to interventions like probation or parole.\n   - **Weight:** Medium\n   - **Reasoning:** Conviction history is a significant factor, as it reflects confirmed engagement in criminal activity.\n\n6. **Other Considerations (e.g., socioeconomic status, education, employment):**\n   - Without specific data on these factors, they are not directly weighted but can influence outcomes.\n   - **Weight:** Not applicable\n   - **Reasoning:** These factors could modify risk but lack specific information here.\n\n**Collective Analysis:**\n- The combination of age, prior arrests, and convictions suggests a moderate risk level. Gender and race do not significantly increase the risk in this scenario.\n\n**Prediction:**\n- Given the medium weights on several key factors, there is a reasonable likelihood of recidivism within three years.\n- **Confidence:** 65 (reflecting moderate certainty based on available data)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger age generally indicates higher risk due to less life stability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Multiple prior arrests indicate a pattern and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"medium\", \"Conviction history reflects confirmed criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
