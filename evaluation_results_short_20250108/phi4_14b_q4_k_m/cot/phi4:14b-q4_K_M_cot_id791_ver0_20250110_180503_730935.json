    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 21-year-old female who identifies as White, with two arrests and one conviction, we must consider various factors. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and lack of life experience.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Age 21 falls within the range where criminal behavior peaks.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Gender is a protective factor in this context.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: Being White does not statistically increase or decrease risk significantly compared to other ethnic groups, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Ethnicity can interact with systemic factors but is less predictive without additional context.\n\n4. **Number of Prior Arrests**: Having multiple arrests indicates a pattern of criminal behavior.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Two prior arrests suggest an ongoing issue with law compliance.\n\n5. **Conviction History**: A conviction history increases the likelihood of future offenses due to established patterns of behavior and potential systemic challenges post-conviction.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: A conviction is a strong indicator of risk for recidivism.\n\n6. **Time Since Last Arrest/Conviction**: Not specified, but time since last arrest can influence recidivism rates; shorter periods may indicate higher risk.\n   - Weight: Medium (Assuming recent)\n   - Reasoning: Without specific timing, we assume it is relatively recent due to age and prior arrests.\n\n7. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Not provided, but these are significant in predicting recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Lack of information implies potential for unaddressed socioeconomic issues.\n\n8. **Substance Abuse/Dependency**: Not mentioned, but often a critical factor in recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium (Assuming absence)\n   - Reasoning: Absence of data suggests no known issues, but it is a common risk factor.\n\n9. **Support System**: Not specified, but important for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Lack of information implies potential lack of support.\n\n10. **Employment/Education Status**: Not provided, but these factors are crucial in predicting future behavior.\n    - Weight: Medium\n    - Reasoning: Absence of data suggests potential challenges in these areas.\n\n**Prediction Analysis**:\n- The combination of young age, multiple arrests, and a conviction suggests a higher risk of recidivism.\n- Protective factors like gender may mitigate some risk but not sufficiently to outweigh the high-risk indicators present.\n\n**Final Prediction**: Given the weighted analysis, the likelihood of 3-year rearrest is \"YES.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Age 21 falls within the range where criminal behavior peaks.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Ethnicity can interact with systemic factors but is less predictive without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests suggest an ongoing issue with law compliance.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"A conviction is a strong indicator of risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Time Since Last Arrest/Conviction\", \"medium\", \"Assuming recent, which indicates higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Socioeconomic Factors\", \"medium\", \"Lack of information implies potential for unaddressed socioeconomic issues.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse/Dependency\", \"medium\", \"Absence of data suggests no known issues, but it is a common risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Support System\", \"medium\", \"Lack of information implies potential lack of support.\"),\n    (\"Employment/Education Status\", \"medium\", \"Absence of data suggests potential challenges in these areas.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
