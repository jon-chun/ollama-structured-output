    "raw_message_text": "To assess the relative weight of each risk factor for predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism, we will consider several commonly evaluated factors in criminal justice risk assessments. Each factor will be weighed based on empirical research and statistical analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: \n   - At 21 years old, the individual is in a transitional age group where recidivism rates tend to decrease as individuals move into their late twenties.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: Young adults have higher recidivism rates than older adults but are generally lower than teenagers.\n\n2. **Gender**:\n   - Males typically have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\n   - **Weight**: High\n   - **Reasoning**: Statistically, males have been shown to have a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**:\n   - While race/ethnicity can correlate with socioeconomic factors that influence recidivism, it is not used as a direct risk factor due to ethical and legal considerations.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: Race alone does not predict recidivism; socioeconomic context might be more relevant.\n\n4. **Number of Prior Arrests**:\n   - Having multiple prior arrests can indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, but one arrest suggests limited previous involvement with the justice system.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: A single prior arrest indicates some risk but not as high as multiple arrests would.\n\n5. **Number of Prior Convictions**:\n   - Having at least one conviction can be a significant indicator of recidivism, especially if recent.\n   - **Weight**: High\n   - **Reasoning**: A past conviction is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\n\n6. **Age at First Arrest**:\n   - Early onset of criminal behavior is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   - **Assumption**: Assuming this was the first arrest, it suggests no early onset.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: No evidence of early onset reduces risk.\n\n### Prediction:\n\nBased on the weighted factors, we can predict the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism. The presence of a conviction and male gender are significant predictors, while age and limited prior arrests mitigate some risk.\n\n- **Prediction**: YES (The individual is predicted to have a moderate to high chance of recidivism based on the factors analyzed.)\n- **Confidence**: 65 (Given the mixed indicators, there is moderate confidence in this prediction.)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have higher recidivism rates than older adults but are generally lower than teenagers.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males typically have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not predict recidivism; socioeconomic context might be more relevant.\"),\n    (\"number_of_prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest indicates some risk but not as high as multiple arrests would.\"),\n    (\"number_of_prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"A past conviction is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"low\", \"No evidence of early onset reduces risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
