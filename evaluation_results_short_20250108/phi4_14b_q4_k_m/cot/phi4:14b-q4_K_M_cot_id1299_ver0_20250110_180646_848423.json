    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for an 18-year-old female with Hispanic identity who has been arrested three times and convicted, we need to consider several key factors:\n\n1. **Age at First Arrest**: Younger age at first arrest is often associated with a higher likelihood of continued criminal activity.\n   - **Weight**: High\n   - **Reasoning**: Being 18 suggests that her criminal behavior started at an early age, which can increase recidivism risk.\n\n2. **Gender**: Research indicates that females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: Her gender may provide a protective factor against high recidivism.\n\n3. **Ethnicity/National Origin (Hispanic)**: Studies show varying results, but some data suggest Hispanic individuals might face higher recidivism risks due to socioeconomic factors.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: Ethnic background can interact with other social and economic variables influencing risk.\n\n4. **Number of Prior Arrests**: A history of multiple arrests is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\n   - **Weight**: High\n   - **Reasoning**: Having been arrested three times indicates a pattern of repeated encounters with the law, increasing recidivism likelihood.\n\n5. **Convictions**: Previous convictions are a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n   - **Weight**: High\n   - **Reasoning**: The presence of convictions shows not only arrests but also legal adjudication of guilt, which strongly correlates with future offenses.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively:\n\n- The combination of young age at first arrest and multiple prior arrests/convictions points towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n- Gender may mitigate this risk slightly, while ethnic background adds complexity without being determinative on its own.\n\nGiven the high weight assigned to age-related factors and conviction history, the overall prediction leans toward a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. However, confidence in this prediction is moderated by her gender and other social support mechanisms that might be present but are not detailed here.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age at First Arrest\", \"high\", \"Being 18 suggests early onset of criminal behavior, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity/National Origin (Hispanic)\", \"medium\", \"Socioeconomic factors associated with ethnicity may influence risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of repeated criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Previous convictions strongly correlate with future offenses.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
