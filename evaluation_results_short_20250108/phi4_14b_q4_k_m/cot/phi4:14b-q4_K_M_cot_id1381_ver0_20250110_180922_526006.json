    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of recidivism, we need to evaluate several factors based on empirical research in criminal justice. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger offenders tend to have higher rates of recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life experience.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: The individual is 20 years old, which falls within the age range associated with increased risk.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Being male contributes to a moderate increase in recidivism risk.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: Hispanic individuals may face systemic challenges that can affect recidivism, though this is often mediated by other factors like socioeconomic status.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Ethnicity alone has a relatively low impact compared to other individual-level factors.\n\n4. **Criminal History (Arrests)**: Prior arrests are indicative of previous involvement in criminal activity.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Two prior arrests suggest a pattern but not as strong an indicator as convictions.\n\n5. **Convictions**: Previous convictions are a stronger predictor of recidivism than mere arrests.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: The individual has been convicted, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n6. **Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors**: These can include employment status, education level, and community support, but we lack specific data here.\n   - Weight: Not assessable due to insufficient data\n\nCombining these factors:\n\n- High-risk factors (Age, Convictions) suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n- Medium-risk factors (Gender, Arrests) contribute moderately.\n- Low-risk factor (Ethnicity) has minimal impact.\n\nBased on the weight and prevalence of high and medium risk factors, the prediction leans towards recidivism within three years. However, without complete data on socioeconomic conditions or interventions, there is some uncertainty.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 20 years old, an age associated with higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Being male contributes to a moderate increase in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone has a relatively low impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests suggest a pattern of criminal behavior but are less predictive than convictions.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
