    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism, we will consider several key factors:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to less stability in life circumstances.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: At 21 years old, this individual is within the age range associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males have statistically higher recidivism rates compared to females.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: The male gender is a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: While race can influence risk due to systemic factors, it should be considered with caution and context.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Being White does not inherently increase or decrease the risk of recidivism without additional contextual factors.\n\n4. **Prior Arrests**: Prior arrests are indicative of previous encounters with law enforcement but do not equate to convictions.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Two prior arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future offenses, although no convictions were recorded.\n\n5. **Convictions**: The absence of prior convictions suggests lower risk compared to those with criminal records.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: No convictions imply fewer legal repercussions and potentially less involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively:\n\n- Age (High) and Gender (Medium) suggest a higher baseline risk.\n- Prior Arrests (Medium) indicate some behavioral patterns that could lead to recidivism.\n- Race/Ethnicity (Low) and Convictions (Low) do not significantly alter the overall risk assessment in this context.\n\nGiven these considerations, the prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. However, the absence of convictions provides some mitigating context.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At 21 years old, this individual is within the age range associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"The male gender is a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being White does not inherently increase or decrease the risk of recidivism without additional contextual factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future offenses, although no convictions were recorded.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"low\", \"No convictions imply fewer legal repercussions and potentially less involvement in the criminal justice system.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
