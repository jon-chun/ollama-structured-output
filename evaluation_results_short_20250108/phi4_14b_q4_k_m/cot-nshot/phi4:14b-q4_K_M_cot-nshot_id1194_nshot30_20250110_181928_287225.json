However, since the individual has no convictions, it suggests a lower risk for recidivism.\n\n4. **Arrest History:** A single arrest without subsequent convictions does not strongly predict rearrest according to multiple examples in this dataset, thus given low weight.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** This factor carries high weight because individuals who have not been convicted show a consistently lower likelihood of rearrest, indicating it's a strong predictor when absent.\n\nGiven these weighted factors and the pattern observed from similar examples in the data set, we predict \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 75%. This reflects the consistency seen in cases without convictions leading to no subsequent rearrests.",
