Age alone does not strongly correlate with outcome.\"),\n    (\"gender_male\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher rearrest rates compared to females in the dataset. Being male increases risk relative to being female.\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"White individuals show a wide range of outcomes, but there is no consistent high recidivism pattern based on race alone.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_3\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested multiple times (3 in this case) correlates with higher likelihood of recidivism, as seen in several examples where 3 or more arrests result in a YES outcome.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"Convictions strongly correlate with recidivism.

Multiple arrests correlate with higher chances of rearrest within three years, as seen in multiple examples where similar numbers led to YES outcomes.\n\n- **Conviction**: Convictions are assigned a high weight because having been convicted is strongly associated with recidivism, aligning with most cases resulting in a YES outcome after conviction.\n\nThe combination of being arrested 3 times and having at least one conviction leads to the prediction of \"YES\" for the likelihood of rearrest within three years. The confidence level is set at 75 due to strong indicators (number of arrests and convictions) but acknowledging variability in similar cases.",
