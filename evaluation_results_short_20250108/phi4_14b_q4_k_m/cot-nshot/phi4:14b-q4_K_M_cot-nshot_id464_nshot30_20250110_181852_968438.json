Therefore, the weight assigned is low.\n\n2. **Gender:** Male gender appears to be associated with more frequent positive outcomes of recidivism (\"YES\"), leading to a medium risk assessment for this factor.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity:** In the examples provided, being White does not strongly correlate with higher recidivism rates compared to other races/ethnicities. This results in a low weight for race/ethnicity as a risk factor.\n\n4. **Arrest Count:** Being arrested once is common among those who do not reoffend (\"NO\"), suggesting that this alone is not a strong predictor of future arrest, thus it receives a low weight.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** Not having been convicted seems to correlate with lower recidivism rates in the data, leading to a medium weight for this factor as non-conviction tends to indicate a lower likelihood of reoffending.\n\nThe prediction is \"NO\" because the combination of these weighted factors suggests a lower risk of recidivism. The confidence level is set at 75% due to the mixed nature of outcomes associated with similar profiles in the dataset, but overall trends supporting the decision.",
