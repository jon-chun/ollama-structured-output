While there are some patterns, they do not strongly indicate increased risk for this specific age group (21-year-olds).\n  \n- **Gender**: Gender seems to have a minimal impact on outcomes in these examples, as both males and females across various ages had YES and NO outcomes.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Being White generally correlates with a lower likelihood of recidivism (NO outcome) based on the dataset. However, some exceptions exist, making it a medium risk factor rather than low or high.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: A single arrest does not strongly correlate with recidivism in this dataset. Many individuals with one or multiple arrests had NO outcomes.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Not having been convicted tends to be associated with lower recidivism rates, as evidenced by several examples where non-convicted individuals resulted in a NO outcome.\n\nGiven these assessments, the prediction for a 21-year-old female who is White and has been arrested once but not convicted is that she will likely have no recidivism within three years (NO). The confidence level of 85 reflects the strong pattern seen with similar profiles resulting in NO outcomes.",
