However, the data shows mixed outcomes for this age group, leading to a medium weight.\n\n- **Gender:** Males are generally more likely to reoffend than females, but in these examples, gender alone does not strongly determine the outcome, so it is assigned a low weight.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** The individual's race (Black) shows some variability in outcomes. Some Black individuals have high recidivism rates, while others do not, leading to a medium weight for this factor.\n\n- **Number of Arrests:** Being arrested three times significantly increases the risk of recidivism, as seen in several examples where multiple arrests correlate with a 'YES' outcome. This is assigned a high weight.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Conviction is a critical factor, often correlating with higher recidivism rates. The individual's conviction status contributes heavily to predicting a 'YES' outcome, thus receiving a high weight.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for recidivism is based on the combination of having multiple arrests and a conviction, which are strong indicators in this dataset. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the clear patterns observed with these specific risk factors, though some variability exists within similar cases.",
