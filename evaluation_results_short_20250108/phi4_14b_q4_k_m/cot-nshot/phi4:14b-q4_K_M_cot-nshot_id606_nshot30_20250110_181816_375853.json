Race alone does not provide a strong predictive value without other factors.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: Two arrests is moderate but still notable; in the dataset, those with more than one arrest generally show higher recidivism rates, especially if combined with convictions.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Having at least one conviction strongly correlates with higher likelihood of rearrest, as seen in numerous examples where individuals with past convictions have re-offended.\n\n**Prediction Confidence**: The confidence level is set at 75 due to the combination of high risk from having a prior conviction and multiple arrests, despite some variability observed in similar cases. The factors collectively suggest an increased risk for recidivism, leading to a prediction of \"YES\". However, there remains uncertainty due to individual variations seen across different examples.",
