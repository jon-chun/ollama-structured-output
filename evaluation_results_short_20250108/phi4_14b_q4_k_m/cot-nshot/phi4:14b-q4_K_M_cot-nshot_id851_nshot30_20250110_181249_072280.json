Thus, age is not a strong standalone predictor.\n  \n- **Gender (Male):** Males tend to have higher rates of recidivism compared to females across most examples, suggesting gender plays a medium role.\n\n- **Race (Black):** The outcomes for Black individuals are mixed; however, there are more cases where Black individuals with risk factors such as multiple arrests or convictions end up rearrested. Thus, race is considered a medium risk factor.\n\n- **Arrest Count (2):** An arrest count of 2, particularly when coupled with conviction, indicates a moderate increase in recidivism risk, as seen in Example #16 where an 18-year-old Black male was rearrested.\n\n- **Conviction Status (Convicted):** Conviction is the strongest predictor among the factors, as nearly all individuals who were convicted and had other risk factors also experienced recidivism.\n\nThe prediction leans towards \"YES\" due to the high weight of conviction status combined with medium weights for gender, race, and arrest count. The confidence level reflects the strength of these predictors based on patterns observed in the examples provided.",
