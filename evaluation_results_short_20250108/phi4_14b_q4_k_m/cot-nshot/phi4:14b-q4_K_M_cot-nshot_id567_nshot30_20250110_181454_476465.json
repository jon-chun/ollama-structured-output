However, the data shows mixed outcomes for individuals around this age, thus assigning a medium weight.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males tend to have slightly higher recidivism rates based on the examples provided, but there are exceptions. Thus, gender is assigned a medium weight as it can be influential but isn't determinative alone.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: The data does not show consistent patterns regarding ethnicity leading to high or low outcomes in this dataset, suggesting that ethnicity has a lower impact on recidivism predictions for this case, hence the low weight.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: With only one arrest recorded and no conviction, this factor typically suggests a lower risk of recidivism based on the examples provided, leading to a low weighting.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Not having been convicted is generally positive in terms of reducing perceived risk, but it doesn't entirely eliminate future risks. Thus, we assign a medium weight here as non-conviction can indicate lesser engagement with criminal activity but not a guarantee against it.\n\n### Prediction and Confidence:\nBased on the weighted analysis of these factors, the prediction for this case is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism. The confidence level is set at 75 due to moderate certainty in the patterns observed, although there are exceptions that could affect outcomes differently.",
