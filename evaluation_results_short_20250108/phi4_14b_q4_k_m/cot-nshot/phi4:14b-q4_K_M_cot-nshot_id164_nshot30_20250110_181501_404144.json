It doesn\u2019t heavily influence the decision, thus given a low weight.\n  \n- **Gender**: Males are more frequently rearrested within three years compared to females in these examples, suggesting that gender plays a moderate role.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Outcomes for White individuals vary greatly; while there is some indication of bias based on race/ethnicity, it\u2019s not as strong a predictor here and thus has low weight.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: One arrest correlates with both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes. However, multiple arrests correlate more strongly with recidivism, so its influence is medium when combined with conviction status.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: This factor consistently shows a strong correlation with positive recidivism outcomes in the dataset, giving it high weight.\n\nGiven these weighted factors, the presence of only one arrest and a conviction for this individual leads to predicting \"NO\" recidivism within three years. The confidence level is set at 75 due to mixed signals from similar profiles but leaning toward no recidivism based on single-conviction cases in the examples provided.",
