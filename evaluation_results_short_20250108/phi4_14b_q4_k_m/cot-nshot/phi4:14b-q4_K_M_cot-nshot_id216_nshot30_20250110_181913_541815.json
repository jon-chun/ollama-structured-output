Age is moderately influential.\n\n2. **Gender**: Gender does not consistently predict the outcome on its own, as both genders have shown varied outcomes depending on other factors.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Black individuals in these examples show mixed results, suggesting race/ethnicity alone isn't decisive but can influence risk when combined with other factors.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: With four arrests, she falls into a category where multiple arrests correlate with higher recidivism risk, especially when paired with convictions.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Conviction is a strong predictor of recidivism, as seen in many examples where conviction aligns with positive outcomes.\n\nGiven the combination of four arrests and a conviction, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for recidivism, though not with absolute certainty due to mixed results among similar profiles.
