This factor alone suggests a low risk.\n\n2. **Gender:** Being female is associated with lower rates of recidivism across the dataset. Most females, regardless of other factors like race or conviction status, tend to have 'NO' outcomes. Thus, this factor contributes minimally to predicting a high risk.\n\n3. **Race:** While being White does not guarantee a 'NO', there are multiple instances where White individuals with similar profiles (e.g., one arrest and no conviction) also resulted in 'NO'. However, race alone might interact differently when combined with other factors, hence assigned medium weight.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** With only one arrest, the pattern observed in the examples is a strong indicator towards lower recidivism risk ('NO'), since multiple arrests often correlate with higher risk outcomes.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** The absence of conviction significantly correlates with 'NO' outcomes across several profiles. In this dataset, those without convictions tend to have lower recidivism rates, making it a high-weight factor in predicting a low-risk outcome.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors, especially the lack of conviction and being female, strongly suggests that the predicted 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is 'NO'. The confidence level reflects the consistency observed in similar cases within the dataset.",
