Most 'YES' outcomes involved previously convicted individuals.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nBased on these weighted factors, the prediction for a 19-year-old male who identifies as White, arrested three times and convicted, is \"YES\" for a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome with moderate confidence (75%). This decision considers the high impact of multiple arrests and conviction history, despite some mitigating factors like race and age.",
