However, without a conviction, the risk seems lower.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: A single arrest is less indicative of future recidivism compared to multiple arrests.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Not having a prior conviction strongly correlates with lower recidivism rates in the examples.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for this case leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence due to the lack of conviction and only one arrest.",
