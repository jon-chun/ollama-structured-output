However, it's not as strong a predictor in isolation.\n\n- **Race**: Being White does not appear to increase risk when considered alone, but it must be combined with other factors like arrest history and age.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: Having multiple arrests (2 times) is highly indicative of increased recidivism risk. This factor plays a crucial role as seen in examples where multiple arrests align closely with positive outcomes for rearrest.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: A conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism, as evidenced by various cases within the dataset.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads to a prediction that this individual is likely to have a 3-year rearrest outcome of \"YES\", but there's some uncertainty due to overlapping influences and individual variations. Thus, confidence is set at 75%.",
