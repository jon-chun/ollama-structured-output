Therefore, its weight is low.\n\n2. **Gender:** Males generally have higher instances of recidivism compared to females in the dataset, making gender a medium-weight factor.\n\n3. **Ethnicity:** There is no clear trend that consistently associates ethnicity with recidivism outcomes, leading to a low weight for this factor.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** This factor shows a strong correlation with recidivism, as individuals with multiple arrests are more likely to reoffend. Hence, it has a high weight.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** While being convicted is associated with higher recidivism risk, there are cases where non-convicted individuals do not reoffend. Thus, it holds medium weight.\n\nGiven these factors and their weights, the prediction for a 21-year-old male who identifies as White, arrested twice but not convicted, leans towards \"NO\" for recidivism within three years. The confidence level is set at 75 due to mixed outcomes in similar profiles.",
