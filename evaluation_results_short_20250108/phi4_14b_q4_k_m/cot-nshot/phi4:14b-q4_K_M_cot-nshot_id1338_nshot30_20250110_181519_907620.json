At 20, this individual aligns more closely with those who have not been rearrested.\n\n2. **Gender:** There's no clear trend indicating that gender significantly impacts the likelihood of recidivism in these examples. Both genders appear fairly balanced across outcomes.\n\n3. **Ethnicity:** Hispanic ethnicity shows mixed results in the dataset, but several cases without conviction (e.g., Example #6) resulted in 'NO' outcomes. This factor is moderately weighted due to some high-risk Hispanic individuals but not consistently so.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** A single arrest aligns with many examples where the outcome was 'NO,' especially when no convictions followed.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** Not being convicted after an arrest strongly correlates with a lower risk of recidivism, as most 'NO' outcomes involve individuals without prior convictions.\n\nGiven these factors and their weights, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, albeit with moderate confidence due to some variability in similar cases.",
