This factor is moderately weighted because gender consistently shows a pattern in the data.\n\n3. **Race**: Being White doesn't show a high correlation with positive recidivism, but it does not strongly indicate negative outcomes either. Thus, it's given a low weight.\n\n4. **Arrest Count**: A higher number of arrests (3 times) generally correlates with higher recidivism in the dataset, making this factor highly significant.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Having been convicted is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, but when combined with other factors like gender and race, it becomes moderately weighted.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a lower likelihood of recidivism for this individual, leading to a prediction of \"NO\" with moderate confidence (75%).",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
