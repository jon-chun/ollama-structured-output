It receives a medium weight because it's relevant but not definitive.\n  \n- **Gender:** Gender does not show a consistent pattern for recidivism in these examples, with both males and females having NO outcomes under similar conditions. Therefore, it is given a low weight.\n\n- **Race:** While race appears to influence outcomes, the impact is not entirely clear-cut from the data provided. White individuals who have been arrested once without conviction generally see NO outcomes, suggesting some racial patterns but not strong enough for high weighting.\n\n- **Arrests Count:** The number of arrests plays a crucial role; those with multiple arrests often have YES outcomes, while one arrest usually correlates with NO outcomes, especially when there is no conviction. This factor receives a high weight due to its strong correlation with recidivism in the examples.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Conviction status is a significant predictor of future recidivism. Individuals without convictions after an arrest tend not to reoffend within three years, as seen in most NO outcomes. Thus, it has a high weighting.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for a 19-year-old White male arrested once but not convicted leans towards \"NO\" with relatively high confidence due to the strong correlation between conviction status and recidivism observed in the examples.",
