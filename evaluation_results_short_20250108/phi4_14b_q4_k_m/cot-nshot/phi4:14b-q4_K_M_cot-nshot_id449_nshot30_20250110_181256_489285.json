Thus, it is assigned a low weight.\n\n- **Gender**: Male gender appears to correlate with higher recidivism in these examples when compared to females. Hence, gender has been given a medium weight based on the observed pattern.\n\n- **Ethnicity**: There isn't a clear dominant trend for White individuals across different ages and outcomes (YES or NO). Thus, ethnicity is considered low in influencing the prediction.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: Being arrested once tends to have more 'NO' outcomes compared to multiple arrests. Therefore, this factor has been given a medium weight as it appears significant but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Not having a conviction strongly correlates with NO outcomes based on the examples provided. This suggests that without a conviction, recidivism is less likely, leading to high weighting for this risk factor.\n\nCombining these weighted factors, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, supported by a medium to high confidence level of 75, given the strong influence of not having a prior conviction and the pattern seen with arrest frequency.",
