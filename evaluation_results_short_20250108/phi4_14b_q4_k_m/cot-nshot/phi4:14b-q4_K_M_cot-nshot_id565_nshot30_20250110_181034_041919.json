Other racial groups exhibit mixed results, but Whites seem to have a pattern of lower recidivism rates under these specific conditions.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** With only one arrest, the impact is low. The data shows that individuals with just one arrest and no conviction consistently have 'NO' outcomes for recidivism in similar examples.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** This factor has a high influence. Convictions significantly correlate with positive recidivism outcomes ('YES'), while lack of conviction aligns strongly with negative recidivism outcomes ('NO').\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for a 19-year-old female who identifies as White and has been arrested once without conviction is 'NO' for 3-year rearrest recidivism. The confidence level is high at 85 due to consistent patterns observed in similar scenarios within the examples provided.",
