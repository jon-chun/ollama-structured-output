Age and gender are given lower weights due to their mixed outcomes or generally lower recidivism rates, while race/ethnicity and conviction status have medium influence as they show clearer trends in the data. Arrest count is low risk, aligning with fewer instances of reoffending when only one arrest has occurred without a conviction. The prediction leans towards \"NO\" for recidivism based on these weighted factors, with high confidence given the clear pattern from similar cases.",
