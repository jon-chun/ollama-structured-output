This makes age a moderately significant factor.\n  \n- **Gender:** Females in the dataset generally have lower recidivism rates than males, suggesting gender might decrease risk.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** The dataset shows mixed results for race/ethnicity impacts, particularly when combined with other factors such as convictions and arrest frequency. Mixed race isn't directly represented, but similar races show varied outcomes.\n\n- **Number of Arrests:** Two arrests place the individual in a moderate category; those with higher numbers often have worse outcomes.\n\n- **Convictions:** Convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism based on the dataset trends.\n\nGiven these factors and their analysis, this particular case leans towards a lower likelihood of recidivism, but not without some uncertainty due to mixed indicators in the dataset. Therefore, I predict \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest with moderate confidence.",
