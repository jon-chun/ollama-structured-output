However, there is no strong pattern suggesting high risk specifically at this age.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males have higher recidivism rates compared to females in the examples. This factor moderately increases risk.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: For Black individuals, the outcomes are mixed, with some 'YES' and many 'NO'. This suggests a moderate level of risk rather than high or low definitively.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: With 2 arrests, this is on the lower end compared to examples that resulted in 'YES', suggesting a lower relative risk from this factor alone.\n\n5. **Convictions**: Being convicted increases the likelihood of recidivism, as seen across several examples. This factor contributes moderately to the overall risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some moderate risk factors present (gender, race, conviction), others like age and number of arrests are not strongly indicative of a high likelihood of recidivism in this specific context. Thus, the prediction leans towards 'NO' with moderate confidence due to mixed signals from different risk factors.",
