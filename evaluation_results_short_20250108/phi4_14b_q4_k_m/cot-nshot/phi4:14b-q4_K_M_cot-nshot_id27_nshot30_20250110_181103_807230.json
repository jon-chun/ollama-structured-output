Age alone does not seem to be highly indicative of recidivism.\n\n2. **Gender:** This person is female, and throughout the examples, females generally have lower rates of recidivism ('YES') compared to males, especially when arrested without conviction.\n\n3. **Ethnicity:** The individual identifies as White. Many individuals in this category with a single arrest and no convictions did not result in 'YES' outcomes, though there are exceptions suggesting some interaction with other factors.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** With only one arrest, the risk factor is lower compared to those who had multiple arrests and experienced recidivism ('YES').\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** Not having been convicted further reduces the likelihood of a 'YES' outcome based on observed patterns in the examples.\n\nConsidering these weighted factors collectively, the prediction for no 3-year rearrest recidivism is made with high confidence due to the alignment of low-risk profile characteristics across several dimensions, especially given the pattern seen in similar cases. However, some uncertainty remains due to exceptions and interactions between factors. Hence, an 80% confidence level is assigned to reflect this balance between observed trends and potential variability.",
