Some individuals in this age group were rearrested, while others were not.\n\n2. **Gender (Female):** Across the dataset, females generally have lower rates of recidivism compared to males, suggesting gender as a protective factor against re-arrest.\n\n3. **Ethnicity (Black):** The outcomes for Black individuals are mixed; some are rearrested, while others are not. This suggests that ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor but still carries some weight due to varied results.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests (Single Arrest):** Those with only one arrest tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to those with multiple arrests, indicating that repeated interactions with law enforcement increase the risk.\n\n5. **Conviction Status (Not Convicted):** A high weight is given here because individuals who were arrested but not convicted generally show a trend towards no rearrest, possibly due to less systemic engagement or perceived lower threat level by authorities.\n\nThe prediction of \"NO\" for this individual's likelihood of recidivism in the next three years is based on the combination of these factors, with a high confidence level (85%) given the patterns observed in similar cases.",
