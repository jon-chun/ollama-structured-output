However, age alone does not strongly predict recidivism at this level based on available data.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females generally have lower rates of recidivism according to many studies and the examples provided do not indicate gender as a significant predictor. Therefore, it is assigned a low weight.\n\n3. **Race**: While race appears to influence outcomes in some cases, White individuals show varied results with fewer 'YES' outcomes compared to other races. This gives it a medium impact on recidivism prediction.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: With three arrests, the subject has experienced significant legal interaction, which is generally associated with higher risk levels according to the data (e.g., multiple examples showing high-risk individuals having more than one arrest).\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Being convicted significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as shown in several examples where conviction led to a 'YES' outcome.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, while there are some elements pointing towards a higher risk (number of arrests and conviction status), the individual's race and gender suggest a lower propensity for recidivism. The prediction leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence due to mixed signals from different risk factors.",
