This case falls in the age range with mixed outcomes but leans towards moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Males have more instances of 'YES' outcomes compared to females, suggesting slightly higher risk for males, though gender alone is not a dominant factor.\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"White individuals show varied outcomes, but the examples demonstrate that this factor does not heavily predict recidivism on its own.
