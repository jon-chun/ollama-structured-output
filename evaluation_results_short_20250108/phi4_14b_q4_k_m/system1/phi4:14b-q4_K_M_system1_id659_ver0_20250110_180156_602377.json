However, it's important to note that this analysis does not rely on stereotypical assumptions but rather the presence of significant behavioral patterns (i.e., multiple arrests and convictions).\n\nGiven these factors combined, there is a moderately high level of confidence in predicting higher risk. The confidence rating reflects both the significance of the criminal history and the limitations of demographic data without further context about the nature of offenses or rehabilitation efforts.",
