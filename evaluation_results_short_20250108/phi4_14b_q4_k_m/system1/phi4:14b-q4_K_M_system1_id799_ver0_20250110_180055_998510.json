While race alone should not determine risk, statistical data often show disparities in conviction and recidivism rates among different racial groups.\n\n3. **Criminal History**: With 2 prior arrests and at least one conviction, there is a history of criminal behavior that suggests an increased likelihood of future offenses compared to someone with no or minimal criminal history.\n\n**Confidence Level Considerations:**\n- The prediction confidence is set at 75 because while certain factors suggest higher risk (age, gender, previous convictions), the absence of more detailed information on the nature and severity of past offenses, rehabilitation efforts, social environment, etc., makes a full assessment challenging. Thus, there's room for variability in future behavior that isn't captured by these limited data points.",
