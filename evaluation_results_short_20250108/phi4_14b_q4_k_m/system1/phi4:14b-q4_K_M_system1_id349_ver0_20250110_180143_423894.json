However, age alone isn't a definitive indicator of high risk.\n  \n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Identifying as White does not inherently indicate high risk. Risk assessments should avoid biases based on race or ethnicity.\n\n- **Criminal History**: Having been arrested once and convicted is a factor that suggests some level of past criminal behavior, but it's limited to one incident. A single conviction may not indicate a pattern of high-risk behavior.\n\n- **Overall Assessment**: Given the limited information (one arrest and conviction), it does not strongly suggest high risk without additional factors such as repeated offenses, violent crimes, or other indicators like substance abuse or association with criminal networks.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 70 to reflect moderate certainty based on available data, acknowledging that more comprehensive information could alter the assessment.",
