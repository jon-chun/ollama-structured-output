However, mixed-race individuals may face unique social challenges that could impact reoffending risks differently depending on context (e.g., systemic biases).\n\n3. **Criminal History:**\n   - **Arrests:** Two arrests indicate prior encounters with the legal system.\n   - **Convictions:** Having been convicted increases the likelihood of future offenses compared to someone who has only been arrested but not convicted.\n\n4. **General Considerations:**\n   - Recidivism rates tend to be higher among those with previous convictions.\n   - The number and nature of prior offenses, as well as the time elapsed since last conviction, are critical factors that typically would influence risk assessment more precisely.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 due to limited data on specific circumstances surrounding her past arrests and convictions, such as offense types or rehabilitation efforts. More detailed information could refine this prediction further.",
