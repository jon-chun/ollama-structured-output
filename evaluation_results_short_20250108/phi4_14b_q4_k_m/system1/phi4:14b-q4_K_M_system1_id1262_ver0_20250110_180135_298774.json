This suggests lower risk compared to individuals with multiple convictions or patterns of reoffending.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the lack of more detailed information on other potentially significant factors such as substance abuse, employment status, social environment, and specific nature of past offenses (if any). These additional details could provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.",
