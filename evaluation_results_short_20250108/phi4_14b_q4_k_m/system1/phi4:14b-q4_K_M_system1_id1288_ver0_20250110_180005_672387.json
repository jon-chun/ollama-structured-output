However, race alone should not be used as a predictive factor without considering broader systemic issues.\n\n- **Arrests and Convictions:** Being arrested 9 times with multiple convictions suggests a pattern of repeated involvement in criminal activities, which is often associated with higher risk for future offenses.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the statistical likelihood based on these factors but acknowledges the complexity and variability inherent in individual cases.",
