Using race as a factor could lead to biased assessments.\n\n- **Criminal Record:** A single arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement with the justice system and does not strongly indicate high risk for reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\n- **Lack of Convictions:** Absence of convictions is generally seen as a positive indicator, reducing perceived risk compared to if there were multiple convictions.\n\nThe confidence level reflects that while these factors individually do not strongly indicate high risk, the lack of more detailed information about the circumstances surrounding the arrest and personal background limits certainty.",
