This suggests a higher likelihood of future offenses compared to individuals with fewer or no prior arrests/convictions.\n\n3. **Gender and Race**: While gender and race are complex factors that can influence risk assessment, they must be considered within broader societal contexts. Research often shows varying recidivism rates across different demographic groups; however, individual behavior patterns (such as multiple arrests) are more directly indicative of risk.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: Given the limited information provided, there is moderate confidence in predicting high risk due to her significant criminal history. However, comprehensive assessments typically consider a wider array of factors including socioeconomic status, substance abuse, mental health, and support systems, which are not available here. Thus, the confidence level is set at 75%.",
