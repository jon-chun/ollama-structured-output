Arrest alone is less predictive of future risk compared to a conviction record, which typically indicates more serious or repeated offending behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall risk profile appears low. However, there remains some uncertainty due to lack of detailed information on the nature and context of the arrest, hence a confidence level of 75%.",
