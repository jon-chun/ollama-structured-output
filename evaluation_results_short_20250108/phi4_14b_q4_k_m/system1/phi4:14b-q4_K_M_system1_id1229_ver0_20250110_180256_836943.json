Female offenders typically have lower recidivism rates than males.\n\n- **Ethnicity:** While race/ethnicity can be considered in some statistical models, it should not be the primary determinant of risk. However, systemic factors affecting different racial groups may need consideration without implying inherent risk based on ethnicity alone.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has only been arrested once and has no convictions. A lack of prior convictions generally suggests a lower risk compared to those with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nGiven these factors, the assessed risk is low, though not negligible due to potential systemic biases that could affect future encounters with law enforcement. Confidence is high because the key indicators (age, gender, criminal history) strongly suggest a low-risk profile.",
