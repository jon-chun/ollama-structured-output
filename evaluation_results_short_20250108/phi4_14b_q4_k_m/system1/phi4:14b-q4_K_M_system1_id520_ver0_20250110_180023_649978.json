This is an important factor indicating lower risk.\n\n- **Confidence Level**: The confidence level at 75 reflects moderate certainty based on these factors, acknowledging that there are other unmeasured variables (such as personal circumstances, social environment, etc.) that could influence the risk assessment. However, given the available information, a high-risk prediction is not supported.",
