This factor suggests a potentially lower risk level.\n\n- **Criminal Record:** The individual has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction indicates limited interaction with the criminal justice system, suggesting a lower risk of future criminal behavior.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given these factors, especially the lack of convictions and the generally lower recidivism rates among Asian/Pacific Islanders, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk. However, confidence is not absolute due to potential unknown variables or personal circumstances not provided in the data. Thus, a confidence level of 70 is assigned.",
