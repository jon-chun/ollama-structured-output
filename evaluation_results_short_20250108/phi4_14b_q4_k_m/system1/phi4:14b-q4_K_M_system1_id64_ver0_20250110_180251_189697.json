However, age alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\n- **Gender**: Research often indicates that females generally have lower recidivism rates than males, suggesting a potentially lower risk.\n- **Race**: The race factor here (White) has been used in some studies as a demographic variable but is less predictive of individual behavior without additional context. It is important to consider other factors before making assumptions based on race alone.\n- **Criminal History**: With only one arrest and conviction, the criminal history is minimal. A single incident does not strongly indicate high risk for reoffending, especially if there are no aggravating circumstances (e.g., violent crime).\n  \nGiven these factors, while caution should be exercised due to limited data on the individual's specific circumstances or underlying issues (such as substance abuse or socioeconomic status), the overall indicators suggest a lower risk of recidivism. The confidence level is set at 75% to reflect this assessment while acknowledging that additional information could alter the evaluation.",
