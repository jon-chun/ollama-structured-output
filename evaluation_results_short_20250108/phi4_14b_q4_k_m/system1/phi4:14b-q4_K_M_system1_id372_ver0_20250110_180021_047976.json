However, females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n\n2. **Race/Ethnicity**: Being White does not inherently suggest high or low risk in terms of recidivism compared to other racial/ethnic groups, as risk factors are more individualized.\n\n3. **Arrests and Convictions**: With three arrests and convictions already on record, the person has a history of involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a significant indicator of potential future offenses. Prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n**Confidence Level**: The confidence level is set at 75 due to the balance between mitigating factors (such as gender) and aggravating factors (age and prior convictions). Additional information on the nature of past offenses, current life circumstances, and support systems would help refine this assessment further.",
