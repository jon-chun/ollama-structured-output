These factors can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n- The combination of age, prior arrests, and convictions typically suggests a higher risk for future offending or re-arrest.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 85 due to the clear indicators of past criminal behavior but acknowledges that individual circumstances may vary and predictive certainty cannot be absolute.",
