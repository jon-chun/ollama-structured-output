However, this alone does not indicate high risk.\n\n- **Race:** Racial identity (Black) is a demographic factor that has been subject to systemic biases historically; however, it should not be used as an indicator of individual risk without considering other factors.\n\n- **Criminal Record:** The person has been arrested once but has no convictions. A single arrest with no conviction typically indicates a lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited information and lack of prior convictions, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk. However, there is moderate confidence due to the potential influence of other unaccounted factors in different contexts.",
