However, being female may slightly lower risk compared to males in similar situations.\n\n2. **Ethnicity:** Identifying as White does not inherently increase or decrease risk based on ethnicity alone; it\u2019s important to consider other factors alongside.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** With 7 arrests and at least one conviction, there is a significant history of interactions with the criminal justice system. This pattern suggests repeated involvement in illegal activities, which is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\n\n4. **Statistical Context:** Statistically, individuals with multiple arrests and convictions are more likely to reoffend compared to those with no or fewer prior offenses.\n\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects the combination of these factors indicating high risk, while acknowledging that individual circumstances and other mitigating factors could influence outcomes.",
