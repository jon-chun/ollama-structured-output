This does not imply inherent criminality but reflects broader socio-economic and systemic issues.\n\n- **Criminal History**: The individual has a prior conviction, which is often considered a significant predictor of future risk in many models.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 to reflect the complexity and variability in human behavior, acknowledging that while these factors suggest higher risk, they do not determine it definitively.",
