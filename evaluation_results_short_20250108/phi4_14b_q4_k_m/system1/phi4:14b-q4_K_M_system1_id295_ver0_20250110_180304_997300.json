Multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future risk.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:** While these factors suggest a higher risk, the confidence is set at 75 due to potential mitigating circumstances not accounted for in the data provided (such as nature of offenses, time since last conviction, rehabilitation efforts, etc.).",
