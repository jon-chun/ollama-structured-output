However, females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n- **Ethnicity**: While race can be a factor in risk assessments due to systemic issues, it alone does not determine risk level without considering other factors.\n- **Criminal History**: A single arrest and conviction suggest limited criminal involvement, which typically indicates a lower risk of reoffending.\n\nOverall, the combination of being young but having minimal criminal history suggests a moderate rather than high risk. The confidence is set at 75 due to these considerations balanced against inherent uncertainties in predicting individual behavior.",
