First-time offenders have lower recidivism rates compared to those with multiple convictions, but having one prior conviction is still a significant risk factor.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the inherent uncertainties and individual variability in behavior that can impact the accuracy of such predictions. While these factors collectively suggest an increased risk, they do not guarantee future criminal activity.",
