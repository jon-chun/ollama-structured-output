However, it's crucial to avoid bias based solely on racial identification.\n- **Criminal History:** Having at least one conviction increases the likelihood of future offenses compared to individuals with no criminal history, though one prior arrest and conviction is not definitive for predicting high risk.\n\nThe confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to limited data points but recognizes patterns often associated with higher risk in similar cases.",
