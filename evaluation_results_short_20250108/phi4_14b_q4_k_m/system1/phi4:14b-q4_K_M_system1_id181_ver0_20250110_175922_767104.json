A history of multiple arrests and at least one conviction is a significant factor that generally indicates higher risk for future offenses compared to first-time offenders.\n\n4. **Statistical Models**: Many actuarial risk assessment tools consider criminal history, age, and demographic factors as key predictors of recidivism. The combination of previous arrests and convictions typically elevates the risk score.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: A confidence level of 70 is chosen to reflect a moderate-to-high degree of certainty in this prediction. While there are strong indicators present (criminal history), other mitigating factors like age, gender, and lack of detailed information on the nature or severity of past offenses contribute to some uncertainty.\n\nThis assessment balances these elements based on empirical evidence from risk assessment research and statistical models commonly used in criminal justice settings.",
