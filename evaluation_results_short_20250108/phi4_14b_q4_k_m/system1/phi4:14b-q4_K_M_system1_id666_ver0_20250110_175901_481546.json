However, this alone is not definitive.\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race/ethnicity is considered, it should not be a primary factor without context of systemic issues; however, studies sometimes show certain demographic groups having different interaction patterns with the justice system.\n- **Arrest and Conviction History:** Having been arrested twice and convicted once indicates prior involvement in criminal activities. This historical data suggests a pattern that may predict future behavior.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 due to the presence of significant risk factors, but not enough data on other mitigating or aggravating circumstances (e.g., nature of offenses, rehabilitation efforts) to increase certainty.",
