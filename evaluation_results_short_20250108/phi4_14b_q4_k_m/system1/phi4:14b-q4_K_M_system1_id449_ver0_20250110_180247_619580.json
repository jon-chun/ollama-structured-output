However, age alone does not significantly predict future criminal behavior without other compounding factors.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While racial demographics can sometimes be associated with different levels of interaction with the justice system, using race as a standalone predictor is problematic and ethically inappropriate. It should not drive risk assessments.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** The individual has been arrested once but has no convictions. A single arrest without conviction suggests limited engagement in criminal activities that lead to legal consequences, indicating lower risk compared to someone with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the lack of convictions and only one arrest, these factors do not strongly indicate a high risk of future criminal behavior. The confidence is set at 70 due to some inherent uncertainty, as more context about the nature of the arrest or additional behavioral patterns could influence the assessment.",
