However, it's crucial to use these statistics responsibly and ethically.\n\n- **Criminal History**: Having been arrested once and convicted indicates prior involvement with the criminal justice system, which can be an indicator of higher risk for future offenses compared to someone with no convictions.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 due to the limited data points available (only one arrest and conviction) and the need to consider other potential mitigating factors not present in this scenario.",
