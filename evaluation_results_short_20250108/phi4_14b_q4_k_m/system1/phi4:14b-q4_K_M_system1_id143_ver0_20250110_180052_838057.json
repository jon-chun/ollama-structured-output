The person identifies as White, but ethnicity alone without more context does not significantly increase the risk.\n- **Criminal History:** An arrest with no conviction indicates limited interaction with the criminal justice system and suggests lower risk since there are no convictions that might suggest a pattern of behavior leading to re-offense.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 because while these factors generally indicate low risk, individual circumstances can vary significantly.",
