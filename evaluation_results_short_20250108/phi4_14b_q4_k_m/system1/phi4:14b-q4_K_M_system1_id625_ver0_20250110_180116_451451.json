However, being 19 is still relatively young within the age spectrum for criminal behavior.\n\n- **Ethnicity:** While some studies suggest varying recidivism rates across different ethnic groups due to systemic issues, this factor alone does not directly indicate high risk without considering other variables such as socioeconomic status or community support systems.\n\n- **Arrest History:** Having been arrested once but not convicted is a moderate indicator of potential risk. An arrest indicates involvement with the legal system, but the lack of conviction suggests that there might not have been sufficient evidence to result in a guilty verdict, which could imply either low culpability or procedural issues.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited information (one arrest without conviction), it is prudent to consider this individual as lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the lack of extensive data on other potentially relevant factors such as the nature of the offense, family background, employment status, or substance use.\n\nThis assessment reflects a balanced view considering both mitigating and aggravating factors based on typical patterns observed in risk assessments.",
