Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\n- **Race and Socioeconomic Factors:** While race can be associated with systemic biases that may impact arrest or conviction rates, it does not inherently indicate higher criminal risk without additional context.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The person has been arrested once but has no convictions. This suggests a low likelihood of recidivism as there is no established pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n- **Confidence Level:** Given the limited data and typical patterns observed in similar cases, confidence is moderate (75) because while some risk factors are present, they do not strongly indicate high risk without further information on circumstances or behavior.",
