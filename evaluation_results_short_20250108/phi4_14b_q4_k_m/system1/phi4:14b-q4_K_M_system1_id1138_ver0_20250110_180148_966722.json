While demographic factors such as age, gender, and race can be considered in some statistical models for recidivism prediction, they must be interpreted carefully and within ethical guidelines. Without further context on the nature of the arrest, personal history, or other behavioral indicators, it is difficult to assign a high risk based solely on these factors. The confidence level reflects this uncertainty while acknowledging that more data would provide a clearer picture.",
