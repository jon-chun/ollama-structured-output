Younger individuals can sometimes be more prone to risk-taking behavior, although this is not universally true.\n\n2. **Race and Gender Considerations**: While race and gender should not inherently contribute to a \"high-risk\" assessment in ethical practice, statistics might show disparities in conviction rates or recidivism that could influence the analysis. However, these factors are complex and context-dependent.\n\n3. **Criminal History**:\n   - **Arrests**: The person has been arrested 4 times. Multiple arrests can indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\n   - **Convictions**: Convictions carry more weight than arrests because they result from the judicial process confirming guilt. Having convictions suggests a history of engaging in criminal activity.\n\nGiven these factors, particularly the multiple arrests and existing convictions, there is an indication of a potential risk for future involvement with the justice system. The confidence level reflects this assessment while acknowledging that many other individual-specific factors (e.g., type of offenses, social circumstances) are not detailed here and could alter the risk profile significantly.",
