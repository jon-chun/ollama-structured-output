However, age alone does not strongly predict recidivism without additional context.\n\n- **Gender**: Female offenders typically have lower recidivism rates compared to male offenders, potentially lowering perceived risk.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Being White is generally considered neutral in terms of predictive risk factors for recidivism.\n\n- **Arrest and Conviction History**: A single arrest and conviction do not strongly indicate high risk, but it does suggest some level of prior interaction with the criminal justice system. The nature and severity of the offense are crucial here, which is unknown from the provided information.\n\nThe combination of these factors results in a moderate assessment of risk due to the individual's young age and existing criminal record, though mitigated by gender. Hence, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level reflecting uncertainty due to limited data.",
