Younger individuals can have a higher risk of reoffending due to various factors such as impulsivity or lack of life experience. However, being in early adulthood also provides opportunities for change and rehabilitation.\n  \n- **Gender:** Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males. This factor might suggest a lower risk.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race can intersect with various socio-economic factors that affect risk, without additional context on systemic issues or personal circumstances, it is not heavily weighted in this analysis.\n\n- **Criminal History:** With only one arrest and conviction, her criminal history suggests a low level of prior offending. A limited criminal record generally indicates a lower risk of reoffending compared to those with extensive histories.\n\nConsidering these factors together, the overall assessment leans towards a lower risk of future offending, hence the \"NO\" prediction. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the relatively sparse data and inherent uncertainties in predicting human behavior based solely on demographic and criminal history information.",
