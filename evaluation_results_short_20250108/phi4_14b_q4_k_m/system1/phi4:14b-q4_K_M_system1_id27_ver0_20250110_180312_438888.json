However, being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n  \n- **Ethnicity:** White ethnicity does not inherently indicate high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** One arrest with no conviction suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system, which is a positive indicator.\n\n- **Overall Risk Profile:** Given these factors, the risk of future criminal behavior appears low. The confidence level reflects this assessment while acknowledging some uncertainty due to lack of further contextual information.",
