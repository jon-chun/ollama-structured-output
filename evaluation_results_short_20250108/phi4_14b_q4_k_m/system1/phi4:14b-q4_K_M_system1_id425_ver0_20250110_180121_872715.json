However, being a first-time arrest without conviction lessens this concern.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** Identifying as White does not inherently increase or decrease risk in the context of recidivism or danger based on available data.\n\n- **Arrest and Conviction History:** The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This indicates that there is no established pattern of criminal behavior, which typically suggests a lower risk compared to repeat offenders with convictions.\n\nOverall, while certain factors like age might suggest some level of risk, the lack of prior convictions significantly lowers the risk assessment in this context. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to limited data on individual-specific factors that could influence risk further.",
