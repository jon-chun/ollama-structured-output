However, this factor is typically less predictive than others like age and prior convictions.\n- **Arrests and Convictions:** Having been arrested four times with subsequent convictions indicates a pattern of involvement with the justice system, which increases the risk of future offending.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple risk factors that are statistically significant in predicting recidivism, but acknowledging variability in individual behavior and circumstances.",
