Race alone isn't a direct indicator of risk without additional context.\n\n- **Criminal History**: With only one arrest and conviction, her criminal history is limited, suggesting a potentially low risk of reoffending compared to individuals with extensive criminal records.\n\n- **Overall Context**: The lack of detailed information about the nature of the offense or other social factors (employment status, education, etc.) limits the ability to predict high risk accurately. However, based on available data, the likelihood of being classified as high-risk is relatively low.\n\nThe confidence level reflects a moderate certainty in this assessment due to limited data but considering typical patterns observed in similar cases.",
