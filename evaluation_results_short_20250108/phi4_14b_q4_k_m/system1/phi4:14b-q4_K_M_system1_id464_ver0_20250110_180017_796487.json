However, this alone is not determinative.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** The individual has only been arrested once and has no convictions. An arrest without conviction typically indicates that there was insufficient evidence for a criminal charge or the person was found not guilty. This does not strongly suggest high risk.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited data (one arrest with no conviction), it is difficult to classify this as a high-risk profile. The absence of multiple arrests, convictions, or other aggravating factors suggests a lower level of risk compared to those with extensive criminal histories or violent offenses.\n\n- **Confidence Level:** A confidence of 70 reflects reasonable assurance based on the limited data provided, acknowledging that more information could alter the assessment.",
