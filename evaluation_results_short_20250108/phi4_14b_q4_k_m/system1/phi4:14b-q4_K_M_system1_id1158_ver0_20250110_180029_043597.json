This history suggests potential ongoing engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75, reflecting a moderate to high likelihood of risk based on these factors, but acknowledging the lack of conviction as a mitigating factor and the absence of detailed context about the nature of the arrests.",
