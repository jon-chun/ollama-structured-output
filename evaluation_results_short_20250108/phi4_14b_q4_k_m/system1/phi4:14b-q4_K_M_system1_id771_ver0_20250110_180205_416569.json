It's important to note that these factors should be considered in context with other variables rather than used as primary indicators due to potential biases.\n- **Criminal History**: Having been arrested 3 times and convicted indicates a pattern of criminal behavior which generally correlates with a higher risk of future offenses.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75, reflecting the presence of multiple risk factors while acknowledging that comprehensive assessments should consider additional personal, social, and contextual elements for more precise predictions.",
