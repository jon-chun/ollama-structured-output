However, this alone does not indicate high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Race:** While systemic biases exist in the criminal justice system, race itself should not be used as a determinant of risk. It is important to consider it within the broader context of social and environmental factors.\n\n- **Arrest History:** The individual has been arrested once but has no convictions. A single arrest without conviction suggests that there may have been mitigating circumstances or insufficient evidence for a conviction, indicating a lower level of criminal behavior.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given only one arrest with no subsequent conviction, the risk is not considered high at this stage. However, ongoing monitoring and support might be beneficial to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to limited data points but acknowledges that more comprehensive information could alter the assessment.",
