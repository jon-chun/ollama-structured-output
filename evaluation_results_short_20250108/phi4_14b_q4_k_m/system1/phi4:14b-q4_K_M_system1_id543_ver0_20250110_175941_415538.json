However, some uncertainty remains due to limited information about other potential risk factors such as family background, education, employment status, or substance use. The single arrest without conviction suggests minimal prior involvement with the criminal justice system, contributing to a lower assessed risk. The confidence level is set at 75 to account for these uncertainties and potential unknown variables.",
