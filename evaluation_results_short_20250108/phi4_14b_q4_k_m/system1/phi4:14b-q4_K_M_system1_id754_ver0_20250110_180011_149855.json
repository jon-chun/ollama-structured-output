However, his demographic information alone (White male) does not provide significant predictive value for high recidivism risk without additional context.\n  \n- **Criminal History:** He has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction suggests a lower risk compared to multiple convictions or a history of violent crime.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited information and lack of prior convictions, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk, though there is moderate uncertainty due to incomplete data on other potentially relevant factors (e.g., nature of the arrest, substance use, employment status). Thus, a confidence level of 75 is appropriate.",
