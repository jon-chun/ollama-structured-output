However, this is only one factor among many.\n- The person has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating that there isn't strong evidence yet for habitual criminal behavior or escalation in severity of offenses.\n- Race (White) alone should not be a determining risk factor without additional context regarding socio-economic status, environmental influences, etc., as it does not inherently indicate high risk.\n- Without further information on the nature of the arrest, prior conduct, personal circumstances, mental health history, or support systems, it is difficult to determine a high risk solely based on these factors.\n\nGiven this limited data and considering general trends without specific contextual details, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence.",
