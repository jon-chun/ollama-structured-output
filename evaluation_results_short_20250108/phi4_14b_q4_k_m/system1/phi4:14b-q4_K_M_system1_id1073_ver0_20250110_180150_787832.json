Young males with a previous record of arrests and convictions tend to have a higher risk of reoffending compared to other demographics without such histories. However, confidence is not at 100% due to the limited information on mitigating factors like employment status, education level, social support systems, or specific circumstances surrounding past offenses, which could significantly influence recidivism risk.",
