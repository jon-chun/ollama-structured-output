Age and gender are also factors that typically correlate with lower recidivism risk compared to older offenders or those with more extensive criminal histories. While race can be associated with systemic biases in the justice system, it does not inherently indicate higher risk on an individual level without additional context. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to limited information beyond these basic factors.",
