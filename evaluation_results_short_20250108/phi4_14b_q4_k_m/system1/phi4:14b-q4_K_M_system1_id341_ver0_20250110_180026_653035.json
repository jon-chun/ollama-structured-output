However, this must be approached cautiously and ethically to avoid bias.\n\n3. **Arrest Record**: Having been arrested twice is a significant factor. Although there are no convictions, the repeated arrests suggest possible patterns of behavior that could pose a risk.\n\n4. **Lack of Convictions**: The absence of convictions somewhat mitigates the risk assessment but does not eliminate concerns raised by multiple arrests.\n\nThe prediction leans towards \"YES\" due to these factors combined, though with moderate confidence given the lack of conviction and potential for bias in interpreting race-related data.",
