However, this is not definitive on its own.\n\n- **Gender and Race:** Male individuals statistically have higher rates of reoffending than females. Additionally, racial disparities in criminal justice outcomes can influence risk assessment, though these factors should be approached cautiously due to ethical considerations.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Having a prior conviction suggests a pattern that could indicate a higher risk of future offending compared to first-time offenders without any convictions.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65, reflecting the combination of relevant factors but acknowledging that individual circumstances and additional context (e.g., nature of past offenses, social support systems) are crucial for an accurate assessment.",
