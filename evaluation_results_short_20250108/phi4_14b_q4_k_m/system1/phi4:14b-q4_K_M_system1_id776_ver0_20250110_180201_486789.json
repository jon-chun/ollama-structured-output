While younger individuals may have a higher propensity for risk-taking behaviors, this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n  \n- **Gender and Race:** Being a male or identifying as White are demographic factors that can be associated with different statistical trends in criminal behavior. However, these should not be used in isolation to determine high risk without considering additional context.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has one arrest and one conviction, suggesting some engagement with the criminal justice system but not an extensive history of repeated offenses. A single conviction typically indicates a lower level of risk compared to multiple convictions or arrests.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment suggests that this person does not currently indicate high risk for future offending, though there is some uncertainty due to limited data, hence a confidence level of 70%.",
