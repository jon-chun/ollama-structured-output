Without further negative indicators (e.g., multiple arrests, convictions), this factor alone is insufficient to indicate high risk.\n\n- **Lack of Convictions:** Absence of prior convictions typically correlates with lower recidivism rates, as it indicates no established pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a moderate to high confidence that the individual does not present a high risk. However, without additional context or information, some uncertainty remains, hence an 85% confidence level.",
