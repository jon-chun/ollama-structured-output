Females often have lower recidivism rates than males.\n  \n- **Race and Systemic Factors:** While racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, this alone does not automatically indicate high risk without considering behavior patterns or other contextual factors.\n\n- **Criminal Record:** Only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system. A lack of prior convictions typically indicates a lower risk of future offending.\n\n**Confidence Level Explanation:**\nThe confidence level is set at 75, reflecting a moderate degree of certainty based on available data and general trends observed in similar demographics. However, individual cases can vary significantly, and additional context (such as the nature of the arrest or personal circumstances) could alter this assessment.",
