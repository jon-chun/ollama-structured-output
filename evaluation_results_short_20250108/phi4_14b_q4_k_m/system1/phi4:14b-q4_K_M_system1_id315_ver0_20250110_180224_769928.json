However, race should be considered within broader socio-economic contexts rather than as an isolated factor.\n- **Criminal History:** Two arrests with at least one conviction suggest prior involvement in criminal activity, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the consideration of these factors while acknowledging that individual circumstances and additional context (such as socioeconomic background or support systems) can significantly impact the prediction.",
