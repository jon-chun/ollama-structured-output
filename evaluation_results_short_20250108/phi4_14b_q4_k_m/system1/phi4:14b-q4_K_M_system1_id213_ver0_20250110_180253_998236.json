While this is not an individual risk factor per se, it may impact interactions with law enforcement and judicial outcomes.\n\n3. **Arrests without Convictions:** Having multiple arrests without convictions suggests a pattern of behavior that could potentially lead to future offenses or trouble with the legal system, indicating some level of ongoing risk.\n\nThe confidence score reflects moderate certainty due to limited information on other mitigating factors such as employment status, educational background, social environment, substance use, and mental health status. More comprehensive data would be needed for a more precise assessment.",
