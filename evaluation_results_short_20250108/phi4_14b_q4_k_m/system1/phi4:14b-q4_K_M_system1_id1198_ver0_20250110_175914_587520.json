The lack of convictions and incomplete information about other potentially mitigating factors (such as socioeconomic background, education, employment status, etc.) prevent a higher certainty in the prediction. Thus, the assessment reflects a moderate to high confidence based on available data but acknowledges inherent uncertainties.\n\n--- \n\nThis analysis is conducted with respect for ethical standards, acknowledging that risk assessments must be applied cautiously and contextually within broader social frameworks.",
