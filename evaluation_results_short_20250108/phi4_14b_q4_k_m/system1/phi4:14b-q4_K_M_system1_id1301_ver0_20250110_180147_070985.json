This indicates prior involvement with the legal system, which can be a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: Given the limited data available (age, gender, ethnicity, and criminal history), there is moderate confidence in predicting high risk due to previous convictions indicating potential patterns of behavior. However, additional factors such as family background, employment status, mental health, substance abuse issues, and social support systems are not accounted for, which could significantly influence the assessment. Therefore, a 70% confidence level reflects this balance between known risk factors and missing information.",
