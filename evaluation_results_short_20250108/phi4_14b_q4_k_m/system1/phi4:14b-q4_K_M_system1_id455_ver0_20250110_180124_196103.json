Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Being White may correlate with different socio-economic factors influencing criminal behavior.\n- **Arrest History**: Only one arrest without a conviction suggests either that the arrest did not lead to further legal consequences or it was for a minor offense. This does not indicate a pattern of criminal activity.\n  \nGiven these considerations, the risk is assessed as low (\"NO\"), with moderate confidence (75) due to limited data points but generally favorable indicators in terms of age and gender.",
