While these factors indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to a non-offender or someone with no prior offenses, it is important to consider other contextual elements such as the nature of the crimes, any rehabilitative efforts undertaken, or social support systems in place when making a more comprehensive assessment. The confidence level reflects an acknowledgment of these complexities and the general trends observed in risk assessment studies.",
