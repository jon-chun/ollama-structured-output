However, it should not solely determine the risk assessment.\n\n- **Criminal History**: The individual has been arrested once but has no convictions. This suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system and does not indicate a pattern of criminal behavior or high risk.\n\n- **Overall Assessment**: Given the lack of convictions and only one arrest, the risk is not considered high. However, it's important to continue monitoring for any changes in behavior or circumstances that might affect future assessments.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 85 due to the limited data available and the absence of more severe indicators of risk.",
