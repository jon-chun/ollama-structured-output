While age (21) is relatively young for predicting recidivism, it does not preclude risk. The number of prior arrests (4) and having been convicted at least once are significant factors associated with higher recidivism risk in many statistical models used for criminal justice assessments. However, the confidence level reflects uncertainties due to the limited data provided, such as the nature of past offenses or rehabilitative efforts made by the individual.",
