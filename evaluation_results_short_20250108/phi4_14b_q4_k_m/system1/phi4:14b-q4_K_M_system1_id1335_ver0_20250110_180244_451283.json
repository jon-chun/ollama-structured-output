This is a well-documented trend.\n\n- **Ethnicity:** While ethnicity alone should not be used as a predictor, research has shown disparities that can contribute to higher arrest rates among certain ethnic groups due to various socio-economic factors.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Having been arrested and convicted once indicates prior involvement with the criminal justice system. Recidivism rates are generally higher for individuals who have already had interactions with law enforcement.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 because, while these factors indicate a higher risk than average, they do not guarantee future criminal behavior. The prediction considers statistical trends but acknowledges individual variability and potential mitigating circumstances.",
