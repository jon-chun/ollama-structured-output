Being female may also contribute to a lower risk profile in certain contexts.\n\n- **Race and Ethnicity:** While racial disparities exist within the criminal justice system, race alone should not be used as a predictive factor for future offending without considering other contextual factors.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that there is no established pattern of criminal behavior or recidivism risk based on past convictions.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited information and absence of prior convictions, the risk appears to be lower. However, without additional context (e.g., nature of the arrest, social environment), a moderate level of confidence in this assessment is appropriate. The confidence score reflects some uncertainty due to the lack of comprehensive data.",
