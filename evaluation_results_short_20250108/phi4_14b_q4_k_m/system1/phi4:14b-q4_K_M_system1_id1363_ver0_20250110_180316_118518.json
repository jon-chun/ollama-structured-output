This requires careful consideration but cannot be the sole determinant.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Multiple arrests (6) with convictions indicate past involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects that while these factors suggest a higher risk, they do not guarantee future behavior. Other contextual and individual factors would be necessary to refine this assessment further.",
