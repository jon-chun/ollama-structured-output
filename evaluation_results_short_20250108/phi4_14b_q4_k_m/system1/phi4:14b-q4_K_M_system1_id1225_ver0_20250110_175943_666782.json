Additionally, some studies suggest that systemic factors may disproportionately affect Black individuals, although these are complex issues involving broader social contexts.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Having been arrested and convicted once increases the likelihood of future offenses compared to someone with no prior record.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple moderate risk indicators but recognizing limitations in data specificity and potential mitigating personal circumstances not accounted for.",
