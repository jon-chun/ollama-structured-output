However, age alone does not strongly predict recidivism without additional context.\n\n- **Gender:** Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males. This factor might suggest a lower risk, but it should not be the sole determinant.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** Being White does not inherently indicate higher risk. However, systemic biases in the criminal justice system can influence outcomes, though this is more about procedural fairness than individual risk assessment.\n\n- **Arrest and Conviction History:** Having been arrested once with a conviction suggests some level of prior involvement with the criminal justice system. While one arrest and conviction alone do not indicate high recidivism risk, they are factors to consider in conjunction with other variables.\n\nGiven these considerations, there is some indication of potential risk due to age and prior conviction, but without additional information on the nature of the offense, social support systems, employment status, mental health, or substance use, the assessment remains uncertain. Therefore, a moderate confidence level is appropriate.",
