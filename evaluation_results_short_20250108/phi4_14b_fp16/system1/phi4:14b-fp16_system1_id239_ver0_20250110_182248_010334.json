However, without specific contextual data on how these factors interact in a given area, this factor alone is less predictive.\n\n- **Arrest History:** The individual has been arrested twice, which can indicate a pattern of behavior leading to legal trouble. Although there are no convictions, repeated arrests might suggest potential for future offenses if underlying issues remain unaddressed.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Lack of convictions could imply that previous charges were not substantiated or resulted in non-criminal outcomes like diversion programs. However, the presence of multiple arrests still suggests some level of risk.\n\nThe confidence score reflects moderate certainty due to these considerations, but acknowledges variability based on additional contextual factors not provided here (e.g., nature of prior arrests, socio-economic background, etc.).",
