Research indicates that males generally have higher arrest and conviction rates compared to females.\n\n- **Arrests and Convictions**: Having been arrested 5 times with multiple convictions suggests a pattern of repeated offending or failure to rehabilitate, which is a strong indicator of high risk for reoffending.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the combination of these factors leading towards a prediction of high risk, while acknowledging that individual cases may vary.",
