It's crucial to focus on behavior rather than demographics alone.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** The person has been arrested once but has no convictions, which suggests that the legal system did not find sufficient evidence for a conviction. This factor alone is insufficient to predict high risk without further context (e.g., nature of arrest).\n\n- **Lack of Convictions:** No prior convictions are generally indicative of lower risk unless there's significant information suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to the limited data available and the complexity of predicting criminal behavior based solely on these factors. More comprehensive data would be needed for a higher confidence prediction.",
