Young adults can be at higher risk, but gender plays a mitigating factor.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** Being White does not inherently increase or decrease risk in isolation; it's the context and associated factors that matter more.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has only been arrested once without a conviction. This indicates limited interaction with the criminal justice system, which typically suggests lower recidivism risk compared to those with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited data (one arrest, no conviction), and considering demographic factors, the assessed risk is low. However, the confidence level isn't extremely high due to potential unknown factors not accounted for in this analysis.",
