However, females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n  \n- **Ethnicity**: While ethnicity can sometimes correlate with different risk levels due to socio-economic factors, the primary focus should remain on behavior and history.\n\n- **Arrest Record**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction typically indicates a lower risk of future criminal behavior compared to individuals with multiple convictions or ongoing legal issues.\n\n- **Lack of Conviction**: The absence of a conviction is a significant factor that suggests a lower risk, as it implies the individual may have not engaged in repeated criminal activity or was found not guilty of past charges.\n\nOverall, these factors combined suggest a low to moderate risk level. The confidence score reflects some uncertainty due to limited data but leans towards a \"NO\" for high risk based on available information.",
