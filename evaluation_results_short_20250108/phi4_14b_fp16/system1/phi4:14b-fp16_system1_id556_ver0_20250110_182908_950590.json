However, these findings must be interpreted cautiously and within a broader societal context.\n\n- **Arrests and Convictions:** Having multiple arrests (3 in this case) and at least one conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that increases the likelihood of future criminal activity compared to those with no or fewer interactions with the justice system.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the consideration of these factors while acknowledging the inherent limitations and ethical concerns in making such predictions.",
