The focus should remain on personal history and circumstances.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** Having been arrested once without a conviction suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system. Recidivism risk is typically higher among those with multiple convictions or longer criminal histories.\n\n- **Lack of Conviction:** A single arrest without subsequent conviction further reduces perceived risk, as it indicates that previous interactions with law enforcement did not result in findings of guilt.\n\nThe confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the limited information and reliance on statistical norms rather than comprehensive personal history.",
