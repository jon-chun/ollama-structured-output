This can be a moderate risk factor.\n- **Gender and Race:** Statistical studies have shown that young Black males are disproportionately represented in arrest and conviction statistics. While these should not be used as determinative factors, they do correlate with higher risks statistically.\n- **Criminal History:** Having been arrested twice and convicted once indicates prior involvement in criminal activity. A history of arrests and convictions is a significant risk factor for future offending.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 70 to account for the inherent uncertainty and complexity in predicting individual behavior based on statistical correlations alone. Individual circumstances, social support systems, and rehabilitation efforts are critical factors that can influence outcomes but may not be fully captured by this assessment.",
