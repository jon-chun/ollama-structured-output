However, without additional contextual data specific to this individual's circumstances, it does not directly indicate high risk.\n\n- **Criminal History:** A single arrest with no convictions suggests a lower likelihood of reoffending based on historical data trends. Convictions are often more predictive of future criminal behavior than arrests alone.\n\n- **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is set at 75 due to the limited information available and reliance on general statistical trends rather than specific, individualized factors that could alter risk assessment (e.g., nature of arrest, social/environmental context).",
