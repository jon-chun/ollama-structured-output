Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions:** Three prior arrests with at least one conviction indicate a history of involvement with the criminal justice system. This pattern suggests potential ongoing issues that may contribute to future risk.\n\n3. **Gender and Race Considerations:** While these factors alone are not determinative, they can be relevant when considering statistical trends in recidivism across different demographics.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is set at 75 due to the limited information provided (e.g., nature of offenses, rehabilitation efforts, social support systems). More comprehensive data could refine this assessment.",
