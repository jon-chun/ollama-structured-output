This indicates that while the person has had encounters with law enforcement, they have not repeatedly engaged in illegal activities resulting in conviction.\n  \nGiven these factors, this individual does not show strong indicators of high risk for future criminal activity based on available data. The confidence level reflects a moderate certainty given the limited information and reliance on general statistical trends rather than specific behavioral patterns or contextual details.",
