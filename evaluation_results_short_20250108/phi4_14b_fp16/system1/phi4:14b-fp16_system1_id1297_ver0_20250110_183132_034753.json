However, these factors are less predictive than others like past criminal history.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The fact that the person has been arrested and convicted once is a significant factor. Prior convictions are one of the strongest predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nThe confidence level of 60 reflects the consideration of multiple risk factors while acknowledging that predictions are not absolute due to individual variability and potential mitigating circumstances.",
