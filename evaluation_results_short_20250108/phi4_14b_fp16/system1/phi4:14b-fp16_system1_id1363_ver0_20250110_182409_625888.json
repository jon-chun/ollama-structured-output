The number of arrests and past convictions are significant factors in predicting future risk.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: A confidence level of 75 is chosen due to the presence of strong indicators (multiple arrests, convictions), while acknowledging that individual circumstances and additional context not provided could affect risk assessment accuracy.",
