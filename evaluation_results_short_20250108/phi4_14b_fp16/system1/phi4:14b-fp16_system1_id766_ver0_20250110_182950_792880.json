Additionally, White individuals often face different systemic biases than other racial groups in terms of arrest and conviction rates.\n\n3. **Criminal History**: With only one arrest and a single conviction, the criminal history is minimal. This suggests a potentially low risk of reoffending compared to someone with multiple convictions or ongoing criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: The confidence level at 70 reflects moderate certainty based on statistical trends, acknowledging that individual circumstances can vary widely and other factors not provided could influence risk assessment.",
