However, age alone isn't a definitive predictor.\n  \n- **Gender and Race**: Males generally have higher crime rates than females, and while race can be correlated with risk due to socio-economic factors, it should not be used as a primary determinant.\n\n- **Criminal History**: A prior arrest and conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that suggests potential future offenses. This factor significantly increases the perceived risk level.\n\nThe confidence is set at 70, reflecting moderate certainty based on these common risk indicators but acknowledging other potentially mitigating factors not present in the data provided.",
