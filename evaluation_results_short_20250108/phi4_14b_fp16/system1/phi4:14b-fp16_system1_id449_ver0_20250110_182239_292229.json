Young males are more prone to engaging in risky behaviors.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race should not be used as a primary determinant, research indicates that systemic factors can influence outcomes for different racial groups. However, this factor alone does not provide conclusive evidence of high risk without context.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests some interaction with the criminal justice system, which could indicate potential risk, although a lack of conviction may suggest that prior behavior did not meet legal thresholds for guilt.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 due to the limited data available and the complexity of accurately predicting risk based solely on these factors without additional context such as socioeconomic status, employment history, family background, or substance use.",
