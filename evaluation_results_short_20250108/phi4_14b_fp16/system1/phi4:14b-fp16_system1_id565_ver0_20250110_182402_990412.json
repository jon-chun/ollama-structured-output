The person is young (19 years old), which statistically presents higher risks in some contexts, but being female and having only one arrest without conviction are mitigating factors. Her demographic profile (White) also contributes to a lower statistical likelihood of recidivism compared to other demographics with higher average rates of reoffense. However, the assessment acknowledges some uncertainty due to limited data on personal circumstances or prior behavior beyond what is stated. Hence, the confidence level is set at 85.",
