However, these arrests have not led to convictions, suggesting either a lack of sufficient evidence for conviction or successful interventions at various stages.\n\n4. **Conviction Status**: No convictions suggest that previous charges may not reflect actual criminal behavior or successful legal defenses, possibly indicating low risk.\n\n5. **Lack of Additional Context**: Without further information on the nature of the offenses, current life circumstances, employment status, education level, and support systems, it is difficult to assess a higher risk accurately.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence (75), as there are mitigating factors such as age, gender, lack of convictions, but limited data on other crucial contextual elements.",
