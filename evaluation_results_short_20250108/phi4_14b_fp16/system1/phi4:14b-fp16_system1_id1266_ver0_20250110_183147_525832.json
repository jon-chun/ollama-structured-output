Being a female may indicate a lower risk level.\n\n2. **Ethnicity**:\n   - Ethnic background alone is not a reliable predictor of criminal behavior. However, systemic biases can affect arrest rates.\n\n3. **Arrest History**:\n   - Two arrests without convictions suggest encounters with law enforcement but no legal findings of guilt. This indicates potential for reform or lack of substantive evidence against her.\n\n4. **Conviction Status**:\n   - No prior convictions are a positive indicator, as individuals with no convictions generally have lower recidivism rates than those who have been convicted.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**:\n   - The confidence is set at 75 due to the limited data available and reliance on general trends rather than specific predictive factors unique to this individual. More detailed information (e.g., nature of offenses, social support systems) could refine this assessment.",
