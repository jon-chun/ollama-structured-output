    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Age:** The individual is relatively young (20 years old), which can be a factor in higher risk assessments due to impulsivity and lack of life experience. However, age alone does not indicate high risk.\n\n- **Gender:** Research often indicates that females have lower recidivism rates compared to males, suggesting a potentially lower risk level for re-offending.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race can be considered in statistical models due to disparities in arrest and conviction rates, it should not be the sole determinant of risk. The identification as White does not inherently indicate high risk without additional context or factors.\n\n- **Criminal History:** With only one arrest and no convictions, there is limited evidence of criminal behavior. This typically suggests a lower risk level compared to individuals with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the overall assessment leans towards a lower risk prediction, though some uncertainty remains due to the lack of comprehensive data on other potential factors such as employment status, education, family background, and social environment. Hence, a confidence level of 75 is assigned, reflecting moderate certainty in this low-risk prediction.",
