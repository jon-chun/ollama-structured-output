Recidivism risk often increases with multiple convictions or arrests.\n\n- **Overall Context**: Without additional information such as the nature of the offense, family and social background, employment status, mental health issues, substance abuse history, etc., it's difficult to accurately assess a high risk solely based on these limited factors.\n\nGiven this analysis, while there is some level of risk due to gender and arrest history, the available data does not strongly indicate a high risk. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the lack of comprehensive information typically required for a more definitive assessment.",
