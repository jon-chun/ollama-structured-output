While arrests without convictions do not equate to guilt, they indicate interactions with the justice system.\n\n3. **Lack of Convictions**: The absence of convictions may suggest either a lack of sufficient evidence or successful legal defense in previous cases. However, it does not eliminate the risk of future offenses.\n\n4. **Statistical Considerations**: Young males are often statistically at higher risk for reoffending compared to other groups due to various social and psychological factors.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The confidence is set at 65, reflecting moderate certainty based on available data and statistical trends. This accounts for the lack of convictions but recognizes the potential risk associated with previous arrests and demographic factors.",
