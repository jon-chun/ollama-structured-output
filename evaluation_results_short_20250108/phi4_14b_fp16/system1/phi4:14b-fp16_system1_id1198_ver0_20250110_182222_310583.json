However, this is a general trend and not definitive for every individual.\n  \n- **Ethnicity**: While ethnicity alone should not be used as a predictor of criminal behavior, systemic issues such as racial bias in law enforcement and judicial processes might result in overrepresentation of certain groups in arrest statistics. This does not imply higher risk but indicates potential biases that need to be considered.\n\n- **Arrest History**: Having multiple arrests, even without convictions, can suggest exposure to the criminal justice system and potentially risky environments or behaviors. However, since there are no convictions, it is less indicative of a high risk compared to having prior convictions.\n\nThe confidence level reflects these considerations and the inherent uncertainties in predicting individual behavior based on demographic factors alone. The assessment should always be supplemented with additional context-specific information for more accurate predictions.",
