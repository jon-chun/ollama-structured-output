However, this alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n- **Gender**: Female offenders typically have lower recidivism rates compared to male counterparts, suggesting a potentially lower risk level.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Being White is not inherently a high-risk factor in terms of recidivism, as race/ethnicity can correlate with systemic biases rather than inherent risk levels.\n\n- **Criminal History**: A single arrest and conviction indicate some engagement with the criminal justice system but do not strongly suggest a pattern of habitual offending. However, any conviction could elevate concern depending on its nature (violent vs. non-violent).\n\nGiven these factors, there is moderate confidence in predicting higher risk due to the presence of a conviction, despite mitigating factors like gender and lack of repeated offenses. The confidence level reflects uncertainty stemming from limited data.",
