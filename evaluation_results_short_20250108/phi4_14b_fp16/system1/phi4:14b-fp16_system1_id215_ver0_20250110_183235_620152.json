However, this does not eliminate risk entirely.\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race alone should not be used as a predictor, it is important to consider systemic issues that might affect outcomes.\n- **Criminal History:** Having been arrested twice and convicted once indicates prior involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\nThe confidence level of 65 reflects moderate certainty based on these factors, acknowledging that individual circumstances can vary widely.",
