However, this should be considered within the context of systemic issues rather than individual propensity.\n\n- **Criminal History**: Having been arrested and convicted once indicates prior involvement with the criminal justice system. This is a significant factor as it suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to first-time offenders without convictions.\n\nThe confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to limited data points (only one arrest and conviction) but acknowledges known risk factors associated with age, gender, and previous criminal history.",
