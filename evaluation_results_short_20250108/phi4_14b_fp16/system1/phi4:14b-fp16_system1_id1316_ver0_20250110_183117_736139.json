However, this alone does not indicate high risk without additional context.\n  \n- **Race:** While race is sometimes considered in risk assessments due to systemic biases, it should not be the primary factor in determining risk.\n\n- **Arrest History:** The individual has been arrested once but has no convictions. This suggests a lower level of criminal involvement compared to someone with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited information and lack of conviction history, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk. However, there is moderate confidence (70%) due to the potential for unknown variables not captured in this data set. Further information on behavior, social environment, and other contextual factors would be necessary for a more accurate assessment.",
