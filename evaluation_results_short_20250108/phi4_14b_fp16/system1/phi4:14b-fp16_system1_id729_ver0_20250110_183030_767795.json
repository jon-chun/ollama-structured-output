Although there are no convictions, multiple arrests can indicate patterns of behavior or associations with criminal activity.\n\n4. **Lack of Convictions**: While the absence of convictions is a mitigating factor, it does not eliminate risk. It's possible that future interactions with law enforcement could lead to convictions.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65 due to the lack of conviction history balancing against the other factors indicating potential risk. This reflects moderate certainty given the available information and typical statistical correlations observed in similar cases.",
