However, age alone does not dictate high risk.\n  \n- **Gender**: Males statistically have higher involvement in criminal activities compared to females, which can slightly elevate risk perception.\n\n- **Race**: While historical data shows disparities in arrest rates among different racial groups, race alone should not be a determinative factor for individual risk assessment. It is crucial to avoid racial bias in the analysis.\n\n- **Arrest Record**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement with the criminal justice system and does not strongly indicate high risk. Recidivism risk is generally higher among those with multiple convictions or ongoing legal issues.\n\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects moderate certainty, acknowledging that while some factors slightly increase perceived risk (age and gender), the lack of convictions and only one arrest suggest a lower likelihood of future criminal behavior. This assessment aims to balance statistical insights with fairness and individual evaluation.",
