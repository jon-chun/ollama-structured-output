However, this alone does not indicate high risk without other factors.\n  \n- **Ethnicity:** While there are disparities in the criminal justice system, identifying as White does not inherently imply a higher risk based on statistical data.\n\n- **Criminal Record:** An arrest without conviction suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system. This is generally considered a lower risk factor compared to multiple convictions or serious offenses.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** The combination of these factors\u2014particularly the lack of conviction and only one arrest\u2014suggests a lower risk profile. However, there remains some uncertainty due to potential unreported behaviors or circumstances not captured in this data. Hence, a confidence level of 70 is assigned, indicating moderate certainty in the \"NO\" prediction.",
