A history of multiple arrests can indicate a higher likelihood of re-offending, suggesting a greater risk.\n\n4. **Conviction Record**: Having been convicted increases the risk compared to only having arrests with no convictions.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a moderate to high level of concern regarding recidivism, leading to a \"YES\" prediction for high risk, with a confidence rating of 75. This reflects both the serious nature of her criminal history and some mitigating considerations related to age and gender. However, without more detailed information about the severity or type of offenses, exact circumstances, and social support systems, there is inherent uncertainty in this assessment.",
