A lack of prior convictions is a strong indicator of lower risk for future criminal behavior, as recidivism rates are significantly higher among those with previous convictions.\n\nOverall, the combination of being young, female, and having no convictions suggests a low risk, though some uncertainty remains due to limited data on individual behavior. Hence, a confidence level of 75 is chosen to reflect this assessment.",
