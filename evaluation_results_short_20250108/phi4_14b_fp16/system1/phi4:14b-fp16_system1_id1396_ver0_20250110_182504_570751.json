The combination of being a young male may slightly increase perceived risk based on historical data trends.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Having been arrested once with a conviction is significant. A prior conviction generally indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending compared to someone without any criminal record, as it suggests past engagement in criminal behavior.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the weight of these factors combined, acknowledging that while they suggest an elevated risk, other contextual factors (not provided) could significantly alter this assessment. The confidence is not at 100 due to limited information on mitigating or exacerbating circumstances such as nature and severity of the offense, social support systems, employment status, substance use history, etc.",
