The individual's self-identified race as White does not inherently increase risk.\n\n3. **Arrests vs. Convictions**:\n   - Two arrests without convictions suggest either non-criminal activity leading to arrest or successful legal defense.\n   - Lack of convictions reduces the likelihood of recidivism compared to those with prior convictions.\n\n4. **General Risk Assessment**:\n   - Research indicates that prior convictions are a stronger predictor of future criminal behavior than mere arrests.\n   - The absence of convictions, combined with demographic factors (age and gender), suggests a lower risk profile.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the lack of convictions and considering age and gender, the overall risk is assessed as low. However, due to the presence of multiple arrests, there is some uncertainty, reflected in a confidence level of 70%.",
