A single arrest with no conviction suggests a lower risk compared to multiple convictions or violent offenses.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Without additional factors such as history of violence, substance abuse, or other criminal behavior, the indicators suggest a moderate rather than high risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to limited data points and reliance on broader statistical trends.",
