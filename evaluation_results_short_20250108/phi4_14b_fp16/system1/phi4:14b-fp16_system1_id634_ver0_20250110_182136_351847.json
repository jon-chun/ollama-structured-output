Youth can be associated with higher risk due to impulsivity and lack of life experience, but this alone does not indicate high risk.\n  \n- **Gender:** Males generally have a statistically higher involvement in criminal activities than females, which could slightly increase perceived risk.\n\n- **Ethnicity:** Hispanic identity itself is not a risk factor. However, systemic biases might lead to increased scrutiny or disparities in the justice system.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has been arrested once and convicted once. A single conviction indicates some level of prior involvement with the criminal justice system, but it does not necessarily predict future behavior without additional context (e.g., nature of the offense, recidivism patterns).\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Given the limited data\u2014only one arrest and conviction\u2014the evidence to classify this individual as high risk is insufficient. The factors present are common among many young adults who do not engage in further criminal activity.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the moderate certainty based on typical statistical models and available information, acknowledging that more detailed personal history or contextual data could alter the assessment.",
