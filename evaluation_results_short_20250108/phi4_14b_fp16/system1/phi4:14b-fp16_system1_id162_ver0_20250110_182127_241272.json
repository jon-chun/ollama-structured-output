However, being in early adulthood also means there's significant opportunity for behavioral change and maturation.\n  \n- **Gender:** Males statistically have higher recidivism rates compared to females, but this alone doesn't indicate high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While some studies suggest disparities in arrest and conviction rates across different racial groups, race itself is not a reliable predictor of individual criminal behavior. It's important to avoid using race as an indicator of risk due to potential biases.\n\n- **Arrest History:** Having been arrested once without a conviction suggests there may be some interaction with the legal system, but it does not strongly indicate a high risk of future offending. Convictions are generally more indicative of recidivism risk than arrests alone.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment leans towards a lower risk prediction, with moderate confidence due to limited data on other potential influences such as social environment, employment status, and personal history.",
