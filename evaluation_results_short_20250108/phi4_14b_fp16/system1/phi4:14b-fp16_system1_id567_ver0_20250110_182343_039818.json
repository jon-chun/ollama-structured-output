Being an 18-year-old male increases the risk level compared to older individuals.\n- **Race and Ethnicity:** While race should not inherently impact risk assessment due to ethical considerations, statistical studies often show varying crime rates across different demographics. However, this factor alone is less determinative without context.\n- **Criminal History:** The individual has a prior arrest but no conviction. This indicates some level of interaction with the criminal justice system, which can be seen as an indicator of potential future risk, though not definitive.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\nThe confidence level is set at 65 because while there are indicators that suggest higher risk (age and gender), the absence of a conviction tempers this assessment. The lack of detailed context about the nature of the arrest further limits certainty in predicting high risk.",
