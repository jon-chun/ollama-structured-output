Previous convictions are significant predictors of future offending.\n\n3. **Demographic Factors:** While race itself should not be a predictive factor due to ethical and legal standards, statistical data often show disparities in arrest rates and recidivism that can influence risk assessments. However, this should always be approached with caution and awareness of potential biases.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is set at 75, reflecting the combination of relevant risk factors (age, criminal history) while acknowledging limitations due to lack of comprehensive information on other mitigating or aggravating factors such as employment status, substance abuse, social support systems, etc.",
