However, being a female White individual might suggest a lower risk compared to some demographics but does not eliminate the risk given her history.\n\n4. **Pattern of Behavior**: The repeated arrests point towards a potential ongoing pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of high risk for future offenses unless there are significant mitigating factors (e.g., recent positive life changes, engagement in rehabilitation programs).\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The confidence level is set at 75% due to the clear pattern of repeated arrests and convictions, but acknowledging that other unconsidered factors (such as nature of crimes, support systems, etc.) could influence risk assessment outcomes.",
