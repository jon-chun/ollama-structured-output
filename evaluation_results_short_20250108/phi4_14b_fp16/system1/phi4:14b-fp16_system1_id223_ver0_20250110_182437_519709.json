However, this is not deterministic.\n\n- **Race**: While racial demographics can correlate with certain statistical trends in crime rates, they are not definitive predictors on an individual basis due to the influence of numerous other factors such as socio-economic conditions and community environment.\n\n- **Arrest Record**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests that there was insufficient evidence for a legal determination of guilt or wrongdoing, which lowers risk compared to having convictions.\n\nGiven these points, while certain demographic factors can be associated with increased risks statistically, the lack of conviction and the context provided do not strongly indicate high individual risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with a moderate confidence level of 70%.",
