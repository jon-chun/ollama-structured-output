However, these factors should be contextualized within broader societal issues rather than used deterministically.\n\n3. **Criminal History**: Having been arrested 4 times with convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a significant predictor of future offending and thus contributes to a high-risk assessment.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the strong indicators present (age, gender, race, and criminal history), but acknowledging that individual circumstances can vary widely.",
