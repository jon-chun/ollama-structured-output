The person's self-identification as White does not significantly alter this risk assessment alone but is included for completeness.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** Being arrested 4 times with convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, which statistically increases the likelihood of future offenses. This history suggests a lack of deterrence from previous legal consequences and an increased risk of recidivism.\n\n4. **Convictions:** Having been convicted multiple times is a strong indicator of ongoing involvement in criminal activities. The number and nature of these convictions would further clarify the risk, but even without specifics, it contributes to a higher risk assessment.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n- A confidence level of 75% reflects moderate to high certainty based on available data points such as age, gender, and criminal history. However, other factors like social support, employment status, or interventions received are not accounted for, which could influence the outcome significantly. Thus, while there is a strong indication of high risk, it's not absolute due to potential mitigating circumstances not provided in the analysis.",
