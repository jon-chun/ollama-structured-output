However, race should be considered with caution due to potential biases.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** Having been arrested four times and convicted indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is set at 75 because while the factors suggest a higher risk, individual circumstances and other mitigating factors (e.g., support systems, rehabilitation efforts) are not accounted for in this analysis.",
