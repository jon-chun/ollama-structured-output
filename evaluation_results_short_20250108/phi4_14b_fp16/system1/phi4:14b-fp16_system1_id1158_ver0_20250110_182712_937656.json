While certain demographics may have higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, it's crucial to focus on individual behavior rather than stereotypes.\n\n3. **Arrest Record:** Having been arrested 7 times suggests a pattern of involvement with law enforcement, which can indicate risk even without convictions. The nature and context of these arrests are important but not provided here.\n\n4. **Lack of Convictions:** While no convictions suggest that the person may have avoided legal penalties, repeated interactions with the justice system could still imply potential risk factors such as recidivism tendencies or unresolved issues leading to re-arrests.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:** The combination of age, multiple arrests, and lack of convictions suggests a moderate to high level of risk, but without more detailed information (e.g., nature of offenses, rehabilitation efforts), the assessment remains somewhat uncertain.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to these considerations and the absence of comprehensive data on the individual's circumstances.",
