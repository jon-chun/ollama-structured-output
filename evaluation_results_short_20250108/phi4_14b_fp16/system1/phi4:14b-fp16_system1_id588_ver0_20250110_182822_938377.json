However, this is context-dependent and should be considered with caution.\n\n3. **Arrest Record**: Having an arrest without conviction suggests some level of interaction with the criminal justice system, which might indicate potential for future involvement, though it does not confirm high risk on its own.\n\n4. **Lack of Conviction**: The absence of a conviction is a mitigating factor, suggesting that previous legal issues may not have resulted in proven guilt or may have been minor.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: Given the limited data (age, gender, ethnicity, one arrest without conviction), there's moderate confidence in predicting higher risk due to age and initial interaction with the justice system, but this is tempered by the lack of convictions and insufficient broader context about personal circumstances or environment. Therefore, a confidence level of 65 is appropriate, reflecting moderate certainty with acknowledgment of potential variability based on additional factors not provided.",
