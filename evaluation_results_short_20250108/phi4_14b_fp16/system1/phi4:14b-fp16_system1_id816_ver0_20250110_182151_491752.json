Research consistently shows that females have lower recidivism rates.\n\n- **Ethnicity:** While ethnicity itself is not a direct indicator of criminal behavior or recidivism, it's important to consider systemic biases in data collection and judicial processes. However, without specific contextual data, ethnicity alone doesn't determine risk level here.\n\n- **Criminal History:** The person has one arrest and one conviction, which indicates limited prior involvement with the justice system. A lower number of past offenses typically correlates with a reduced likelihood of reoffending compared to individuals with extensive criminal histories.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to reliance on general statistical trends rather than specific data about this individual's circumstances, personal background, and current environment that could significantly alter risk assessment.",
