Youth can be associated with higher risk due to impulsivity or lack of maturity, but it also indicates potential for rehabilitation.\n  \n- **Gender**: Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: While systemic biases exist and should not influence risk assessment directly, statistical data often shows different patterns in offending among racial groups. However, race alone is not a predictor of individual behavior without additional context.\n\n- **Criminal History**: One arrest with no conviction suggests limited criminal involvement. A lack of convictions typically indicates lower risk compared to individuals with multiple convictions or a pattern of reoffending.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the limitations in available data and acknowledges that while these factors suggest a low risk, they do not account for all possible variables that could influence behavior.",
