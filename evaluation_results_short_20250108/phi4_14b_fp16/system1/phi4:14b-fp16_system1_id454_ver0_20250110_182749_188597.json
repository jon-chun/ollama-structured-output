However, age alone does not determine high risk.\n\n- **Gender and Race:** While these factors are often considered in broader studies on crime trends, they do not inherently indicate high risk without additional context such as the nature of past offenses.\n\n- **Arrests and Convictions:** Having been arrested twice with at least one conviction suggests a pattern of involvement with the criminal justice system. This history can be indicative of a higher risk compared to someone with no prior record.\n\n- **Lack of Additional Information:** Factors such as the type of crimes committed, time since last offense, rehabilitation efforts, and social/environmental factors are not provided, which limits the ability to make a precise assessment.\n\nGiven these considerations, there is moderate confidence in predicting a higher risk level due to past criminal involvement, but the prediction could change with more detailed information. Hence, a confidence score of 65 reflects this moderate certainty.",
