For a 19-year-old male with only one arrest and no conviction, the pattern suggests low risk.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females when other factors are similar. However, gender alone is not deterministic but contributes moderately to predictions.\n\n3. **Race**: Race appears less predictive of rearrest outcomes in this dataset. Individuals across different racial backgrounds with similar profiles had both positive and negative outcomes, suggesting a low impact on recidivism prediction.\n\n4. **Arrest History**: A single arrest without conviction correlates with lower rearrest rates compared to multiple arrests or those with convictions. This factor is moderately influential.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Convictions are highly predictive of future rearrests. The lack of a conviction in this case aligns strongly with outcomes where the individual was not rearrested, indicating high importance of this factor.\n\nGiven these factors and their weights, the prediction for a 19-year-old White male arrested once but not convicted is \"NO\" for rearrest within three years, with an 85% confidence level based on observed patterns.",
