Age and race/ethnicity have lower impact due to inconsistent outcomes across these factors, while gender and number of arrests have moderate influence. Conviction status is highly indicative of recidivism risk, with no conviction strongly suggesting a lower likelihood of reoffense. The prediction for this specific case is \"NO\" with high confidence, given the low number of arrests and absence of a prior conviction.",
