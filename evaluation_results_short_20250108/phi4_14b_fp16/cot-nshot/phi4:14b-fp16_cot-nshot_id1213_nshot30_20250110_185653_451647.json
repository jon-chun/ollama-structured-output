Thus, it is assigned a low weight.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males across the examples. This suggests that gender plays a moderate role in reducing the likelihood of recidivism for females, justifying a medium weight.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: There are mixed outcomes across different racial and ethnic groups, with no consistent pattern emerging from the data. Therefore, race/ethnicity is given a low weight.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: A single arrest generally correlates with lower recidivism rates in this dataset, indicating that having been arrested once without further arrests carries a medium level of risk.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: The absence of prior convictions is consistently associated with lower rearrest outcomes across examples, suggesting it is a strong protective factor and thus assigned a high weight.\n\nBased on these weighted factors, the prediction for this case is \"NO\" with 80% confidence, given that the protective factors (gender being female and no conviction) outweigh the moderate risk from having been arrested once.",
