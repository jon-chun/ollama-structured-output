Both males and females have similar rates of rearrest regardless of other factors.\n\n- **Race:** While race shows some variability, it alone does not strongly predict recidivism. However, when combined with other risk factors like multiple arrests or convictions, certain racial groups show higher recidivism rates.\n\n- **Number of Arrests:** A high number of arrests is a strong predictor. Individuals with 3 or more arrests frequently have a 'YES' outcome, especially if they are also convicted.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Conviction is a critical factor. Most individuals who were convicted and had multiple arrests were rearrested within three years.\n\nGiven the individual's profile\u201419-year-old White male, arrested 10 times, and convicted\u2014the combination of high arrest frequency and conviction status strongly suggests a 'YES' outcome for recidivism with high confidence.",
