Age can be a moderating factor as younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates.\n  \n- **Gender**: Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates across various datasets, suggesting that gender has less of an impact on increasing risk.\n\n- **Race**: As a White individual, the data suggests a trend towards lower recidivism compared to other racial groups in this dataset.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: Having multiple arrests is a strong predictor of future rearrest. This person has been arrested twice, indicating a higher risk factor for recidivism.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Convictions are a significant indicator of future criminal behavior. This individual's conviction elevates their risk level considerably.\n\nGiven the balance of these factors and trends observed in the dataset, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for rearrest within three years. The confidence is set at 80 due to the relatively consistent pattern with other similar cases in the dataset.",
