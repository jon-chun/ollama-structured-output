However, this factor alone does not determine the outcome.\n\n2. **Gender (low):** Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males across different racial groups and ages, as seen in the examples.\n\n3. **Race (low):** As a White individual, they are part of a demographic that typically shows lower recidivism in the given dataset.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests (medium):** Three arrests indicate some level of risk but not as high as individuals with four or more arrests. The impact is moderate compared to other factors.\n\n5. **Convictions (high):** Having been convicted, especially with multiple arrests, significantly increases recidivism risk according to the dataset patterns.\n\nThe combination of being female and White, along with the medium number of arrests but not a high number like 4 or more, suggests a lower overall risk despite having convictions. Thus, the prediction is \"NO\" for recidivism within three years, with moderate confidence due to the balance of factors.",
