Therefore, its weight is low.\n  \n- **Gender:** Males have a higher incidence of recidivism in the dataset, suggesting gender has some predictive power; thus, it's given medium weight.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity:** While race is present in the dataset, there isn't enough evidence to suggest a strong correlation with outcome when isolated. However, being Black and male seems more significant when combined with other factors like arrest history. Therefore, it receives medium weighting.\n\n- **Arrest History:** This factor shows a clear trend where more arrests correlate with higher recidivism outcomes, especially if there are convictions involved, indicating high predictive value.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Convictions tend to be associated with higher recidivism; however, in this case, the absence of conviction may reduce risk slightly. Thus, it's assigned medium weight.\n\nGiven these factors, for a 20-year-old Black male with one arrest but no convictions, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for rearrest within three years, with moderate confidence (75%) due to mixed indicators across similar profiles in the dataset.",
