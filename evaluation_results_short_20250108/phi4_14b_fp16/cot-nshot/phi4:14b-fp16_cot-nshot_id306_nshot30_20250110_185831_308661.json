This factor may offer some protective influence against rearrest.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: White individuals do not show a strong correlation with high recidivism in this dataset when other factors are considered, especially among females.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: Being arrested once is associated with lower rearrest rates, particularly without any convictions following the arrest.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Not having been convicted reduces the likelihood of future arrests, as seen across several examples where non-convicted individuals have lower recidivism outcomes.\n\nThe combination of these weighted factors suggests a low to medium risk of 3-year rearrest for this individual, leading to a prediction of \"NO\" with relatively high confidence.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
