Both younger and older individuals show mixed results.\n  \n- **Gender**: Being male is associated with a higher likelihood of recidivism, as observed in the examples.\n\n- **Ethnicity**: While ethnicity shows varied outcomes, Black individuals have both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes. However, there are instances where being Black correlates with lower recidivism when other factors like multiple convictions or arrests are absent.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: Having been arrested twice is a moderate risk factor. Those with more than two arrests tend to have higher recidivism rates.\n\n- **Conviction**: Conviction is a strong predictor of recidivism, as most examples with convictions result in 'YES' outcomes.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, particularly the presence of only one conviction and no excessive number of arrests, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for recidivism. However, due to mixed signals from other factors like ethnicity and gender, the confidence is moderate at 65%.",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
