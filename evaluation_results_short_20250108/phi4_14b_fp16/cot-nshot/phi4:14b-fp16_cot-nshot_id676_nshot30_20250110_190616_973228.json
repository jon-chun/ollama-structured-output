The examples show mixed outcomes for individuals in the age range of 19-22, indicating that age alone does not strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have a higher tendency towards recidivism compared to females across most examples, suggesting a moderate influence on predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"The person identifies as White.
