Example #16 supports this as an 18-year-old male with similar characteristics was rearrested.\n  \n- **Gender**: Males have consistently shown higher recidivism rates in the examples provided.\n\n- **Race**: While race alone should not determine outcomes, historical data often shows disparities that can influence risk assessments. However, it is less predictive than other factors here.\n\n- **Arrest Count**: With only one arrest, this factor suggests a lower risk compared to those with multiple arrests, but conviction status is more critical.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Convictions are strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates, as seen in examples #2 and #5 where convictions led to rearrests.\n\nGiven these weighted factors, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest within three years, with a confidence level of 75% based on the patterns observed in the examples.",
