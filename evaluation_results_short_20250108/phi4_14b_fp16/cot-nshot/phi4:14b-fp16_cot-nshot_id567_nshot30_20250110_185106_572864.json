Being slightly younger at 18 does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n2. **Gender:** Males in this dataset have shown higher rates of recidivism compared to females, which gives this factor a medium weight in the analysis.\n\n3. **Race:** Race appears less consistently linked with recidivism when considering other factors simultaneously. Therefore, it is assigned a low weight here.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** More arrests tend to correlate with higher recidivism. However, having only one arrest suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests, thus a medium weight.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** This factor has the highest impact; those without convictions have significantly lower rates of rearrest. The individual in question has not been convicted, which strongly indicates a low likelihood of recidivism.\n\nOverall, given the combination of these factors, especially the lack of conviction and only one arrest, the prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with an 85% confidence level.",
