This suggests a moderate influence on the prediction.\n\n- **Number of Arrests (Medium):** Two arrests without conviction have shown mixed results in terms of recidivism, indicating a moderate risk factor.\n\n- **Conviction Status (High):** The absence of a conviction is a strong protective factor against rearrest, as most 'NO' outcomes are linked to individuals who were not convicted.\n\nGiven these considerations, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of 75%, reflecting the significant influence of the lack of conviction and gender.",
