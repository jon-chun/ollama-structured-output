Thus, it's given a low weight.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: White individuals in the examples tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to Black or Hispanic counterparts, especially when controlling for other factors like convictions and number of arrests.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: A single arrest is less predictive of recidivism compared to multiple arrests. This factor suggests a low risk.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: The absence of a conviction is a significant protective factor against rearrest in the examples, indicating a medium weight for this factor.\n\nGiven these considerations, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence due to the lack of convictions and only one arrest.",
