However, this individual has only been arrested once, which does not strongly indicate recidivism.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: This factor is highly indicative; those without a conviction are less likely to be rearrested within three years.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for this 21-year-old White male who has been arrested once but not convicted is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with moderate confidence due to the limited number of arrests and lack of prior convictions.",
