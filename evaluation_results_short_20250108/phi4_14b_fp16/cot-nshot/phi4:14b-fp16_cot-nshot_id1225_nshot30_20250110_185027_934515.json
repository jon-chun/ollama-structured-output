It is rated as medium because it doesn't strongly predict one outcome over another based on provided data.\n\n2. **Gender:** Males have consistently had higher recidivism outcomes compared to females, suggesting a high influence of this factor towards predicting YES outcomes. However, not all males were rearrested within 3 years.\n\n3. **Race:** The impact of race is mixed for Black individuals in the examples, with some resulting in NO and others in YES. Therefore, it has been given a medium weight.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests:** With only one arrest, this factor alone does not strongly indicate recidivism outcome as both outcomes are observed in similar contexts. It\u2019s considered low influence based on the data provided.\n\n5. **Conviction Status:** Convictions generally correlate with higher rates of rearrest (YES) except for some exceptions, indicating a high influence towards predicting YES outcomes if convicted.\n\nGiven these weighted factors and considering that other individuals with similar profiles resulted in NO outcomes (e.g., Example #18), the prediction leans towards NO with moderate confidence. The mixed nature of the data regarding race and number of arrests contributes to this uncertainty.",
