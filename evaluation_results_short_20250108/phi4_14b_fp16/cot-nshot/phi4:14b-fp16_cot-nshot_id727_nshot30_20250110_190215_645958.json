Younger individuals (e.g., ages 18-21) are generally associated with higher risk, though this is not absolute.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Across examples, gender does not strongly correlate with recidivism outcomes; both males and females have mixed results regardless of their number of arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"White individuals who were arrested but not convicted show a trend towards lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnicities.

In these examples, White individuals who were arrested without convictions tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnicities under similar conditions.\n\n- **Number of Arrests:** This is weighted low because having only one arrest generally correlates with a lower likelihood of future rearrest, especially if no conviction follows.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** High weight is given here as examples consistently show those without convictions are less likely to be rearrested within three years. \n\nConsidering these factors and their respective weights, the prediction for this case leans towards \"NO\" with a high confidence level of 85%, based on the observed patterns in the example cases.",
