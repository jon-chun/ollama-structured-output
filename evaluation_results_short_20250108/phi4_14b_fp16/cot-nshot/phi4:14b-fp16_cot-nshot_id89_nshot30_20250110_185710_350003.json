White individuals without convictions tend to have lower recidivism rates, influencing this as a medium factor.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: A higher number of arrests generally indicates a higher risk, especially when coupled with convictions. This is a high-risk factor in predicting recidivism.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Convictions are strongly correlated with reoffending, making it a high-risk factor.\n\nGiven the individual's profile (21-year-old White male, 2 arrests, no convictions), and comparing to similar cases, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for recidivism within three years. The confidence is moderate due to mixed outcomes in similar profiles but leans on patterns observed with conviction status and arrest numbers.",
