However, the examples show mixed results for this age group.\n\n2. **Gender**: Males generally have more instances of recidivism in these examples, but gender alone does not strongly predict outcomes when other factors are considered.\n\n3. **Race**: Race is a factor, with some Black individuals showing higher risk, particularly if convicted. However, the lack of conviction here may mitigate this risk.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: Having been arrested twice places this individual in a category where recidivism is more likely compared to those with fewer arrests, especially when convictions are involved.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: The absence of a conviction despite multiple arrests suggests a lower likelihood of recidivism compared to those who have been convicted.\n\nOverall, while the number of arrests is a significant factor suggesting higher risk, the lack of a conviction and the mixed outcomes for similar profiles lead to a prediction of \"NO\" with moderate confidence.",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
