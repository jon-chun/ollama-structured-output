This pattern is consistent across the examples provided.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Being Black appears as a high-risk factor when combined with multiple arrests or convictions. The data shows that Black individuals have varying outcomes but are more likely to recidivate under certain conditions, making race/ethnicity an important consideration in risk assessment.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: A high number of arrests is strongly correlated with the YES outcome. This factor has a significant impact on predicting recidivism when combined with other elements like convictions and demographic factors.\n\n5. **Convictions**: Conviction status plays a crucial role, with individuals having been convicted showing higher likelihoods of recidivism. The presence of multiple arrests alongside convictions increases this risk significantly.\n\nIn the case of a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted, these factors collectively suggest a high probability of recidivism. The combination of frequent arrests and a conviction history strongly aligns with patterns observed in YES outcomes from previous examples. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with an 85% confidence level due to the alignment of multiple high-weight risk factors.",
