Out of all female cases with a 'YES' outcome, they are significantly fewer compared to males, suggesting gender could be a protective factor.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: There is no clear pattern indicating race/ethnicity as a strong predictor within the provided data, making it a less significant factor in this analysis.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests**: The number of arrests correlates with recidivism risk; more arrests typically lead to higher rates of reoffending. With only one arrest, the individual's risk is relatively lower compared to those with multiple arrests.\n\n5. **Conviction Status**: Convicted individuals show a higher likelihood of recidivism ('YES' outcomes). Since this person has not been convicted, it significantly lowers their predicted risk of rearrest within three years.\n\nGiven these analyses and patterns observed in the dataset, the prediction for an 18-year-old White female who has been arrested once but not convicted is \"NO\" with a high confidence level.",
