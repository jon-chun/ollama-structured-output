Therefore, it is assigned a low weight.\n  \n- **Gender**: Females tend to have lower rates of rearrest in the examples, suggesting gender has some influence on reducing recidivism risk. Thus, it receives a medium weight.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Black individuals show mixed outcomes depending on other factors such as conviction history and number of arrests. This suggests race/ethnicity plays a moderate role, warranting a medium weight.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: A single arrest has led to both recidivism and non-recidivism across various examples, indicating it is not a strong predictor by itself. Hence, it receives a low weight.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Convictions seem to have a stronger correlation with rearrest outcomes, particularly when combined with other risk factors. This factor is given high importance based on the dataset patterns.\n\nConsidering these weighted factors for a 21-year-old Black female who has been arrested and convicted once, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with medium confidence due to mixed outcomes in similar cases but noting the protective influence of gender.",
