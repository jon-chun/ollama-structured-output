However, being female might mitigate this risk slightly.\n\n- **Gender**: Females generally show lower recidivism rates across the board, suggesting a protective factor against reoffending.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: As a White individual, she aligns with those who have shown lower recidivism in similar scenarios (multiple arrests without convictions).\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: At 4 arrests, this is a significant risk factor. However, none of these resulted in conviction, which seems to reduce the likelihood of recidivism compared to those with convictions.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: The lack of convictions despite multiple arrests suggests a lower risk of recidivism, as seen in several examples where non-convicted individuals did not reoffend.\n\nThe prediction is \"NO\" for recidivism within three years, with moderate confidence due to the mitigating factors of gender and absence of convictions.",
