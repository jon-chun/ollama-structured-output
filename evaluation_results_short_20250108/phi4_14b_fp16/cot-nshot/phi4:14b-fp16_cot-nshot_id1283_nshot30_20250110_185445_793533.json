While age is a factor, it doesn't show as strong a correlation with the outcome in this dataset.\n  \n- **Gender**: Males have shown a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to females across most cases.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Race appears less predictive than other factors here; outcomes varied significantly within racial groups.\n\n- **Arrests Count**: With 8 arrests, the individual shows a pattern of repeated legal issues. This is a strong predictor of recidivism in the dataset.\n\n- **Convictions Count**: Having been convicted at least once contributes to the risk but not as strongly as multiple convictions or high arrest counts.\n\nGiven these factors, especially the high number of arrests and being male, there's an 85% confidence that this individual has a higher likelihood of recidivism within three years.",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
