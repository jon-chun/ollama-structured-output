This suggests that while age may play a role in recidivism, it is not the sole determinant.\n  \n- **Gender (Low)**: Being male does not strongly predict recidivism in this dataset, as both males and females have shown varied outcomes.\n\n- **Race (Medium)**: Race shows some patterns, but these are inconsistent across different examples. This suggests a moderate influence on recidivism risk.\n\n- **Number of Arrests (High)**: A higher number of arrests is strongly correlated with recidivism in this dataset, as seen in cases with multiple arrests leading to positive outcomes for recidivism.\n\n- **Conviction Status (Medium)**: Convictions generally increase the likelihood of recidivism, but there are notable exceptions where individuals without convictions do not reoffend.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for a 21-year-old male who identifies as White and has been arrested once without conviction is \"NO\" for recidivism within three years. The confidence level is set at 85 due to the moderate influence of age and race, alongside the high weight given to the number of arrests and medium influence of conviction status.",
