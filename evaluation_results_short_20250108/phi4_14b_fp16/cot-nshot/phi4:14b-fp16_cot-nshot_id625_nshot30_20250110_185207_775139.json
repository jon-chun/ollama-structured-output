Individuals aged 19 to 22 have varied outcomes, indicating that age alone is not a strong predictor.\n  \n- **Gender**: Males generally show higher recidivism rates compared to females in the examples provided. Therefore, being male is given medium weight.\n\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: While there are variations based on race/ethnicity, no clear pattern emerges for White individuals specifically. Thus, it receives a medium weight.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: Being arrested once does not strongly correlate with recidivism in the data set, suggesting low weight.\n\n- **Conviction Status**: Not being convicted is consistently associated with lower recidivism rates across examples, indicating high importance.\n\nThe prediction for this case is \"NO\" based on the weighted analysis, with a confidence level of 85 due to the strong influence of not having been convicted.",
