However, other races like Hispanic males with multiple arrests and convictions had high recidivism.\n\n- **Number of Arrests:** A high number of arrests (e.g., 5 or more) is strongly associated with a 'YES' outcome in several examples.\n\n- **Conviction Status:** Being convicted generally increases the likelihood of recidivism, as seen in most cases where conviction coincides with a 'YES' outcome.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for a 22-year-old Black male with 5 arrests and convictions is \"YES\" with medium to high confidence due to the strong influence of arrest frequency and conviction status.",
