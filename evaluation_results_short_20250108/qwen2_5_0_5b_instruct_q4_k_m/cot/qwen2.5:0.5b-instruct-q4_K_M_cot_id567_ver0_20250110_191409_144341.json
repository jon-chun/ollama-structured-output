He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. Based on the provided information:\n\n- The race (ethnicity) factor suggests a likely high risk.\n- The fact that he was previously arrested and did not get convicted indicates a relatively low risk in this area, even though it's still an arrest history.\n\nThe other factors are either neutral or low-risk, making all of them considered medium-risk together. Given the combined medium-high likelihood with only one factor being high-risk (arrest history), we assign **medium** weight to the arrest history.",
