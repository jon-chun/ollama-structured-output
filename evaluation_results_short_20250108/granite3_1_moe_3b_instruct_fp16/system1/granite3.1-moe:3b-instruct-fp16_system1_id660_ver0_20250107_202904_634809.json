These factors suggest a pattern of engagement with the criminal justice system, potentially indicating a higher likelihood of reoffending or continued involvement in criminal behavior. The confidence level is set at 95% as it's quite significant given multiple prior arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of potential risk.",
