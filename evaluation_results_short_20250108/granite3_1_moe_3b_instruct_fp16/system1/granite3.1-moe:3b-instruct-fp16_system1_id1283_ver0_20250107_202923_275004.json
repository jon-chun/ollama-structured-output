The racial identification as Black is statistically linked to higher crime rates due to systemic issues and socioeconomic factors, though this alone does not guarantee high risk. \n\nThe number of arrests (8) and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, which increases the likelihood of recidivism. This is further emphasized by his age range. The confidence score reflects the significant relationship between race and crime rates, but also acknowledges that individual circumstances can influence this risk assessment.",
