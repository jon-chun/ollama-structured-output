However, as there is still the possibility of future criminal activity due to this single arrest history, it's important for further investigation and monitoring by law enforcement or judicial authorities. The confidence level is set at 80% because while the individual has no prior convictions, arrest records do not necessarily indicate guilt or innocence; they merely suggest potential involvement in criminal activity.",
