Identifying as Black may introduce elements of systemic bias or profiling in the criminal justice system. Additionally, the fact that she has been arrested 7 times and convicted points towards prior involvement with the law, which generally indicates a higher risk of reoffending. The combination of these factors suggests a high-risk profile.",
