Arrests alone do not necessarily indicate high risk; they suggest potential involvement in criminal activity but do not guarantee future behavior. The absence of a conviction is a positive sign indicating that the situation may have been resolved without legal consequences. Therefore, based on these factors, her risk level is considered low.",
