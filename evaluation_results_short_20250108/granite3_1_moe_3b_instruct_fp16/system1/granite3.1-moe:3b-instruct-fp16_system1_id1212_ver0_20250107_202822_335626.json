Additionally, the person's race (being Black) should be examined within an inclusive context, considering potential systemic or societal factors that might influence behavior patterns. However, as a statistical analysis tool, it carries less weight individually than other risk factors present in this case. The 95% confidence level reflects the expert's judgment based on their extensive experience and understanding of criminal justice dynamics.",
