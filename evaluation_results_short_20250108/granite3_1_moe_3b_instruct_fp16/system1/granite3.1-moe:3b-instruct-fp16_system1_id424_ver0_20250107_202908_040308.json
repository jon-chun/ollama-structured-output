However, her four arrests suggest a potential for future engagement in criminal activities. The racial identity could also be considered, although it's important to note this alone does not determine risk level and should be evaluated within the context of other factors. The lack of convictions may indicate that the individual is still developing judgment or understanding her actions, which can sometimes lead to recidivism. Nevertheless, these arrests suggest a higher likelihood compared to an adult with no prior record.",
