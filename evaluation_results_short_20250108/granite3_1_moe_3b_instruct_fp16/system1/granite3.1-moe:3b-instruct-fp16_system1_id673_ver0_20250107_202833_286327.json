Age (20 years old): Younger individuals are often considered higher risk due to less life experience and maturity.\n2. Gender (Male): In general, males may be perceived as more prone to certain types of criminal behavior based on societal trends and research.\n3. Race/Ethnicity (White): While not inherently indicative of risk, this demographic has been historically overrepresented in the criminal justice system due to factors like socioeconomic status disparities.\n4. First-time offender: Being a first-time offender is often considered lower risk as it suggests no prior pattern or history of criminal behavior.\n5. Conviction: The fact that the individual has been convicted indicates they have engaged in criminal activity, which significantly increases their overall risk profile.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to predict a high-risk level with a confidence score of 95%.",
