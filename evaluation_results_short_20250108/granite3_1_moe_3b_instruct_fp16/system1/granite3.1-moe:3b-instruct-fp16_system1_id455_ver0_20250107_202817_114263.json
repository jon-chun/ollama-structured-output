However, being convicted is typically considered more serious as it signifies guilt and often involves further consequences such as fines or imprisonment. The person's race (White) could potentially introduce subconscious biases in the perception of risk, which may not accurately reflect her future behavior due to systemic issues within the criminal justice system. Therefore, while it indicates a certain level of risk, it is also important to consider these additional factors and potential biases when fully assessing risk levels.",
