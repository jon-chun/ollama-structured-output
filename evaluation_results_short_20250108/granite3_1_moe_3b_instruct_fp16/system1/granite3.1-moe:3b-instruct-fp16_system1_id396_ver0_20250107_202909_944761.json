Her ethnicity (White) suggests she may face systemic disadvantages or biases that could influence her actions and outcomes. She has been arrested once, indicating a history of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of high-risk potential. The fact that she has been convicted adds weight to this prediction as convictions are typically associated with more severe crimes or patterns of non-compliance with the law.",
