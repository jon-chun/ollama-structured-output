The individual is a young woman, which inherently increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Her identification as White and recent arrests/convictions are particularly concerning as they indicate a pattern of law-breaking activity. While having prior convictions does not definitively predict future actions, it suggests a history of disregard for legal boundaries, which is indicative of higher risk. The age factor also plays a role; young adults often struggle with impulse control and decision-making skills, making them more likely to engage in criminal behavior.",
