Her ethnicity as White may also be considered in the context of racial profiling or bias within the justice system, but this factor alone does not definitively determine high risk without considering the nature and frequency of her past offenses. The extensive arrest history (9 times) is a strong indicator of recidivism, suggesting she may pose a significant risk to public safety if released back into the community. However, it's crucial to consider individual circumstances, rehabilitation efforts, and support systems when assessing risk.",
