However, it's crucial to note that an arrest does not definitively indicate guilt or current criminal intentions. The lack of conviction may suggest innocence or insufficient evidence at trial. Age is also not typically considered a significant risk factor without additional context. Additional factors such as the nature and circumstances of the offense, the person's history of law-abiding behavior, and rehabilitation prospects would be necessary to make a more comprehensive assessment.",
