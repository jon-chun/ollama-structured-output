Being a White male also carries certain societal and potential implicit biases that could influence the criminal justice system, increasing the likelihood of arrests and convictions. The fact that this individual has been arrested 10 times already suggests a pattern of engagement in illegal activities or violations, which is highly indicative of high risk. However, it's crucial to consider mitigating factors such as rehabilitation attempts, support systems, and personal growth for a more comprehensive assessment.",
