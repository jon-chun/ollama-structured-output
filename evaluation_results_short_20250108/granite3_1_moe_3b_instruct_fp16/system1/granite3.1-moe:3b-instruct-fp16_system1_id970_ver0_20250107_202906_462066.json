His ethnicity, being White, does not inherently indicate high risk but could be a societal factor contributing to certain types of crime. The fact that he has been arrested three times suggests a history of criminal activity, which increases the risk level. His conviction indicates past successful prosecution, potentially indicating a pattern of breaking laws or rules. All these factors contribute to a high-risk assessment.",
