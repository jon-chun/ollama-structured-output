Age (22 years): Younger offenders are often considered high risk due to their immaturity, lack of life experience, and potential for reoffending.\n2. Ethnicity (Black): Racial or ethnic minorities may face systemic biases in the criminal justice system, increasing their likelihood of arrest and conviction.\n3. Prior Arrests: Having been arrested five times indicates a pattern of offending behavior, which is generally associated with high risk. \n4. Convictions: The fact that he has been convicted further emphasizes the severity of his offenses and the likelihood of recidivism. \n\nConfidence level is high due to these factors being strong predictors of reoffending and because they often correlate with criminal behavior.",
