Arrest records alone are not sufficient to predict recidivism or criminal behavior. However, given that she has not been convicted yet, it suggests a lower likelihood of immediate high-risk status. The lack of conviction indicates that the arrest did not result in a legal judgment against her, which is typically associated with low risk.",
