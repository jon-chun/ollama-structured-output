His ethnicity being White does not directly indicate risk; however, racial profiling or discrimination can be a significant concern in the criminal justice system. The fact that he has been arrested and convicted three times suggests an ongoing pattern of offending behavior, which is strong evidence of high risk to reoffend if released under community supervision. Therefore, these factors combined indicate a high risk of recidivism.",
