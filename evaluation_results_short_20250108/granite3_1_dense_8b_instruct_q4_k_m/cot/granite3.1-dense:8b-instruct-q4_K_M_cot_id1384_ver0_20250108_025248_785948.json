    "raw_message_text": "Here are the risk factors considered for predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. Age at first arrest - This factor is rated as \"low\" because, despite initial intuition, younger offenders do not necessarily have a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n2. Gender - The gender of the individual (female) is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males, thus it's rated as \"low\".\n3. Ethnicity - Being American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut is not directly linked to higher or lower recidivism rates in statistical analyses, so this factor is also rated as \"low\".\n4. Number of prior arrests - The fact that the individual has been arrested 2 times is a moderate risk factor for recidivism. It's rated as \"medium\" because multiple arrests suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, even if convictions haven't occurred yet.\n5. Conviction status - The individual hasn't been convicted yet. In most cases, this is considered a lower risk factor than having prior convictions. Therefore, it's rated as \"low\".\n6. Time since last arrest - Without information on the timing of previous arrests, we cannot accurately assess this factor. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the arrests occurred relatively recently, which could be a moderate risk factor for recidivism (rated as \"medium\").\n7. Age at first arrest - Given her age of 19, she was likely an adult when arrested, which is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to juvenile offenders. This factor is rated as \"high\".\n8. Lack of employment or education - Without information on current employment or educational status, we cannot accurately assess this factor. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume she doesn't have stable employment or education, which could be a moderate risk factor for recidivism (rated as \"medium\").\n9. Substance abuse history - Without information on substance abuse, we cannot accurately assess this factor. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume she has no reported substance abuse issues, which is rated as \"low\".\n10. Social support network - Without information on her social support system, we cannot accurately assess this factor. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume she lacks a strong support network, which could be a moderate risk factor for recidivism (rated as \"medium\").\n\nBased on these factors, our prediction is that there is a moderate chance of rearrest within 3 years:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age at first arrest\", \"high\", \"Older offenders tend to have higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"No direct link between being American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Conviction status\", \"low\", \"Not having prior convictions is generally associated with lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Time since last arrest\", \"medium\", \"Recent arrests can indicate higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lack of employment or education\", \"medium\", \"Unstable work and educational situations are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Substance abuse history\", \"low\", \"No reported substance abuse issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}",
