He is a young adult with only one arrest and no convictions. However, it's important to note that the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information available for assessment. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as criminal history, socioeconomic status, family background, mental health, substance abuse history, employment status, and other relevant details would be considered to make a more accurate risk assessment.",
