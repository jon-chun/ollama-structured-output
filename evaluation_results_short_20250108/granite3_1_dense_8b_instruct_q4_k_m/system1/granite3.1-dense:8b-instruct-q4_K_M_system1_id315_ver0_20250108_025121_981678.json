The fact that he identifies as White does not directly contribute to the risk assessment, but it provides context for understanding the individual's demographic profile. However, it's important to note that race alone is not a reliable predictor of criminal behavior, and any use of racial or ethnic data in such assessments should be strictly limited due to potential biases.",
