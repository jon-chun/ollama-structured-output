First, the individual is young (21 years old), which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders. Second, she identifies as White, and while race does not inherently predict criminal behavior, it's worth noting that this demographic group typically has lower arrest and conviction rates than other racial or ethnic groups in many jurisdictions. Lastly, the individual has a single arrest but no convictions, suggesting that she may not have completed the legal process. These factors combined indicate a low risk level, although it's important to consider additional contextual information for a more comprehensive assessment.",
