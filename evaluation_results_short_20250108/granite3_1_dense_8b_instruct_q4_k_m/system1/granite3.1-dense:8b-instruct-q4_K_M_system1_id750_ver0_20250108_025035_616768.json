The person's age (18), gender, and ethnicity do not inherently suggest a propensity for criminal behavior. The fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted suggests that the legal system has not found sufficient evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, based on this information, it is unlikely to predict a high risk of recidivism or future criminal behavior. However, the confidence level is set at 65 due to the limited nature of the provided data. More comprehensive information would be needed for a more accurate assessment.",
