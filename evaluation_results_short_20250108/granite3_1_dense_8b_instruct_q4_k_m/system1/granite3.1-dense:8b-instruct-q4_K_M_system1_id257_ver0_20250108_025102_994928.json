However, having been arrested once but not convicted does slightly increase the risk level. Given these factors alone, the confidence in predicting high risk is moderate (75 out of 100). It's important to note that a single arrest without conviction may not necessarily indicate future criminal behavior. Other contextual factors would need to be considered for a more accurate assessment.",
