His self-identified race as Black may also be associated with higher crime rates in statistical data, although this is a sensitive topic and not a definitive indicator of risk. The fact that he has been arrested once and convicted indicates past involvement in criminal activity, which is a significant predictor of future offenses. However, the confidence level is not high due to the limited number of arrests and convictions.",
