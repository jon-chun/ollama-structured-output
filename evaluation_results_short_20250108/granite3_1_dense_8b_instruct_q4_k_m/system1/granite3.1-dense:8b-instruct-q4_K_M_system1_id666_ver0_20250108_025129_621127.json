The individual's young age (18) and male gender are also associated with higher risk in general criminological research. The fact that he has been convicted suggests that his past arrests resulted in formal punishment, indicating a level of persistence or disregard for the law. Therefore, based on these factors, the prediction is \"YES\", with a confidence level of 75%.",
