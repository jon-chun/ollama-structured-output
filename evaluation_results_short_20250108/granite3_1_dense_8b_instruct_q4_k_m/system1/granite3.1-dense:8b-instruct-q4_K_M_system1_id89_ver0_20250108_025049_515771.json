The individual's age (21) and gender (male) do not inherently indicate high risk, but the fact that he has been arrested twice without conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future offenses. This is particularly concerning given his young age, as it could indicate a developing criminal propensity. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
