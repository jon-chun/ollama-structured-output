The individual's age (22) also suggests that they are within a high-risk age group for recidivism. The fact that they identify as Black may suggest potential racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but this factor alone does not indicate individual risk without context. Therefore, considering their arrest and conviction history, the prediction is of high risk with moderate confidence.",
