The fact that she has been arrested once and convicted suggests a level of criminal involvement. However, the age (22) and race (White) alone do not strongly predict high risk. The confidence score is set at 65 due to the presence of a conviction record, but it's important to note that without more information about the nature of the offense, the circumstances surrounding the arrest, or other relevant factors (such as prior arrests or current charges), this assessment should be considered preliminary and subject to revision upon receipt of further data.",
