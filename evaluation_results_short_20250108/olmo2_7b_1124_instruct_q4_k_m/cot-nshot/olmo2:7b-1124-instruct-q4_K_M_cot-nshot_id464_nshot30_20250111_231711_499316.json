The reasoning for assigning risk factor weights as follows:\n\n- **Age:** Low - Being 18 years old may suggest less experience in criminal behavior.\n- **Arrest Count:** Medium - One arrest indicates potential risk, but it is not clear if this is a single isolated incident or part of a pattern.\n- **Conviction Status:** High - The absence of a conviction implies a lower base level of risk compared to those who have been convicted.\n\nCollectively, these factors lead to a prediction that the individual has a medium to low risk of rearrest within three years.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
