The combination of numerous arrests and convictions typically indicates a higher risk for recidivism due to repeated criminal behavior patterns. Additionally, her age being relatively young implies a potentially lower baseline risk due to less established criminality, but this is counteracted by her substantial arrest and conviction history. Gender and self-reported race each have moderate influences, as there can be variations in recidivism rates associated with gender and racial identity, though not as strong as the other factors in this case.\n\nWith these considerations, the prediction is that she will reoffend within three years (YES), with a confidence level of 85%. This reflects a strong likelihood based on the extensive criminal history provided.",
