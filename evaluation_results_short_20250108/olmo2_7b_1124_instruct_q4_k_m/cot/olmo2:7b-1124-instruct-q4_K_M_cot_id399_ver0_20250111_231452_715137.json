While there is variability within racial groups, this factor introduces an additional layer of complexity that should be considered.\n\n**Prediction**: Based on the above analysis, the prediction is \"YES\" indicating a moderate likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\n**Confidence**: The confidence level is set at 75% to reflect the combination of the considered risk factors and their respective weights.",
