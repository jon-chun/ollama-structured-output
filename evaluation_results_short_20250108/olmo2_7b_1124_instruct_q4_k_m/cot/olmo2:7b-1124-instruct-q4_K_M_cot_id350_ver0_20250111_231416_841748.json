The reasoning behind the assigned weights is as follows:\n\n- **Age**: The person's young age (22 years) is rated as high risk due to studies showing that younger individuals often have higher rates of reoffending.\n- **Gender**: As a female, she falls into a demographic group with a medium risk for recidivism. While women typically have lower rearrest rates compared to men, the potential for reoffending still exists.\n- **Number of Arrests**: With two arrests, there is a noticeable pattern suggesting a higher likelihood of further criminal behavior within the next three years.\n- **Race**: No particular racial risk factor is identified for young white females in this context.\n\nThe overall prediction is affirmative due to the combination of her age, number of arrests, and gender suggesting a medium to high-risk profile for reoffending within the next three years. The confidence level reflects the degree of certainty in this assessment based on available data and research.",
