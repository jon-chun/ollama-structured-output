    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age can be a factor associated with higher recidivism rates due to less life experience and maturity.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests increase the likelihood of continued offending behavior, indicating a higher risk.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a predictor in some studies, individual behaviors and choices typically have a stronger impact than demographic factors alone.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions are a strong indicator of a history of criminal behavior and an increased likelihood of future offenses.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**: \n\n* **Age (High)**: Given the person's young age (22), this is a high risk factor. Research has shown that younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience and the development of greater impulse control.\n\n* **Number of Arrests (High)**: The fact that the individual has been arrested 9 times suggests a pattern of reoffending, which is a clear indication of high risk for rearrest within the next 3 years.\n\n* **Race (Medium)**: While studies often show racial disparities in the criminal justice system, this factor alone is typically considered medium-risk unless it interacts with other significant variables or is part of a larger systemic context affecting outcomes. Here, I've rated it medium because it's not the primary driver of risk in this particular assessment.\n\n* **Prior Convictions (High)**: The presence of prior convictions is a robust predictor of future criminal behavior. It suggests a history of engaging in criminal activities and continued involvement with the criminal justice system, indicating a higher likelihood of future offenses.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall prediction is \"YES\" for rearrest within the next 3 years with a confidence level of **80%.**",
