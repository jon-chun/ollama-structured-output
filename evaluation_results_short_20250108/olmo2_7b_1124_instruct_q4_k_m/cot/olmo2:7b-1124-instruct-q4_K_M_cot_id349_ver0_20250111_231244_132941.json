The presence of one prior conviction indicates a history of criminal behavior, suggesting a moderate level of risk. Race as a standalone factor is given a low weight because, while disparities exist within the criminal justice system, individual racial identity does not directly predict recidivism risk without additional context. Based on these factors, the prediction is affirmative with a moderate level of confidence at 75%.",
