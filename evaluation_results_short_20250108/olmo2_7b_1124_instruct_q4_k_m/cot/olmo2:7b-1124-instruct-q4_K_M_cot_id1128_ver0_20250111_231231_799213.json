The individual's age places them in a medium-risk category due to typical youth patterns of behavior. The self-identified race is considered low-risk, acknowledging that systemic issues affecting African American males are broader societal issues and not necessarily predictive on an individual level without additional context. The fact that this is their first arrest slightly mitigates risk due to lack of a pattern. However, the presence of a conviction marks them as high-risk due to legal consequences and often being a precursor to future offenses. Overall, there's a 75% confidence in predicting a 3-year rearrest.",
