The prediction leans towards recidivism due to the high weight assigned to age, prior convictions, and gender. However, the low weight for race acknowledges that racial identity alone does not significantly influence recidivism risk without more context. The confidence level is set at 75% to reflect a strong likelihood but acknowledges that no assessment can be 100% accurate.",
