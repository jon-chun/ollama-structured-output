This is based on general principles of fairness and avoiding racial profiling.\n\n**Prediction:** The individual has a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest within 3 years due to his young age, male gender, and prior conviction(s).\n\n**Confidence:** The prediction is made with 75% confidence, indicating a strong belief in the accuracy of the assessment.",
