The reasoning behind each risk factor is detailed in the corresponding textual explanation:\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is 19 years old, which is considered medium risk due to the typical developmental stage of being more impulsive and less experienced compared to older individuals.\n\n2. **Race**: Identifying as Black is categorized as high risk, considering that systemic barriers and higher arrest rates for Black individuals can contribute to a higher potential for reoffense.\n\n3. **Previous Arrests**: Having been arrested once indicates a pattern of behavior that could potentially lead to future offenses; this factor is rated medium.\n\n4. **Conviction Status**: The lack of a conviction suggests no legal consequences or rehabilitation efforts, which could imply a higher risk of reoffense; this factor is high.\n\nBased on these factors, the prediction is affirmative (\"YES\"), with a confidence level of 75. This means there is a 75% likelihood that the individual will be rearrested within three years based on the analyzed risk factors.",
