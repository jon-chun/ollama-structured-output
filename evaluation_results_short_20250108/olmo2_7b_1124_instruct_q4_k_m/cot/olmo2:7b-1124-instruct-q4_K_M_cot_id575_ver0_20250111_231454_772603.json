The confidence in this prediction is rated at 75%. This assessment is based on the understanding that younger males are statistically more likely to reoffend compared to other demographics, and having been arrested at least indicates some involvement in unlawful activities, though the lack of conviction suggests there may not have been sufficient evidence or it was a minor incident.",
