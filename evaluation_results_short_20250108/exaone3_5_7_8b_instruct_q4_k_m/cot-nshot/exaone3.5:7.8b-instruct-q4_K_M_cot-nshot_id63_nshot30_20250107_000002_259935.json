However, this is not deterministic and interacts with other factors.\n* **Gender (Low):** While gender can play a role in certain contexts, it's generally not a standalone strong predictor of recidivism without considering intersecting factors like ethnicity or criminal history.\n* **Ethnicity (Medium):**  Studies sometimes indicate disparities in recidivism rates across ethnicities, potentially linked to socio-economic factors and systemic issues. \"Hispanic\" is flagged as moderately influential here based on observed trends in the provided data.\n* **Prior Arrests (Low):** A single arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement in the criminal justice system and potentially lower immediate risk compared to repeated offenses or convictions. \n\n**Important Note:** This prediction is based on limited data and general trends. Real-world risk assessment involves far more nuanced considerations and professional judgment.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
