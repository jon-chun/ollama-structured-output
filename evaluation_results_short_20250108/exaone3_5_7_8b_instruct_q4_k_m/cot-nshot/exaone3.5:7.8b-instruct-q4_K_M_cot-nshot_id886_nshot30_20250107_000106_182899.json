However, it still introduces a notable risk factor compared to no prior arrests. \n\nThe **prediction** leans towards \"YES\" due to the combined influence of age and race, while acknowledging that a single arrest doesn't definitively seal the fate. The **confidence** score reflects this nuanced assessment \u2013 not overwhelmingly high due to the limited information but suggestive of potential risk.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
