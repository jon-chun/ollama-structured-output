First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 5 times but has not been convicted.\nOutcome: YES\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White.

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted.\nOutcome: NO\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
