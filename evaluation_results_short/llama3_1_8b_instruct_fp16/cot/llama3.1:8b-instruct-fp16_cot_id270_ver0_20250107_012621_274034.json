    "raw_message_text": "Here's my step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: As an 18-year-old, the individual is still relatively young. Research suggests that recidivism rates tend to peak in the early twenties. Therefore, I assign a weight of \"low\" for this factor.\n\n   (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young individuals typically have lower recidivism rates\")\n\n2. **Racial Identity**: Being White doesn't inherently increase or decrease risk; however, research indicates that racial disparities exist within the criminal justice system. Given the lack of specific information indicating higher risk factors related to his racial identity (e.g., gang affiliation), I assign a weight of \"low\" for this factor.\n\n   (\"racial_identity\", \"low\", \"White individuals do not inherently have a higher recidivism rate; however, without specific indicators of risk, it's assigned as low\")\n\n3. **Number of Arrests**: Having been arrested 2 times is a significant indicator of potential future arrests. It suggests that the individual may be more prone to engaging in criminal behavior. Therefore, I assign a weight of \"medium\" for this factor.\n\n   (\"number_of_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate a higher propensity towards criminal behavior\")\n\n4. **Conviction History**: Being convicted after an arrest is a strong indicator that the individual has been found guilty by a court. This suggests they have engaged in illegal activities and may continue to do so. Therefore, I assign a weight of \"high\" for this factor.\n\n   (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates a higher likelihood of continued engagement in criminal behavior\")\n\n5. **Gender**: Being male is generally associated with a higher recidivism rate compared to females. Males tend to engage more frequently and violently in crime. Therefore, I assign a weight of \"medium\" for this factor.\n\n   (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have historically been shown to have higher rates of recidivism\")\n\nGiven these risk factors and their assigned weights:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young individuals typically have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"racial_identity\", \"low\", \"White individuals do not inherently have a higher recidivism rate; however, without specific indicators of risk, it's assigned as low\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate a higher propensity towards criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates a higher likelihood of continued engagement in criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have historically been shown to have higher rates of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
