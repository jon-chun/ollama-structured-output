    "raw_message_text": "Based on the data provided, I would proceed as follows:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the age of the individual. In this case, he is 18 years old, which is considered relatively young in terms of criminal justice risk assessment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the number of times arrested and convicted. This person has been arrested twice and convicted once. While not a large number of arrests or convictions compared to some individuals, it's significant enough to warrant some concern.\n\nStep 3: Analyze his race/ethnicity. The data does not provide any information about his socioeconomic status or other factors that could impact recidivism risk, so we will have to rely on the limited information provided for this step. White people tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnicities.\n\nGiven these steps and assuming no additional factors were given, I would assign:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\"),\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"high\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n  \nThis means that the prediction is a high-risk one, but with relatively low confidence due to the limited data and information available. This individual should be closely monitored and possibly offered support services to reduce his risk of rearrest/recidivism.",
