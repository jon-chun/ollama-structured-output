    "raw_message_text": "To accurately predict the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual, we need to assess multiple factors. Here are three critical ones:\n\nFactor 1: Age (21 years old)\nReasoning: Generally, younger individuals have a higher propensity for criminal behavior due to immaturity and lack of experience with legal consequences.\n\nRisk Weight: High\n\nFactor 2: Race (Black)\nReasoning: Studies suggest that Black individuals are more likely than others to commit crimes. However, this is not an absolute predictor; it merely suggests a potential risk factor.\n\nRisk Weight: Medium\n\nFactor 3: Prior Arrests (1 time)\nReasoning: Having been arrested once but not convicted does not indicate criminal conviction and thus doesn't directly correlate with future criminal behavior.\n\nRisk Weight: Low \n\nBased on these factors, I predict that there is a high chance of rearrest recidivism for this individual in the next 3 years. \n\n{\n\"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally more likely to commit crimes.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Studies suggest higher criminal behavior among certain ethnic groups, but it's not absolute.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"Being arrested once without conviction doesn't directly correlate with future criminal behavior.\")\n],\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\"confidence\": 90\n}",
