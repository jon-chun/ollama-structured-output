This may be considered as a low-risk factor because it's relatively early in their life.\n\nFactor 2: Race - The individual identifies as White, which doesn't typically correlate with increased criminal recidivism rates.\n\nFactor 3: Arrest History - The individual has been arrested 8 times. This is likely to be a high-risk factor due to its potential impact on future behavior and decisions.\n\nFactor 4: Conviction History - The fact that the individual has been convicted makes this another high-risk factor as it indicates past criminal behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, we can predict with high confidence (95%) that there's a likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years. \n\nHere is the JSON object:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young adults may be more likely to change their behavior.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"There is no statistically significant correlation between race and criminal recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests could indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"A history of convictions indicates past criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
