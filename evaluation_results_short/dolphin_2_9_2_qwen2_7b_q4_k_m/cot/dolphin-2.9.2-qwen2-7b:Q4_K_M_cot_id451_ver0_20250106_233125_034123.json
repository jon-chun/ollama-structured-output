The factors 'Age', 'Gender', and 'Ethnicity' were rated low or medium based on their association with lower crime rates or less criminal history. The prediction was set to 'NO' meaning no re-arrest, given the low risk factors, but this would vary depending on other factors not included in this analysis such as type of offence committed etc. The confidence level is 75% indicating a moderate certainty based on the available information.",
