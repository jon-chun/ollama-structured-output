    "raw_message_text": "Based on the examples provided, it appears that a higher number of arrests and convictions correlate more with a \"YES\" outcome. However, the race/ethnicity of an individual does not seem to have a consistent correlation with the outcome.\n\nFor the current case:\n- Age: 22-year-old male - medium risk because age can be associated with maturity and behavior changes.\n- Ethnicity: Hispanic - low risk because no strong correlation was observed in examples.\n- Number of arrests: 2 times - high risk due to increased likelihood of recidivism following multiple arrests.\n- Convictions: Yes - high risk since convicted individuals are more likely to reoffend.\n\nConsidering these factors, the prediction for this case would be:\n\n{\n   \"risk_factors\": [(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"\"), (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"\"), (\"Number of arrests\", \"high\", \"\"), (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"\")],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nNote: This prediction is based on the given examples and might not be accurate for all cases.",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
