    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Hispanic. Her age is quite young; typically, recidivism rates are lower in younger offenders because they're still developing skills and life experiences. Being Hispanic might influence her support network or access to resources, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nShe's been arrested two times but not convicted. Having arrest records can sometimes be a red flag, but if she hasn't been convicted of anything severe, that might lower the risk. Since she has a GED and isn't in college, her educational background seems stable, which is usually associated with lower risk as opposed to those without formal education.\n\nShe's living alone, which suggests she doesn't have family support or maybe has had issues maintaining relationships. However, alone living can sometimes be a protective factor if she's managing her situation well, but it could also indicate instability.\n\nShe has no prior domestic violence history, which is positive. Not feeling depressed in the past month is another good sign; some risk assessments look for signs of mental health issues or substance abuse.\n\nShe's never married and living alone might imply she doesn't have children to raise, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk if she has other responsibilities like being a single parent, but here it seems she's not raising kids. Her lack of drug use in the past four years is excellent; drug or alcohol misuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some income can help reduce risk factors because it provides stability and financial independence. Plus, she has a support system from her biological mother living in an urban area, which could offer guidance and emotional support.\n\nHer religious beliefs suggest she might have strong moral values or support systems within her faith community, which can contribute to positive behavior and lower risk.\n\nPutting all these together: two arrests, no convictions, GED, not in college, single job, no drug use, living alone but with a supportive background. These factors lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
