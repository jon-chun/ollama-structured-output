    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let me break down each of the risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from a Hispanic background. Age-wise, being in her late teens is associated with higher recidivism rates because it's still early adulthood where people are more impulsive and less experienced. However, since she has two arrests but no convictions, that might lower the risk a bit because convictions can indicate more serious or prior offenses.\n\nShe weighs 155 lbs at 5 feet 4 inches. Weight alone doesn't seem like a significant indicator unless it's related to substance use or health issues. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign and might suggest better sobriety, so maybe not a high risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of lower self-sufficiency, but without more info on her support network or financial stability, it's hard to say definitively. However, she has a GED, which is equivalent to a high school diploma, so she might have the skills necessary for employment if needed.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, and that was without a conviction history. Having a job usually means she can support herself, which reduces risk. Plus, no recent drug use or depression in the past month suggests good mental health, which is another protective factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother at age 2 in an urban area. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and stress levels, but without knowing more about her living situation now, it's hard to assess if that directly affects her risk. However, early experiences can influence behavior, so maybe she has some underlying issues.\n\nHer religious belief in God is mentioned. Religious affiliation can correlate with prosocial behaviors, which would indicate lower risk compared to individuals with no religion or different beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: She's young but not a first-time offender; has positive factors like education and job; no drug use or recent mental health issues. The only negative points are her age and living alone, but those might be mitigated by other strong factors. So I'm leaning towards a lower risk with some uncertainty.\n\nWait, the user wants a confidence level between 0 and 100 for high risk. Considering all these factors, maybe around 35% confidence. That's not high enough to label her as risky but also not low. She doesn't have any clear red flags that would push her into a high-risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
