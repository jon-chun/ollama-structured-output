    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk. I'm not too familiar with all the specifics, but I'll go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female of Hispanic descent. That alone doesn't raise red flags, but it's something to note for demographic analysis. She's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. So her criminal history is limited, which might actually lower her risk compared to someone with more convictions.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 155 lbs. I don't know if those stats are relevant here, but maybe her weight could be a factor in other areas like substance use or health issues, though she hasn't used drugs in the past four years.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Singles living on their own can sometimes be more isolated, which might contribute to higher stress levels or substance abuse, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently and doesn't use drugs, that's a positive sign.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not having a degree could mean she's seeking further education, which is a good indicator of stability. She's only held one job during the year; maybe she's unemployed or underemployed, but again, without more info on her income or job security, it's hard to tell.\n\nHer drug use history is clean for four years, so that's definitely a positive factor. No recent substance abuse could mean lower risk of reoffending in that area.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests good mental health. That\u2019s another point working in her favor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Maybe living in an urban environment can have its pros and cons, but without knowing if there were any issues or stressors during those years, it's hard to say.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her life, which is a strong positive indicator for mental health and personal well-being. Believing in a higher power often correlates with better coping mechanisms and lower rates of substance abuse and depression.\n\nPutting this all together: limited arrests, no drug use, good mental health, positive beliefs about her faith, and a clean record otherwise. While she's young and has some challenges like living alone or having only one job, the lack of significant criminal history and positive personal factors probably keep her risk level low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
