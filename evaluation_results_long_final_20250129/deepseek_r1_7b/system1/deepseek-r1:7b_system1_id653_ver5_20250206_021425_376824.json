    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and analyze them.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female Hispanic. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk on its own, but being young might mean she has more time ahead of her to develop certain habits or issues.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be a point in her favor because maybe she can turn around and do better without facing the consequences. However, arrest counts alone don't necessarily correlate with high risk unless there are other factors like prior convictions.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and weight is 155 lbs. These are standard measurements for a young adult, so nothing stands out here regarding her physical condition that could affect risk assessment.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher stress levels or isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or mental health issues if not addressed properly.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school is a known risk factor because it might limit opportunities for education and job training, potentially leading to unstable situations or involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n\nShe held one job during the year and hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Employment can be protective if it provides stability, but using no drugs isn't necessarily directly linked to high risk unless other factors are present.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign as mental health issues like depression can influence substance use or criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. This might suggest family environment could have some influence on her behavior, but it's not a direct indicator without more context.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. This could indicate strong moral values and a religious foundation that might help prevent certain behaviors if properly integrated into daily life.\n\nPutting this all together: She has low recidivism rate (arrested twice, no conviction), but other factors like lack of education, living alone, and limited employment. Her positive indicators include no recent drug use and belief in God. Without more concerning signs like substance abuse or violent behavior history, the risk might be moderate to low.\n\nTherefore, her overall risk seems to indicate a lower risk with some potential vulnerabilities that could be addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
