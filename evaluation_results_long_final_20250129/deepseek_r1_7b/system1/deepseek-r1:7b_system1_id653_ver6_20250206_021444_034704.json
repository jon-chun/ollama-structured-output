    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor for a 19-year-old female and determine if it indicates high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Since there are no convictions, that might not show a clear pattern of criminal behavior yet. However, two arrests could suggest some prior issues or maybe she's trying to avoid trouble now.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic, which isn't directly related to risk unless there's demographic data showing higher recidivism rates in this group, but I don't have specific statistics here.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and weight 155 lbs. No immediate red flags from body type or size; she could be average for her age.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might imply she's independent, which usually is a protective factor, but it can also mean she doesn't have support networks that might help her if something goes wrong.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or college could indicate lower educational expectations, possibly leading to less motivation for positive choices.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least some work experience is generally good, but not working much else could mean she's relying solely on that income, which might be unstable if her job changes or ends.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. These are positive indicators of stability and health, reducing potential risk factors related to substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a close environment can have both protective (like family support) and risk factors (if there were disciplinary issues).\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with her life is a strong positive indicator, showing she has faith and personal values that guide her actions.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests without convictions, living alone, educational background issues, but no drug use or depression. The lack of convictions might indicate she's trying hard, and the personal support from family could be protective. Her job history is minimal but not negative. No signs of substance abuse or mental health issues. So overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't point strongly towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
