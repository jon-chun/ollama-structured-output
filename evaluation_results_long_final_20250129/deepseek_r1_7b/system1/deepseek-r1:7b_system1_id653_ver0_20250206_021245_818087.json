    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment case for a 19-year-old female who's been arrested twice but not convicted. She's Hispanic, living alone, and has a GED without college enrollment. Her job history is just one, no drug use in the past four years, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. She grew up with her mom in an urban area of size two and believes in God.\n\nFirst, her age being 19 might be a factor, but it's also early for recidivism typically. Her lack of convictions despite arrests could indicate she's managed to avoid legal trouble, which is positive. The GED suggests some education background, though not college, which might present challenges elsewhere.\n\nLiving alone at this young age could mean she's independent or perhaps went through a tough childhood that left her on her own early. No drug use and no recent depression are strong negative indicators showing good mental health and substance use management.\n\nShe has biological parents in an urban household; maybe she had a stable upbringing, but it's hard to say without more context about the family dynamics. Her religious belief could influence her behavior, which is somewhat positive if it's guiding her towards better decisions.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: two minor offenses, GED, living alone, no drug use, recent mental well-being. These seem like they might indicate low risk, but the lack of a conviction despite past arrests could still be a concern. She hasn't been convicted before; perhaps she's motivated to change or has good support systems.\n\nHowever, without knowing her family situation beyond that brief mention, it's tricky. Maybe her living alone and young age suggest she doesn't have many responsibilities yet. The positive factors like GED, no drug use, and recent mental health could lean towards low risk.\n\nBut the two prior arrests do add some uncertainty. I'm leaning towards a low risk prediction but with cautious confidence because of those past issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
