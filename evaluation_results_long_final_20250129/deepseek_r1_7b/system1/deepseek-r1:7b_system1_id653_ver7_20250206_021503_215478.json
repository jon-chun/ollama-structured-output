    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this risk assessment analysis. I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk and then provide a JSON response with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female of Hispanic descent. She's been arrested twice but not convicted yet. That's two misdemeanor convictions, which might indicate some past behavior issues, but since they're misdemeanors and not felonies, maybe it's less severe than someone with a full conviction.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 155 lbs. That's on the lower side for her age group; she might be at a healthy weight considering her height. No significant weight issues here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which is a risk factor, but without other factors, it's not immediately high risk unless combined with other issues.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Completing high school is generally good, so maybe this isn't an issue. Not attending college could be a concern if she's avoiding educational opportunities, but again, alone.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single job can contribute to financial stability, which reduces risk of unemployment or poverty issues.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in a month. That's positive; no substance abuse, no recent mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. That might be a supportive environment, but not necessarily a risk factor unless there are other family issues or neglect reported elsewhere.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal life. Positive religious involvement can contribute to mental stability and self-efficacy.\n\nPutting this all together: two misdemeanor arrests (not convictions), living alone, GED, single job, no drug use, recent positive mental health check, supportive family background, and religious involvement. These factors don't immediately point towards high risk of reoffending or significant personal issues. However, the lack of a conviction is notable but not inherently low risk without more context.\n\nI might lean towards \"NO\" with lower confidence because there are no clear high-risk indicators like active substance use, mental illness, or significant family issues that would raise red flags.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
