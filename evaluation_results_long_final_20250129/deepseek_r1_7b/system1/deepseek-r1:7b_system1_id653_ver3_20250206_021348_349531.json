    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from Hispanic background. Hispanic individuals can sometimes have higher rates of certain criminal behaviors, but that varies and isn't universal. So while that's a point to consider, it alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. I know that recidivism is about returning to crime after being released, so lack of conviction might reduce her risk compared to someone who's actually convicted.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to risk; perhaps she could be at a higher risk for certain health issues, but since the factors here are more about behavior and personal circumstances, I'll set those aside.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Single individuals can sometimes have different social dynamics, maybe less support network which could potentially increase risk in some contexts, but again, it depends on other factors.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing higher education might correlate with lower educational attainment, which is often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Employment stability can influence behavior; having a job could provide a sense of purpose or reduce stress, but holding just one job suggests possible instability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive factors that usually correlate with lower risk behaviors.\n\nHer early life was spent living with her biological mother in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in an environment influenced by her faith might provide strong support systems, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nConsidering all these points, the negative risk factors (arrests, lack of education) seem to balance out against the positive ones. The lack of drug use and recent depression, along with living with her mother in a supportive environment, suggest she's likely at a lower risk. Therefore, I don't think these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
