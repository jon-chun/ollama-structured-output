However, the individual's gender, race, family background, and current living situation offer some mitigating factors that reduce the overall risk prediction somewhat. The confidence in this prediction is rated at 70%.",

She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
