However, the medium rating reflects the typical period of increased risk for young adults.\n  \n- **Gender**: Females have a lower rearrest rate compared to males, hence \"low\" risk.\n\n- **Arrest Count**: Two arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that increases the likelihood of future criminal activity, thus \"high\" risk.\n\n- **Conviction**: Prior convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, which correlates with increased risk, so \"medium\" is assigned.\n\n- **Physical Description**: Physical traits do not provide relevant information about risk factors for recidivism.\n\n- **Marital Status**: Being divorced and living alone might increase social isolation and decrease support systems, potentially increasing her risk.\n\n- **Education Level**: Lack of a high school diploma or GED indicates lower employment opportunities, which could indirectly increase risk due to financial strain or lack of lawful income.\n\n- **Employment History**: No job during the year suggests financial strain or other contributing factors that can lead some individuals to engage in criminal activity.\n\n- **Drug Use**: Abstinence for four years and no use in the past month indicates substance abuse is not a current risk factor.\n\n- **Psychological State**: Feeling down might suggest underlying issues but is not a direct recidivism risk factor.\n\n- **Childhood Home Environment**: Living in a household of 4 in an urban area as a child does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\n\n**Overall Prediction**: Based on the analysis, the prediction is \"YES\" for recidivism within the next three years.\n\n**Confidence**: The confidence in this prediction is 65%, reflecting a slightly above average level of certainty given the mixed indicators present.",

She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is divorced and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
