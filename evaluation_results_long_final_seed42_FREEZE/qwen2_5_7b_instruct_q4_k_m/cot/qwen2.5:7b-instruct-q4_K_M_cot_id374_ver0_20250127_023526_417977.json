Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in a graduate program. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area.
