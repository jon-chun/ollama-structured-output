    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of issue, probably criminal or delinquent behavior. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his late teens doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but it's early adulthood, so maybe not too high risk yet. His race is White; I don't know if that's relevant here unless there are stereotypes, which shouldn't be used without context.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So one arrest, no conviction\u2014this might indicate some criminal history, but only one arrest and a clean record otherwise. Maybe not high risk yet.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 143 lbs. That's within average ranges; nothing jumps out as significantly concerning physical health or anything related to risk assessment.\n\nHe hasn't been married and isn't living alone. So he has a partner, maybe. Living with someone could indicate some level of stability, which is usually positive in risk assessments.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a good indicator; higher education tends to correlate with lower recidivism rates. So this is a positive sign.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests adaptability and life skills, which are usually favorable for delinquency or substance abuse.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014this is very clean behavior. No depression reported over the past month; that's also a good indicator of mental health stability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That might indicate living in an environment where he was exposed to multiple people and perhaps had some form of abuse or neglect, which could be negative but without more info on that, it's hard to say. Urban areas can have different risk profiles compared to rural areas.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life\u2014so a religious affiliation, which is generally positive as it might provide guidance and stability.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, clean record, multiple jobs, good health indicators, living with someone, high school diploma, no drug use. The only negative factor is the past household size, but without knowing if there was abuse or neglect, it's hard to assign much risk from that alone. Since he's 21 and in his prime years, and with positive factors like education, employment history, etc., I wouldn't flag this as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
