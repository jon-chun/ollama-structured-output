    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, arrested twice and convicted. Two convictions are already significant because criminal history can predict future behavior issues or recidivism. \n\nHis height is 5'5\" and weight 155 lbs. No direct info on how this affects risk, but maybe relates to substance use which could be relevant.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse issues he's having.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. This educational gap can sometimes lead to unstable situations or higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some employment history is positive as it shows ability to work and sustain income, which could reduce dependency on substances.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some time in the last month he felt really down and couldn't be cheered up. This suggests ongoing substance abuse issues, which can impair judgment and increase risk of further substance-related problems or criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological father at a young age in a household of four. Family environment could influence behavior; sometimes being raised by multiple family members might lead to dependency issues if he's not getting support from the primary caregiver.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life. This is more of a personal belief, but it can affect his motivation towards positive actions or seeking help.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history (two convictions) and drug use (past four years, recent heavy use) are strong indicators of past issues that could lead to high risk. Additionally, living alone without a support system might exacerbate problems. His educational background also suggests he may not have the resources or support to stay sober or avoid criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it's likely he has a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
