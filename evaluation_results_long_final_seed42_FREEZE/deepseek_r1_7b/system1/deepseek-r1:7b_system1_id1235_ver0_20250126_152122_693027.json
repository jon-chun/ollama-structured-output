    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from a Black background. I know there can be systemic issues in the justice system that affect minority communities, so that might play a role here. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that factor isn't as significant right now.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. That's an important point because being arrested without a conviction doesn't always indicate serious risk; it could be a one-time mistake or misunderstanding of the law. So this might lower his risk level compared to someone with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nHis height and weight aren't too concerning unless there's a health issue associated, but nothing jumps out as directly related here. He's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs; I don't see an immediate link to recidivism based on that information.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because it might indicate he doesn't have close support, but also maybe isolation could lead to more stress or substance use, which isn't directly addressed here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe this indicates he's seeking better opportunities or is stable enough not to drop out. But again, without more info on his education outcomes, it's hard to say how this affects risk.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide financial stability and reduce stress from one source, so that might actually be a protective factor against high risk behavior.\n\nHis substance use history includes marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if it's recent or frequent, can have negative consequences, like impaired judgment or increased risk of other offenses. That could definitely contribute to a higher risk score.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Depression can be linked to substance abuse and self-harm, so not feeling depressed might suggest better mental health, which is protective.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven people in an urban area. Large family households can sometimes lead to different dynamics, maybe more support or stress due to the environment. However, if it's a supportive environment, that could be beneficial. The fact that it's an urban area might mean higher exposure to stressors like crime or poverty.\n\nHis belief about God having no role in his life is something I'm not sure how to interpret. Some people find comfort in religion and spirituality, so lack thereof might lead him towards a more secular lifestyle, which could include risk behaviors if he's not careful.\n\nPutting all this together: He has one arrest, which isn't too bad; he lives alone but without any signs of instability; he has two jobs, some education, and hasn't been convicted. His drug use is recent, though, which could be a red flag. His lack of depression is positive, but his belief in God might not directly affect risk unless it's leading him into risky behaviors.\n\nI think the main concern here is the recent marijuana use. If this is part of a pattern or leads to other issues, it could increase risk. Also, living alone with no support could mean he's more vulnerable to stressors without someone to talk about it.\n\nConsidering all factors, I'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some red flags like drug use and living situation, there aren't enough high-risk indicators that stand out. However, the recent marijuana use is significant enough to maybe bump it up a bit. \n\nSo, maybe around 45% confidence? That seems a bit on the higher side for something like substance abuse but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
