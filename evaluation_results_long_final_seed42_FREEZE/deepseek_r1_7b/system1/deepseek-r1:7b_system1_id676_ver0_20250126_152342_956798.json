    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 21 might be considered relatively young, but since he has been arrested 22 times and convicted, that's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk.\n\nHis race doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues, but in this case, it's more about the other factors. So I'll note his prior convictions as high risk contributing factors.\n\nHe is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless combined with health issues or other factors. No information here that links to physical health, so maybe this doesn't add much to the risk assessment.\n\nNever married and living alone can be associated with higher risk due to potential social support issues, but again, it's context-dependent without more info.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college: Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree could indicate higher risk of reoffending if he tries to get back into education.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year: Employment history can influence risk; having no job might suggest instability but isn't necessarily high risk on its own without other factors indicating instability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of high risk for reoffending and overall behavior issues.\n\nMost of the time during the past month he felt down and couldn't be cheered up: This could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues, both of which are significant contributors to criminal behavior and risk.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area. This suggests he was part of a close family group but doesn\u2019t directly indicate risk unless there's evidence of abuse or neglect from that environment.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life: This could point towards a lack of spiritual support, which might affect behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nPutting all these together, the number of prior convictions (22) is a major red flag. Drug use, unemployment/unstable employment, low self-esteem, and family background are also concerning factors that typically correlate with higher recidivism rates. Each of these contributes to a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
