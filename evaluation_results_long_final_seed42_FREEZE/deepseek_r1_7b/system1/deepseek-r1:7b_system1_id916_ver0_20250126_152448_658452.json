    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might show some previous behavior issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact is less severe.\n\nHe's white, which I know can sometimes be associated with certain outcomes in the justice system, but without more context, it's hard to say how much of an impact that has here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk unless there's something about his physical state or health issues, but he doesn't mention any serious health problems. \n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. That could indicate he might be struggling socially or emotionally, which can sometimes lead to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nHis education is at an associate level; not being enrolled in college might suggest he's facing challenges in his academic or career goals, possibly leading to unstable situations.\n\nHe has two job experiences, so he's employed enough but maybe doesn't have a stable income or career path. \n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse often correlates with higher risk of criminal behavior, including further arrests or more serious offenses.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which might suggest he's managing his substances well or maybe not seeking help when needed.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of four at a young age could indicate family support but also perhaps some challenges like financial strain. His lack of belief in God might be related to substance use and risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nPutting this all together, the drug use seems significant. Even though he hasn't been convicted yet, prior arrest could increase risk factors if it leads to more criminal activity or unstable living situations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
