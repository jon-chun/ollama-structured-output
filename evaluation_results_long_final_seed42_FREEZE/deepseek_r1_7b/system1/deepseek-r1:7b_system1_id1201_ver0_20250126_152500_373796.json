    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual described. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old Black female who has been arrested three times but not convicted. That's a red flag because recidivism is a known predictor of future criminal behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, it might be a bit less severe than someone with a full conviction record.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 162 lbs. I don't know if her weight or height directly relates to risk, but maybe it could indicate if she's in poor health, which might affect her ability to commit crimes. But without more info on that, I shouldn't assume.\n\nNot married and living with someone else who isn't alone\u2014maybe she has support, which usually reduces recidivism rates. So this factor might lower the risk a bit.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Lack of education can lead to substance abuse issues, which could increase risk. Also, substance use (marijuana and cocaine) is linked to higher recidivism rates because it can impair judgment and decision-making.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month but has used drugs. Substance abuse often goes hand in hand with mental health issues, so this might be a contributing factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area\u2014could indicate exposure to family dynamics or environment that might have negative effects on her behavior later on.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe in God affecting her personal life. This could lead to higher rates of risk-taking behaviors since there's no divine guidance to hold her accountable.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest attempts without convictions, substance abuse, lack of education, living with family, and a lack of religious belief. These factors are all known to increase the risk of reoffending. So I would lean towards high risk but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
