    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age isn't typically a strong indicator of risk unless there's something specific about it, but here it's just 20, so probably not significant on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. A single arrest without conviction might indicate some past issues, but since he's not convicted, that's one less point against him.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 10 inches and 169 lbs. This could relate to body type or health issues, but nothing jumps out as directly related to criminal risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a red flag due to lack of supervision, especially if there are underlying issues like mental health problems.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so that might not indicate high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or not having a steady income can be concerning as it might affect his motivation to change behavior.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a significant risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nIn the past month, he felt down and couldn't find comfort. This could indicate depression or low mood, which are serious mental health issues that can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. Shared living conditions from a young age might suggest instability or family dysfunction, which can lead to behavioral issues later on.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal experiences. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, they don't necessarily make someone a risk-taker unless there's evidence of sinfulness or neglect of spiritual responsibilities.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest without conviction, low education, no job, substance use (marijuana), past depression-like feelings, and living with an unstable family. These factors are concerning but not all high-risk indicators. Without a history of violent crime or other strong risk factors like chronic substance abuse beyond marijuana specifically, it's on the lower end of risk.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" with low confidence because while there are some risk signals, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
