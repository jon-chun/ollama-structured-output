    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old White female. Age seems young, so maybe not an immediate red flag unless there's something else indicating she needs help now. Her past is one arrest but no conviction, which might suggest she's aware of her actions and could potentially change behavior if supported.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem to directly relate to risk factors I know about, except maybe for some crimes related to appearance, but she's described as living alone, so perhaps not a concern here. She's never been married and is living alone, which might be a sign of her current situation or independence, but it could also indicate possible isolation leading to stress.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and is in graduate school, which suggests she's educated and potentially stable financially. That's usually a positive indicator for low risk because higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year, so that shows some level of responsibility and economic independence. People who work multiple jobs are generally less likely to be at risk of committing crimes compared to those without income sources.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can sometimes lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors if not properly addressed. It's a bit concerning, but since it's only marijuana and recent feelings of low mood, maybe not severe substance abuse yet.\n\nHer feelings about being down for some time suggests she might be experiencing some level of depression or anxiety. This could impact her ability to make decisions or commit crimes. If she's dealing with mental health issues, she might need support rather than facing harsher penalties alone.\n\nShe was raised in a household of four at a young age in a rural area by both parents. That indicates she has had some form of care and support early on, which is generally protective against criminal behavior compared to children living in neglectful or abusive environments.\n\nHer belief in God suggests a higher level of moral accountability, which could help deter her from certain risky behaviors. If someone feels strongly about their faith, they're often more likely to make responsible choices rather than engage in criminal activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: age is young but not a direct risk factor; no prior conviction despite one arrest; educated background and stable living situation; limited job experience which is positive; some drug use but recent; possible mood issues that could be addressed with support; supportive family background; and a strong moral framework. \n\nI think the overall risk here might be on the lower side, indicating low to moderate risk. The factors don't strongly point towards high risk unless there's something I'm missing. Maybe the recent drug use or mood issues could tip it slightly, but not enough to say definitely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in a graduate program. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
