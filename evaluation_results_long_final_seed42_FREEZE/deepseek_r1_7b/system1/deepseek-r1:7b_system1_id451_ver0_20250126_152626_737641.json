    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female from White background. Age might not be directly indicative of risk unless it's significantly higher or lower than average for her population. Her background as White could influence social network support but doesn't inherently make her at higher risk without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted, which raises some red flags. Convictions can indicate past criminal behavior, which might suggest a risk of reoffending if not properly supervised. But one offense isn't necessarily high risk on its own unless there's a history or other factors.\n\nHeight is 5 feet 8 inches, weight 135 lbs \u2013 seems within normal range and doesn't directly relate to risk unless considering issues like being anemic or having health risks due to weight, but that's not provided here. She's never married and living with someone else\u2014not necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college \u2013 education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates if completed successfully, so this might be protective rather than indicating risk.\n\nEmployed three jobs during the year \u2013 job stability can be a positive indicator as having multiple jobs often means better economic independence. Unemployment or lack of steady work could suggest higher risk, but here she has stable employment history.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without severe consequences might not indicate high risk unless it's a chronic issue. Not feeling depressed is interesting; sometimes substance abuse can lead to mood issues, so this could be a protective factor if she's managing it well.\n\nLiving with her biological mother at age 2 in an urban area \u2013 early experiences can influence personality and behavior. Urban environments might offer different social contexts which aren't necessarily better or worse but could affect support systems. Her belief in God might suggest a sense of personal stability or guidance, which is often protective against certain risks like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: One arrest, no prior severe convictions, stable job history, normal physical stats, not married living with someone else, educated background, and no recent depressed feelings. The factors don't clearly indicate high risk; however, the presence of a prior arrest does suggest some level of risk that might need attention. \n\nConsidering all these points, I'd lean towards moderate risk but without a strong basis for high risk. So, maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
