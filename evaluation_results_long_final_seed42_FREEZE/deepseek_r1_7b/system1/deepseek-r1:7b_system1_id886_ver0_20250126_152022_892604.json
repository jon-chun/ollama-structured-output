    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a Black 21-year-old male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His height is 5'10\", he's never married and living alone. No high school diploma or GED, not in college. Worked one job in the past year. Used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of six in a rural area, and believes God has some role in his life.\n\nFirst, I know that race can influence risk assessment because there are systemic issues like racism in law enforcement and historical mistreatment. Being Black might put him at higher risk based on past studies or data showing minority groups have different arrest rates or re-arrest probabilities.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. In the US, a single arrest doesn't always lead to a conviction, which can affect his chances of getting probation or community supervision. But I'm not sure how much that affects risk prediction compared to other factors.\n\nHis living situation is interesting\u2014he's alone and never married. Being an only child in a large household might have different dynamics, but it's unclear if that directly ties into risk assessment unless there's a history of family issues affecting him.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he might be facing barriers to better opportunities, which can increase unemployment rates and substance use. Not being enrolled in college could mean he has other responsibilities or less access to support systems.\n\nHe held only one job last year. Joblessness for that long can contribute to higher risk of poverty and substance abuse issues, but again, it depends on his support network.\n\nUsing marijuana isn't a serious offense, but frequent drug use can lead to health problems and social issues. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe he's managed it okay or doesn't have severe mental health issues yet.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a rural area at a young age might indicate family instability, which could be linked to higher risk of substance abuse or criminal behavior later on. Rural areas sometimes have different social environments that might not be as protective.\n\nBelieving in God might suggest he has a strong support system from religion, but that can also vary widely and isn't directly tied to risk unless there's evidence of a lack of other support networks.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors don't seem extremely severe on their own, but being Black could increase the base rate. Plus, past issues like living in an unstable household might indicate higher likelihood of certain negative outcomes. So, while not super high, maybe a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
