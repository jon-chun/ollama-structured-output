    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but we'll keep it in mind.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. So only one arrest without a conviction. That might indicate some prior issues that were managed or maybe she's in treatment now.\n\nHer height is 5'10\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. That seems within a normal range, so no indication of being underweight or overweight which could relate to health risks.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Hmm, living with someone else might suggest some level of stability, but it also doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there are other factors like domestic issues or substance abuse that contribute to instability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in graduate school. Education is generally protective against reoffending, so this is a positive factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide financial stability and reduce stress from unemployment, which might be another protective factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes lead to more instability if not managed well, but without recent severe mental health issues, this might not be a significant risk indicator.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents at age 2 when they were in a household of six in an urban area. That's quite a large family setting, which could indicate past family dysfunction or environment that might affect her now.\n\nLastly, she believes in God and thinks it influences her personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and support, but it also doesn't inherently correlate with high risk unless there are other underlying issues like mental health problems tied to religion.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, not convicted; no prior severe mental health issues; stable living situation; positive factors like education and employment. The family history might suggest some past instability, but she's in an urban area which can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates. However, the lack of recent drug use and positive mental state could mitigate that. \n\nConsidering all these points, I don't see a clear high risk indicator here. There are more protective factors than potential issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
