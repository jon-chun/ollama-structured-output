    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice but not convicted. That's two minor offenses maybe? Since he's not convicted, it might not show a lot of serious criminal history yet. But age-wise, 22 isn't too old, so he could still be developing his behavior.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 188 lbs. That seems average or slightly on the higher side. Weight doesn't usually predict much about risk unless there are other factors like substance use.\n\n living alone at this point in time. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to higher risk if he's not connected with his community or support network. But it's just one factor.\n\nHe has no high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates because having an education helps with job opportunities and understanding the system. So this could be a positive indicator, suggesting he might engage less in criminal activities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of income can be risky as it might lead him to turn to other things like drugs or crime for survival. But again, this is a point that suggests potential risk.\n\n drug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't directly linked to high risk unless there's dependence or abuse, which he doesn't mention here. So maybe less of an issue.\n\nHe considers God as something that affects his personal life. That could be a protective factor because religious beliefs often provide guidance and support, reducing the likelihood of negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: He has minor offenses, no significant convictions, average stats, living alone, no education or job, and some religious involvement. These factors seem to lean towards low risk rather than high. I don't see any strong indicators pointing towards high risk here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
