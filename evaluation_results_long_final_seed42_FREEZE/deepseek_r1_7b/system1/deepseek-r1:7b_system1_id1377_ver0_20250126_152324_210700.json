    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm presented with a risk assessment query for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested twice and convicted. She identifies as mixed race, is married living with her spouse, lacks a high school diploma or GED, isn't enrolled in college, has only one job in the past year, used cocaine in the past four years, and feels extremely down during the last month. Additionally, she lived with her biological mother at a young age in an urban household of three.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each risk factor individually. Being arrested twice is significant; recidivism rates among repeat offenders are higher than first-time offenses. The presence of a criminal history is a strong indicator of past behavior that could impact future risk.\n\nHer mixed race heritage might not directly influence her current behavior but could hint at possible socioeconomic background, which often correlates with higher risk levels in some contexts.\n\nMarital status and living with a spouse suggest she's likely to have a stable environment, which can be protective. However, the absence of education (no diploma or GED) points towards lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for positive development.\n\nOnly one job in a year suggests part-time work, possibly indicating low motivation or skills that might not lead to significant career advancement, increasing the risk of unstable income and related issues.\n\nHer drug use (cocaine) in the past four years adds another layer. Cocaine is a harder drug than heroin but still highly addictive. Relapsing after treatment could indicate ongoing struggles with substance abuse, which can affect mental health and self-control.\n\nFeeling extremely down for most of the last month suggests persistent low mood, potentially indicative of depression or other mental health issues. This could impair judgment, decision-making, and ability to form positive relationships, all of which are risky behaviors.\n\nLiving in a household of three with her biological mother at an early age might have influenced her family dynamics. Younger siblings can sometimes lead to neglect or domestic abuse situations, especially if the mother was controlling. Urban living could provide more exposure to stressors like poverty and lack of resources, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nCombining these factors: past criminal history, low education, part-time work, substance use issues, poor mental health, and family background from a young age. These all contribute to high risk indicators such as substance abuse, unstable employment, inadequate educational support, and potential for emotional distress leading to further criminal behavior or involvement in the system.\n\nThe combination of these factors significantly elevates the likelihood of her engaging in risky behaviors again. Therefore, I'm confident that she presents a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
