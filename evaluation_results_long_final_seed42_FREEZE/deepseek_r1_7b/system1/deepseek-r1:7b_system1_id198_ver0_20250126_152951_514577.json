    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who's White. Age 22 might be considered in early adulthood, but without more context on his criminal history beyond being arrested twice and convicted, it's hard to say if that's significant. Being White isn't inherently a risk factor unless there are systemic issues at play.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That does raise some red flags because past criminal behavior can indicate instability or prior risky choices. However, the number of convictions matters; two might not be too bad on their own but could suggest a history that's concerning.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. That's about average for his age, so no immediate health indicators here. Weight isn't a primary risk factor unless it's significantly over or under, which it's not in this case.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk of isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors, but again, without more context on his personal circumstances, it's speculative.\n\nHe has a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in college. Education level usually correlates positively with better job prospects and stability, so this might actually lower the risk. However, not being employed full-time could be concerning if he's relying solely on his studies for income or support.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. That's quite a low number of jobs. If he's been unemployed or underemployed, that can lead to financial instability and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, increase criminal tendencies, and lead to further instability. The fact that he's using them might indicate ongoing issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of depression doesn't necessarily mean no underlying mental health issues, but if he's not experiencing it now, it might suggest he's in better mental health than someone with a history of mental illness.\n\nFamily background: At a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. That's a stable living situation initially, so maybe less concerning unless there were issues within the family that affected him later on.\n\nReligion: He believes God has something to do with his personal events. This might indicate he has some level of control or belief system, but it doesn't directly point to risk factors unless other aspects are considered.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some concerning points like drug use and past arrest history, the presence of education and being enrolled in college somewhat mitigates some of those risks. However, the single job and living situation might be more concerning. The overall risk assessment would weigh these factors against each other. Considering the low number of jobs and possible substance abuse issues, while not the highest risk, it's still on the higher side but not extremely high.\n\nSo, I'd lean towards a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level around 60-70% because there are some significant negatives that point toward higher risk without completely dominating the factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
