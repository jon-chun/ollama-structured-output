    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White descent. Age is usually a minor factor in risk assessment but can sometimes indicate stability or past experiences. Her being convicted once might suggest some past issues, but since it's her first offense, maybe not too bad yet.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 145 lbs, which seems within a normal range for her age. Weight doesn't usually predict risk unless there are other factors like BMI or being underweight/overweight, which isn't the case here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be both a protective factor because she might have fewer stressors from family but also a possible indicator of isolation if she feels lonely or disconnected. She has a GED and isn't in college, which is interesting. People with a high school diploma sometimes don't pursue further education, which could mean they lack skills for better job opportunities, increasing risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs can be beneficial as it shows adaptability and financial stability, so that might actually lower her risk. However, it also depends on how she managed those jobs and if there were any issues during this period.\n\n drug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but most of the time now uses nothing to cheer up during the past month. So, recent abstinence is positive; less likely to be an active drug user which can reduce risk factors related to substance abuse.\n\nShe's had a bad mood for most of the past month, feeling down and not able to get things done. Persistent negative emotions could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues, both of which are associated with higher risk scores in some contexts.\n\nLiving at an early age with her biological father in a household of four in an urban area suggests she may have experienced family stress or neglect. This is a protective factor but sometimes can lead to emotional instability if not properly supported.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal issues, which indicates strong spiritual support and belief. This is generally protective as it provides emotional stability and coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together: While there are some negative factors like substance use in the past and bad moods, she's actively trying to improve, which is a positive sign. The fact that she has multiple jobs and has a GED might suggest better opportunities ahead. However, her past drug use could still pose some risk if it leads to other issues.\n\nI think her overall risk level is moderate but not high. Her positive factors like employment and lack of marriage might offset the negative ones slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
