    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for someone based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 and male, Black. I don't think race plays a direct role in criminal justice risk assessments unless there's historical data showing it correlates with higher crime rates or recidivism, but that might be too broad for this case.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. That alone doesn't seem like a big risk factor since he hasn't actually been punished yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't provide much information on his behavior or habits. 5 feet 10 inches isn't unusual, and weighing 180 lbs is within the normal range for that height.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be a risk factor because someone might be unstable if they're homeless or have other issues, but it depends on other factors too.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities and involvement in the criminal justice system. Not having a degree might limit his options for positive opportunities.\n\nHe's employed two jobs during the year. Having gainful employment is usually considered protective because it suggests he's stable and possibly less likely to engage in illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to harmful behavior or substance abuse disorders that could affect his judgment. However, since he doesn't feel depressed now, maybe it's not as concerning.\n\nHe considers God to have some role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes reduce recidivism rates because they provide moral guidance and support communities. So this might actually be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 13 in an urban area when he was young. Living with the biological family, especially at a younger age, is typically associated with lower risk of criminal behavior compared to those who live with other relatives or no one at all.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. This aligns with having religious beliefs, which usually have protective effects in recidivism assessments.\n\nPutting it all together: No arrests without convictions, not in trouble recently, stable employment, and some factors that might indicate lower risk like living with family and being religiously inclined. The only red flags are past drug use but no recent mental health issues or other risk indicators. Therefore, this person doesn't seem to have high risk factors.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided risk factors does not indicate a high risk. The individual has had limited involvement in the legal system, is stable in employment, and lives with family, which are typically protective factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
