    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, 22 years old, arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions; having multiple convictions can increase recidivism risk because they may have learned poor coping mechanisms or bad habits from previous experiences.\n\nHe is 5'8\" and weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an indicator of certain health issues, without more context about his body fat percentage or other health factors, it's hard to say how much this contributes to risk.\n\nHe's not married and isn't living alone currently. Being in a relationship is generally protective against some risks like substance abuse, so this factor might actually lower the risk slightly.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be linked to lower recidivism rates because education provides skills and opportunities that reduce future criminal tendencies. Not having a diploma might indicate a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences is generally positive as it shows stability and ability to support oneself, but if he's been unemployed or underemployed for too long, that could be a risk factor.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can have both short-term and long-term effects on behavior and mental health.Marijuana might not be as harmful as other drugs like cocaine or alcohol, but it still indicates some substance abuse which is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nNo feeling of depression over the past month. A lack of recent mental health issues could suggest good mental well-being, which is protective against certain risks.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have both protective and negative effects. Urban environments might offer more opportunities but also exposure to negative influences like crime or substance abuse.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal life. Religious affiliation is generally associated with good behavior, so this could be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests and convictions are strong risk factors, indicating he's likely to engage in similar behavior again. His lack of education and current job history might not necessarily add much risk but don't remove it either. The absence of depression is positive, but the other factors lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
