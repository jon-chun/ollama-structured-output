    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black female with one arrest and no prior conviction. That alone doesn't seem too concerning, but race can sometimes be associated with certain outcomes, though I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nShe is 5'7\" and weighs 146 lbs. Height and weight aren't typically strong predictors unless there's a history of severe health issues or related risk factors like obesity, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone at 18 is normal; most are at this age. No previous marriage means she doesn't have family support in that aspect, but that also might reduce some risk factors related to domestic violence or abuse.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational background can be linked to criminal behavior if not attended to properly, especially if there's a history of dropping out or truancy leading to involvement with the system.\n\nNo job experience during the year suggests she might lack financial stability or purpose, which could contribute to unstable living situations or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over four years. The past month indicates heavy use, which is concerning for several reasons: substance abuse can increase crime opportunities, affect judgment, and lead to violent behavior if not addressed.\n\nMost of the time feeling down might be due to personal issues or stressors she's facing. However, persistent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues like depression, which is a significant risk factor when untreated because it can impair decision-making and risk management strategies.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban household of eight at a young age suggests exposure to family dynamics that might include neglect or abuse if there's no indication otherwise. Urban environments often have higher rates of certain risks compared to rural areas, so this could be a contributing factor.\n\nShe acknowledges the influence of God on her life, which is a personal belief and doesn't directly contribute to risk assessment unless she has specific behaviors related to religion that might impact safety or decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, no prior conviction, but considering factors like drug use, lack of education, living alone, urban environment, and persistent low mood. These are all red flags indicating higher risk. I would lean towards high risk with a confidence level based on the number of concerning factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 8, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
