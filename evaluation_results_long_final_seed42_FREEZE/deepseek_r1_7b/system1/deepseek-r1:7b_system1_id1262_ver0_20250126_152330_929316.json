    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment scenario step by step. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male who was arrested once but not convicted. His height and weight are noted, but I'm not sure how those specifics affect risk. He's living alone, never married, no children, which might indicate he's in a stable environment since he doesn't have family support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't pursuing further education or employment yet. That could mean he hasn't developed a stable income source, increasing the risk of dependency issues. He's employed two jobs during the year, so some financial stability there.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive\u2014it shows he's been clean and might have better life choices. No recent depression suggests he's mentally stable, which lowers the risk of substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nHis early life was spent living with his biological father in a household of three in an urban area. That might indicate exposure to some stressors or potential family issues, but since he doesn't relate to God as a belief, it could mean he's proactive and less likely to seek help when needed.\n\nPutting this all together: minimal criminal history (not convicted), stable employment, no drug use, positive mental health, and living alone. The lack of conviction is significant because it might prevent any past negative impacts on his life trajectory. His high school diploma and not being married could mean he's focused on his future without family support.\n\nConsidering all factors, the risk seems low to moderate. He has several positive attributes that mitigate risk, like employment, mental health, and no active substance use. The lack of conviction is a key point because it means he hasn't faced any significant legal consequences beyond his arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
