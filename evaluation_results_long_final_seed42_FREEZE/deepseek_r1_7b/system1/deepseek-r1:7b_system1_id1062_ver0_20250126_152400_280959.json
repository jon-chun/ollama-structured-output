    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, 22 years old, arrested once but not convicted. Generally, race can influence recidivism rates, and being Black might have some associated risks, but since he's only been arrested once and not convicted, that doesn't necessarily mean high risk.\n\nHe is 5'7\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs. That's on the lower end of weight for his height, which could potentially affect his health or behavior, but I'm not sure if that directly translates to a high risk without more context.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to substance use issues or other behavioral problems, but again, I don't know how significant this is in terms of risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future behaviors; not having higher education might mean he's less likely to seek better opportunities, but it doesn't directly indicate risk on its own.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having a job suggests some stability, which is generally positive for reducing recidivism. However, if that job was unstable or he didn't use it as effectively, there could be underlying issues contributing to his current behavior.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use can lead to various behavioral problems, like increased risk of accidents or violence, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's a mitigating factor. However, substance abuse itself is a significant risk factor.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month could indicate some level of mental health, which might be a positive sign against higher risk, but it also depends on his history and other factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area.Living in a large household can sometimes lead to different dynamics, maybe more supervision or exposure to certain environments, but without knowing the family's stability or any issues within that household, it's hard to say how this affects risk.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with his personal events\u2014this suggests he has some level of spirituality or belief in a higher power. This might indicate he's seeking support outside of traditional social systems, which could be either positive or negative depending on the context. If it's providing him with resources, it might help reduce risk; otherwise, it could mean he relies less on societal support structures.\n\nPutting all these together: He has a history that includes some drug use and living in a household with his mother, but also factors like not being convicted, having a job, and being in school. The presence of drug use is concerning, but since he's not depressed recently, it might balance out. His age suggests he's still forming his life experiences, which can be both positive and potentially risky.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk level because while there are some red flags like past drug use, other factors like having a job and being in school might mitigate that risk. However, the combination of these factors isn't strongly indicating high risk either.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
