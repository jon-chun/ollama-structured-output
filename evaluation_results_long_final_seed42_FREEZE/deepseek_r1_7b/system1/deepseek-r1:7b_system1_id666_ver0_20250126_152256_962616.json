    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age 18 might be a minor, but I don't know how that affects risk assessment. Ethnicity alone doesn't usually indicate high risk unless there's a specific reason to think otherwise.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions, especially at such a young age, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. Recidivism is the tendency to reoffend after being released from prison.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. I don't see how physical characteristics contribute much to risk assessment unless it's related to mental health or something, which doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because being with family can provide support, but if he has no income or resources, that might increase risk. However, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which could mean he's unemployed or underemployed. Without income, especially during tough times, someone might be at higher risk of falling into poverty or becoming involved in further criminal activity.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can affect mental health and self-esteem. Substance abuse often correlates with other risk behaviors like theft or violence.\n\nOver the past month, he hasn't felt depressed. While this could be a protective factor if it's consistent, recent lack of depression might indicate he's managing his mental health well, but I'm not sure how significant that is without more context.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. Co-residing with both parents can provide stability and support, which are protective factors. Urban areas might have different social dynamics compared to rural areas, but this doesn't directly indicate risk unless the environment is negative.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it influences his personal events. Religious belief can offer a sense of control and purpose, which could be protective against some risks, especially if it's a strong faith.\n\nPutting all these together: two prior convictions are significant. Age 18 might be a vulnerability point, but the lack of job experience, drug use, and living alone (though maybe with parents) add to the risk factors. The belief in God is positive, so perhaps mitigates some risk, but not enough.\n\nSo overall, considering the prior convictions and negative life circumstances, I think there's a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
