    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is typically a minor factor unless there's something specific about it, but here it seems standard.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That means he hasn't faced the full consequences of his actions. However, even with one arrest, especially if it's a minor offense, that could still be a red flag. It shows some prior involvement in the legal system, which might indicate instability or lack of respect for authority.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 160 lbs. This doesn't seem out of the ordinary; nothing jumps out as significantly concerning physical health or potential issues related to weight.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a sign of instability, especially if someone hasn't formed many social connections yet. It could indicate that he might need support but isn't actively seeking it, which could lead to further isolation.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school suggests he's making an effort to improve his situation, which is positive. Students often have higher chances of success and are more likely to seek help when needed.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. One job usually indicates stability, as someone with multiple jobs might be more established and secure in their income. However, since he's 18, maybe part-time work or school is his main source of income now.\n\nNot using drugs for four years shows a good level of substance use control. That's a positive indicator that he's taking responsibility and not engaging in harmful activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Emotional health is important, and consistently feeling positive without depression could indicate self-worth and resilience.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. That's a large family living together, which might suggest potential issues like neglect or abuse if not properly supervised. It's a concerning factor because such environments are often protective but can also be dangerous depending on the dynamics within.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system and reliance on other sources of faith, which might affect his coping mechanisms for stress or difficult situations.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some concerning factors like living with five family members and his belief in God, the main positives are being enrolled in school, having one job, not using drugs, and no depression. The single arrest is a minor point compared to the overall context of his life. Therefore, even though there are potential red flags, they might not be enough to indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
