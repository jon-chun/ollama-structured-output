    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male from White background. Age is generally considered low, but it can still be a risk factor depending on his behavior and circumstances.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Repeated arrest and conviction are strong indicators of criminal history, which typically correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet tall and 180 lbs. Not sure if height or weight alone indicate much without more context on his behavior.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can be a risk factor for various issues like substance abuse or instability, but it depends on other factors too.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe indicates some level of education but could also suggest he's looking to improve his situation by returning to school.\n\nHe's held seven jobs during the year. Having multiple job histories can sometimes indicate resilience or past instability, but it's not always a direct risk indicator unless there were issues with employment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some use might be permissible, especially marijuana which is less severe than cocaine, but repeated substance use can increase risk of addiction and related issues.\n\nHe felt so down in the dumps for much of the past month. Emotional distress or low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors contributing to his behavior.\n\nAt a young age (19) he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. Younger age can be a risk factor due to instability, lack of mature decision-making, and exposure to multiple people who might influence him negatively.\n\nLastly, he believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or spiritual guidance which some studies suggest can affect behavior but doesn't directly correlate with criminality unless combined with other factors like substance abuse.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple arrests (3), drug use (marijuana and cocaine), emotional distress, living in a large household as a child, and potential lack of religious support. These are all significant risk indicators. While he is young, the other factors point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
