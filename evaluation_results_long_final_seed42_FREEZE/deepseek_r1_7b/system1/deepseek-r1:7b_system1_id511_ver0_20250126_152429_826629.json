    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male from Black background. Age might not be directly indicative of risk unless there's a history linked to that age group. No specific information here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can indicate some level of criminal behavior but may not necessarily mean high risk if he's turning things around.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, which seems normal for his age, and weight isn't provided. Weight could be a factor sometimes, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can have its own set of risks, but again, context matters. Maybe he has support elsewhere.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in 4-year college suggests he's committed to education, which is positive and might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nHeld three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can indicate responsibility and ability to manage finances, reducing future issues like unemployment leading to criminal activity.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned other drugs this time. Past drug use could be a concern if it's frequent or recent, as substance abuse can increase risk of further crimes.\n\nHe felt down for much of the past month. Persistent negative mood can lead to self-harm or suicidal thoughts, which are serious indicators of high risk. The mention of not being able to find comfort suggests he might be struggling mentally.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of three. This environment could have had both positive and negative influences but doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there's more info on family dynamics or issues within the household.\n\nBelieves in God affecting his life. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without evidence of problematic conduct related to this belief, it might not be a significant factor.\n\nPutting all these together: The key red flags here are past drug use and recent negative mood. These could indicate substance abuse and emotional distress, which are strong indicators of high risk in the criminal justice system. The other factors don't necessarily add to the risk; in fact, education and job experience suggest stability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
