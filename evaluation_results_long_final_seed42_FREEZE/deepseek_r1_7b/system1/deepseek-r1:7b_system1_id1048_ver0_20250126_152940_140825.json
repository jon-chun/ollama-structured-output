    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times and convicted. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of problematic behavior. That's definitely a red flag.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic, which doesn't directly contribute to risk but might be relevant for other considerations like community issues or potential biases.\n\nHis height is 5'5\" and weight 145 lbs. Not sure if that affects risk assessment unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNot married and living alone could mean he's going through some personal challenges, possibly affecting his stability but not directly indicating high risk on its own.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive sign as education can lead to better opportunities, reducing recidivism risk. However, he hasn't held any jobs during the year, which might be due to unemployment or lack of motivation, but again, school enrollment mitigates that.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and had a bad mood for part of the month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area could indicate family instability, which might affect his behavior or substance use. However, without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to gauge its impact on risk.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life might suggest a lack of spiritual guidance, which can be a source of stress and may lead him towards risky behaviors like drug use if not addressed.\n\nPutting this all together: Multiple arrests (6), substance abuse (marijuana, cocaine), living with family (size 4), and lack of spiritual support. These factors are consistently pointing towards high risk. The confidence level is quite high due to the multiple arrest records and ongoing substance issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
