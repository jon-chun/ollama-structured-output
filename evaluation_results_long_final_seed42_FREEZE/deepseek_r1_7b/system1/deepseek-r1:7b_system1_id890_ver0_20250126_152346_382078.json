    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age isn't directly concerning unless it suggests immaturity or vulnerability, but she has two prior convictions and is currently convicted. That raises concerns about past criminal behavior which can affect her risk now.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Her weight could be a factor in terms of physical health, but without more info on BMI or related health issues, it might not be significant here.\n\nLiving alone indicates she's an independent individual, which might suggest lower risk of dependency issues, unless there are other factors at play.\n\nShe has a high school education and isn't enrolled in college. Educational status can sometimes correlate with job opportunities and substance use, but this alone doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs usually suggests stability, which is positive for risk assessment unless there's inconsistency or instability elsewhere.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some recent use (last month) indicates ongoing substance issues. Substance abuse can be a significant risk factor when it leads to impaired judgment or behavior.\n\nFeeling down for extended periods suggests possible depression or emotional instability, which are serious mental health concerns that could impact decision-making and risk behaviors.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area might have provided certain experiences but doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there's evidence of abuse or neglect. The mention of God playing a role suggests she has some spirituality, which might influence behavior but isn't necessarily linked to high risk.\n\nPutting this all together: She has past criminal history, drug use, emotional issues, and living in a multi-person household without clear evidence of adverse conditions. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has completed study at an associate/junior college and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
