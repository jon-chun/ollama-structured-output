    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female Hispanic woman who has been arrested four times and convicted. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's young at 21 but has a criminal history. Young adults often have more impulsive behavior, which can be risky. Her Hispanic identity might influence her experiences with the justice system, possibly leading to higher recidivism rates compared to other groups.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and convicted. That's significant because each conviction adds to her risk profile. Recidivism is a major indicator of high risk, so this alone points towards \"YES.\"\n\nHer height and weight (5'4\"/180 lbs) don't seem directly relevant here unless there's an association with health issues, but that's not indicated.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect support systems, which might influence her ability to seek help or avoid risky situations, but it doesn't immediately indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college suggests she has some education but isn't pursuing further learning, which could mean she relies on job skills from her past work, but that's speculative without more context.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Job experience can be a double-edged sword; it shows adaptability but might also indicate financial stability if stable. Without info on earnings or instability, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of behavioral issues that could lead to further criminal behavior, making her a high-risk individual.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood for much of the month could indicate substance abuse issues or mental health problems. Both can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with six people in her household. That's a large family, which might suggest past family dynamics affecting her independence or ability to make decisions on her own.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of spirituality, which could provide support but also might influence her decision-making if she feels her faith can override rational choices.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest convictions, drug use, low mood, and a young age with family living situation. These factors strongly suggest high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
