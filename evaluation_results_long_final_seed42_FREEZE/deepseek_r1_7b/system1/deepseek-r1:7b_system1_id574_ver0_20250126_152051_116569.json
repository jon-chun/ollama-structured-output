    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old White female with one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too concerning yet. Her height and weight don't seem out of the ordinary; maybe relevant for some assessments, but I'm focusing on other factors here.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it also depends on her support system. Since she doesn't have a partner, that could be a red flag in terms of potential substance use or isolation issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this isn't a strong risk factor.\n\nNot working during the year might indicate she's struggling financially. Unemployment can contribute to other negative behaviors, but without more info on how it's affecting her, I should be cautious.\n\nDrug use history: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse is a known risk factor for various issues like accidents, criminal behavior, etc.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not feeling down might seem positive, it could also mask underlying mental health issues that aren't being addressed.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother at a young age suggests she might have been exposed to certain environments or potential stressors early on. That's something to consider but isn't directly a risk indicator without more context.\n\nShe mentions believing in God, which is a positive factor, often associated with higher moral standards and poorer substance use rates.\n\nPutting this all together: The drug use history seems like the most significant red flag here. Even though she has no prior convictions and good education, her recent substance abuse could increase risk for things like accidents, illegal activities, or further criminal behavior. Her lack of employment also might make her vulnerable to other risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
