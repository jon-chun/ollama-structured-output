    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male of Asian/Pacific Islander descent. His age might be relevant because younger individuals sometimes have different risk profiles compared to older adults. However, age alone isn't a strong indicator unless there's a history of criminal behavior associated with age.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can indicate some level of risk because they show contact with the judicial system and past legal issues. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe this suggests that any previous issues were resolved without serious penalties.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 160 lbs. This doesn't seem directly related to risk unless there's an association with physical health factors like heart disease or other conditions, but I don't see any information on that here.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and hasn't held a job during the year. Lack of employment can be a red flag because unemployment is often linked to higher recidivism rates. Not having a job might mean he's struggling with income maintenance or facing other personal challenges.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. Education level can impact risk factors; while some studies suggest that higher education may reduce recidivism, not completing high school sometimes indicates instability which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use isn't always a strong indicator unless it's a controlled substance or if there are behavioral issues like depression, anxiety, etc. Marijuana is generally considered mild compared to others, so maybe not as significant here.\n\nAt a young age (22), he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. This could indicate family stability or instability depending on the context. Urban areas might have different social dynamics compared to rural areas. Living with both parents at such a young age doesn't necessarily predict future issues unless there were disciplinary problems.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior and risk-taking, but without more information on how this belief specifically affects his actions or decisions, it's hard to assess as a risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: One arrest, no prior conviction, living alone, no job, high school diploma, recent drug use (marijuana), not feeling depressed. The person is 22, which might be in a phase of life where he's exploring options but hasn't faced significant challenges yet. The lack of employment and no family issues don't immediately point to high risk without more context on any underlying issues or support systems.\n\nTherefore, I would lean towards a low confidence level indicating not high risk. Maybe around 25% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
