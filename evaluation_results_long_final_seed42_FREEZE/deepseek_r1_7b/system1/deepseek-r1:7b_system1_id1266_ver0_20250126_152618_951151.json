    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female of Hispanic descent. She's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That means she might have some criminal history, which can be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. I don't know if that weight is problematic, but it's not immediately obvious as an indicator of risk without more context on her lifestyle or health issues.\n\nShe's living alone, which could be a sign of instability or potential isolation leading to emotional distress. She hasn't been married and is currently single, so maybe she's going through some personal challenges that affect her mental state.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and doesn't have a GED, nor is she enrolled in college. This educational gap might leave her with limited opportunities, which can contribute to substance abuse or unstable living situations.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Employment can provide stability, so having no active job could indicate financial strain or lack of support system.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Additionally, she feels down for most of the month, which might be linked to substance abuse or mental health issues. This is a significant risk factor because drug use can impair judgment and lead to further problems like criminal behavior.\n\nShe experienced tough living conditions at a young age when both her parents were present in a household of six in an urban area. That's a concerning situation that could have long-term effects on her mental health and ability to form stable relationships.\n\nLastly, she believes God is involved in her life, which might suggest strong spiritual support. However, this can sometimes be used as a barrier against seeking help for substance abuse or other issues.\n\nPutting all these together: The arrest history (even if not convicted), drug use, lack of education and employment, living alone, and emotional distress from a challenging upbringing all contribute to high risk factors. These points suggest she's at higher risk for future criminal behavior or substance abuse issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
