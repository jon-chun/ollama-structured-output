    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factor profile for high risk using the given data points. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, age 22, arrested twice and convicted. That's two convictions at such an early age\u2014it might indicate prior criminal behavior which could be a red flag.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight within that range isn't necessarily high risk on its own, but it's something to consider along with other factors.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which can sometimes be an indicator of possible issues like substance abuse or lack of support system.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational barriers might lead him into situations where he can't take responsibility for his choices, maybe leading to more risky behavior.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year; having some income might reduce dependency on illegal activities but could also have other implications depending on the nature of work.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some recent use within the last month is concerning because drug use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and lead to instability.\n\nMental health symptoms: feeling down for most of the time and sometimes so low that nothing cheers him up. This could indicate depression or a mood disorder which might affect his decision-making abilities.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of four. That's a strong family background, but it doesn't directly relate to risk unless there are issues within the family environment contributing to his behavior.\n\nReligious involvement: considers God as something affecting his personal life\u2014could be protective or might indicate underlying mental health issues if he's struggling with faith and meaning.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple factors point towards high risk. The recency of drug use, the emotional state indicating potential mental health issues, early convictions which may signal past problematic behavior, and being in a family home could contribute to instability. His lack of education might also make him more vulnerable to further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThe risk factors indicate high risk with an 85% confidence level.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age and Convictions:** The individual is 22 years old with two prior arrests and convictions, suggesting early exposure to criminal behavior which could be a significant indicator of higher risk.\n\n2. **Drug Use:** Recurrent use of marijuana and cocaine, especially in the past month, points towards potential substance abuse issues, which are typically associated with higher risk behaviors.\n\n3. **Mental Health Symptoms:** Persistent feelings of depression or low mood can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the likelihood of risky decisions.\n\n4. **Family Background:** Living alone at a young age without a stable family support system may contribute to instability and risky behavior.\n\n5. **Education Level:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED combined with not pursuing college despite holding two jobs\u2014this could indicate potential vulnerability in areas like substance abuse or employment stability.\n\n6. **Recall of Prior Convictions:** The individual's history of arrests at such an early stage suggests past problematic behavior that might continue to affect their current risk profile.\n\nConsidering these factors together, the overall risk assessment leans towards high risk with moderate confidence.\n```",
