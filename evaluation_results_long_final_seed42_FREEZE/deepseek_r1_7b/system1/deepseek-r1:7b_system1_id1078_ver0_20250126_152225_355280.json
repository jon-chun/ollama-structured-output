    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk based on the given criteria.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who's Black. Arrested 10 times and convicted\u2014so he has a history of multiple convictions. That already seems concerning because having multiple arrest records can be a strong indicator of past issues which might affect his future behavior.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 180 lbs, but I don't think height or weight alone contribute much to risk assessment unless it's related to other factors like BMI for obesity. He's never married and living alone\u2014maybe living alone could be a sign of instability, but that depends on the surrounding circumstances.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not completing education can lead to various challenges in life, which might contribute to higher risk factors like substance abuse or unstable relationships.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year\u2014joblessness is often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior or substance use because he has fewer opportunities for positive engagement.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and didn't feel depressed last month. Drug use can be a sign of underlying issues, but without more info on other drug uses or withdrawal effects, it's hard to say definitively. Not feeling depressed might indicate some coping mechanism but isn't directly linked to high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That could imply exposure to certain environments which might influence his behavior or mental health. Urban areas often have higher rates of crime and substance abuse, so that's something to consider.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life\u2014this could be a sign of spirituality issues or a lack of guidance, which might lead him towards riskier choices if not supported properly.\n\nPutting all this together, the multiple arrests, education issues, living alone, and past drug use, along with his belief system, suggest he's at high risk. I'd lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
