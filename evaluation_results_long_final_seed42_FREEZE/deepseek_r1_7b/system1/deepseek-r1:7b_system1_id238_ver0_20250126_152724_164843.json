    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Race can be a factor in risk assessments, but it's important not to overgeneralize. However, without specific data on crime rates or arrest patterns among different racial groups, I'll note this as something to consider.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't typically indicate high risk unless there are prior convictions, which aren't the case here. So, this might not be a significant factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch. While physical characteristics can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or environments, without additional context like where he lives or what jobs he has, this doesn't directly indicate risk.\n\nHe's living alone and is currently single. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk for substance abuse or domestic violence, but since he's never been married and isn't in a relationship, this might not be a major indicator here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates when higher education is available as an option. This factor suggests he may need support, which could positively influence his risk assessment.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can contribute to dependency issues, such as substance abuse or lack of stability, but having at least some employment might provide a sense of purpose and reduce risk factors like street involvement.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana) in the past four years, with recent use in the last month leading him to feel down. Substance abuse can significantly increase the risk of criminal behavior, especially if it's causing distress or affecting his ability to function in daily life.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of eight people. Large households are often associated with higher rates of substance abuse and criminal behavior due to environmental factors like lack of supervision or increased exposure to negative influences.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has some influence over his life. Religious beliefs can affect risk-taking behaviors, but without knowing the strength of this belief or other personal factors, it's hard to gauge its impact on risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple risk indicators are present\u2014past drug use, living in a large household, limited education, and being young with a history of arrests. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
