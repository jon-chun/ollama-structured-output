    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of outcome\u2014probably criminal recidivism based on the context given. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 22 years old and identified as White. Age 22 is relatively young, which might not be a strong indicator on its own. Being White doesn't inherently make someone more or less likely to recommit crimes; it's more about the specific circumstances.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So she has a criminal history, but only one arrest without a conviction. That could be significant because even one non-convicted arrest can sometimes signal underlying issues that might lead to future offenses. But not all arrests are necessarily predictive of recidivism.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 130 lbs. These don't seem particularly relevant on their own. Weight categories can sometimes be associated with risk, but since she's underweight at 130 lbs (assuming average BMI), maybe not a major factor here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone is generally linked to higher recidivism rates because there are fewer people to help if something goes wrong. She might face isolation or stress that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. People with more education often have better job opportunities, which can reduce the incentive to commit crimes. Being in college suggests she's motivated towards positive outcomes.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment history is another protective factor because having steady income can help maintain sobriety or financial stability, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest she's maintaining a stable lifestyle without substance abuse or mental health issues that could contribute to crime.\n\nShe lived with non-biological parents at age 5 in an urban area for three people. Growing up in an environment where she wasn't with her biological family can sometimes be protective against certain types of abuse, but it might also present challenges like limited support systems or exposure to other influences.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, potentially leading to more prosaic behaviors rather than violent ones, though they don't guarantee better outcomes.\n\nPutting this all together: one non-convicted arrest isn't a huge red flag, but several factors like living alone, not being convicted despite an arrest, and some background issues might increase the risk. However, her education, employment, lack of drug use, and positive mental health are strong protective factors that could lower the risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some risk factors, they're outweighed by protective ones. So maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
