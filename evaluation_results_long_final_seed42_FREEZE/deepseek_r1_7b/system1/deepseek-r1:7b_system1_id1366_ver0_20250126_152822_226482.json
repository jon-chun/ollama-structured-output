    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't see any immediate racial biases in the risk factors given, unless there are stereotypes involved, but without more context, I can't assume that. So maybe not a strong indicator here.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. One offense doesn't usually indicate high risk on its own, especially since she's young and has since completed her sentence. But recidivism rates for first-time offenders vary by age; younger individuals tend to have lower recidivism rates.\n\nHer demographics: 5'4\", 125-149 lbs, living alone as a single parent? Wait, she hasn't been married yet, so maybe she's in a co-parenting situation or raising herself. That might be an indicator of her stability, which could lower risk rather than raise it.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment: She has some education, which is generally associated with better job opportunities and lower likelihood of involvement in the criminal justice system again. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs in a year. Having multiple jobs suggests good financial stability and possibly higher life skills or greater responsibility. More employment often reduces recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent or if she still uses occasionally. However, if she's not experiencing negative consequences now (like depression), maybe that lowers the immediate risk.\n\nLiving alone without a family might mean she's more responsible with her own safety and daily living. No partner mentioned either; she's been single for some time, so that could be a sign of stability or perhaps independence.\n\nYoung age: 21 is still quite young, but since she has a high school diploma, it's possible she's attending college now. Younger individuals sometimes have different life choices and may not face the same challenges as older adults.\n\nBelieving in God: A religious belief can provide personal safety net or coping mechanisms for stress, which might influence her risk behavior. It could either help her stay out of trouble or keep her grounded if she's having a crisis.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like past drug use and living alone, but also several protective factors like education, stable employment history, and age. The recidivism rate for someone with these factors is likely low. Her drug use in the past might be a concern, but since she's not currently experiencing negative emotions, that could indicate she's managed it well.\n\nConsidering all this, I think her risk of reoffending is relatively low. So my prediction would be \"NO\" with high confidence because the protective factors outweigh the minor risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
