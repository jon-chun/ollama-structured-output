    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk using my knowledge as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. His race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless there's a historical context or data suggesting otherwise, but generally, it might not be significant enough on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which can indicate some level of criminal history, but since he's only been convicted once, it's probably not a huge red flag yet.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 128 lbs. This might be relevant for other factors like physical risk or health indicators, but in this case, there's no mention of health issues beyond drug use.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk because there are fewer people to support them if something goes wrong, but it's not a definitive factor without more context.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is generally considered protective unless there's evidence that low education leads directly to criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't completed higher education, maybe there are underlying issues? Not sure yet.\n\nHe has held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can indicate stability, which might be a protective factor, but it could also mean he has tried various paths without much success.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically\u2014and no recent depression over the past month. Drug use is concerning because even if he hasn't felt depressed recently, prior drug use can affect judgment and behavior. Marijuana might be less harmful than other drugs but still indicates some risk-taking.\n\nHe lived at a young age with both biological parents in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment could have various implications\u2014family support, exposure to certain values, or potential neglect issues if not all is well. Being in a rural area might offer less supervision compared to urban areas.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it influences his personal events. This religious belief can sometimes correlate with more prosocial behaviors, but it's also possible for people to have strong faith without making better life choices.\n\nPutting this all together: one prior conviction, no college education, a relatively low weight (128 lbs), height 5'7\", living alone, past drug use, and some family background. The one conviction might be the strongest indicator here. It's not high risk yet because it's only once, but other factors like substance use could add to the risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level since there are no clear warning signs beyond the one prior offense. Maybe around 30-40% confidence?\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
