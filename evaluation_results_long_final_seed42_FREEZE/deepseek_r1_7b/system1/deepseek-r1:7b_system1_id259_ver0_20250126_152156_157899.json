    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 20 might be considered at-risk age, but without knowing the context of his criminal history or behavior, it's hard to say. He has been arrested once and convicted, which does suggest some risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5 feet 9 inches and 160 lbs. That doesn't immediately indicate a high risk on its own, unless combined with other factors. He's never married and living alone, which might be more about lifestyle than risk. High school diploma and not college enrolled \u2013 maybe indicating some level of stability but also perhaps lower motivation to change.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could mean he's unemployed or underemployed, potentially leading him to engage in risky behaviors as a result. Not using drugs for four years is a positive indicator, so that might lower risk. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month \u2013 if he's stable mentally, this isn't concerning.\n\nHe lived with his biological father when he was young in a household of three, which could imply some family issues or environment, but again, without more context, it's hard to assess. His belief in God might suggest a higher level of personal responsibility and moral compass.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some concerning factors like prior arrest and not being employed, the positive indicators like no drug use and recent mental stability are strong. The age at 20 is also a consideration but without more background, it's hard to definitively label him as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
