    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for something\u2014maybe criminal reoffending or something else. The person is a 21-year-old female of White descent. She's been arrested nine times and convicted once. That's a lot of prior convictions; each arrest increases the risk.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and 105 lbs, which might indicate she's underweight. But I don't know how that affects her risk. Her marital status is single and currently not living alone\u2014maybe living with others could provide stability but also might suggest some vulnerability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college now. Maybe she's looking for more education, which sometimes can be a positive step towards better opportunities, but if she's not engaged socially, it might have negative implications.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. That seems like minimal employment history\u2014maybe indicating job instability or lack of career focus, which could be risky in terms of job loss affecting her overall stability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both short-term and long-term effects on behavior and relationships, so even a recent absence might not indicate a clean slate.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her personal life could suggest some level of spirituality or lack thereof, which might be related to her outlook on life\u2014maybe affecting her motivation or positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are significant. The single status and living arrangement don't immediately ring alarm bells but add up over time. Her employment history is minimal, which can lead to instability. Drug use without depression could have behavioral impacts. Her personal beliefs might influence her behavior in ways that aren't directly observable here.\n\nConsidering the number of prior offenses\u20149\u2014if she's been convicted multiple times for serious crimes, that's a strong indicator of high risk. The other factors are more neutral or mixed but don't outweigh the prior convictions and lack of stable living conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
