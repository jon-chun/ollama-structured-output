    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment analysis step by step. The person is a 20-year-old Black female with one prior arrest and a conviction. She's described as having low risk factors like being unmarried, living alone, educated, and relatively stable job history. However, her past drug use (marijuana) might indicate some substance abuse which could be a red flag.\n\nHer background is concerning because she lived in a household of three with her biological mother in a rural area at a young age. This suggests possible domestic issues or family instability that could affect her behavior and future stability.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of any criminal history, despite being a first-time offender, raises some concern. The drug use is another point to consider as substance abuse can sometimes be linked with higher recidivism rates. Additionally, living in a family environment might have left her with behavioral or emotional challenges that could impact her risk level.\n\nGiven these points, the risk isn't extremely high but definitely on the moderate side. Therefore, I would rate this individual's risk as moderately high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
