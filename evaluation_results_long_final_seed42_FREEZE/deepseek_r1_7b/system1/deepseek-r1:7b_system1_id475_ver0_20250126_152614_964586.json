    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual mentioned. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age-wise, being in her twenties is generally considered relatively young and not necessarily a high-risk group unless there are other factors. Her ethnicity doesn't immediately raise red flags either; however, it's something to consider if we're looking at systemic issues.\n\nShe's been arrested two times but hasn't been convicted. So, she has a criminal history but it might be expunged or not impactful enough yet. Not being convicted could mean her current behavior is more controlled and less risky compared to someone with a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 180 lbs. No extreme physical characteristics that would typically be associated with higher risk, unless there's an underlying health issue, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability from a relationship can indicate lower risk because it often correlates with having a support system and better decision-making skills. Marital status is usually considered protective in most risk assessments.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school is a positive indicator as it shows some level of education which, when combined with job experience, can be beneficial. Not going to college might mean she's focused on work or other responsibilities, reducing her chances of further involvement in risky behavior.\n\nShe has held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences typically indicates good work history and responsibility. It suggests she's adaptable and has a solid foundation for financial stability, which can lower risk factors.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use is concerning on its own, not feeling depressed might suggest she's managing her substance use effectively or doesn't have an underlying mental health issue that would escalate risk.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents at a young age in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in a stable, multi-parent household can be protective against various risks such as abuse or neglect. Urban living might offer more opportunities for positive influences compared to rural areas.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has a strong religious foundation and mental health support system. This can provide stability and guidance, which are usually associated with lower risk of problematic behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: She's young, not convicted, stable due to marriage and family, education-wise positive (high school), job experience, manageable drug use without recent issues, and a supportive religious background. These factors generally indicate lower risk compared to someone with more significant criminal history or negative life circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
