    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. The person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested once but not convicted. His height and weight don't raise any immediate red flags. He's single and living alone, which might be concerning in terms of social support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't attending college, maybe indicating some level of stability or perhaps lack of motivation for further education. He's employed one job during the year, so income is present but could vary depending on industry.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression suggests he's in good mental health. His background shows living with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area; that might have some social or emotional implications, but not necessarily directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHis religious involvement is positive, which can contribute to personal stability. Overall, the factors seem mixed\u2014no clear high-risk indicators like multiple arrests, substance abuse, or unstable living conditions. So, I don't see a strong basis for considering him a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
