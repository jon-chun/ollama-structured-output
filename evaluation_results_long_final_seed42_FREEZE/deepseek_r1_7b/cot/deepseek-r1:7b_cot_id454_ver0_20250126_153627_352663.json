    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22, which is relatively young but still in her prime years of potential for higher crime rates. She has two prior arrests and a conviction, so that\u2019s a significant factor\u2014higher risk because recidivism tends to increase with more convictions.\n\nHer race is White, which might be less predictive compared to other factors since socioeconomic and environmental influences are often more impactful. She's currently living alone, which can lead to higher stress and lower social support, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. While education can reduce recidivism, being still in school might mean she's not fully committed or motivated, so that could be a medium factor.\n\nOnly one job during the year\u2014work experience can contribute positively if it leads to financial stability or skills transfer, but with limited time spent, maybe her employability is average, hence low risk from this angle.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only) might suggest she's aware of substance issues. However, since she hasn't felt depressed recently, that might indicate she's managed it, so perhaps lower risk here.\n\nShe experienced adverse childhood conditions\u2014living with five adults in an urban area at a young age\u2014that's definitely high risk because exposure to trauma and unstable environments are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHer religious affiliation is positive, which can aid in personal motivation towards good behavior. However, her past drug use might counteract that slightly, but overall, it's still a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrests and convictions push her into medium to high risk. Unstable living situation adds significantly, especially combined with possible drug use issues. Education is present but not strong enough to offset the negatives. Being young but having two prior offenses might balance out at medium risk.\n\nSo, overall prediction would be medium risk because of multiple factors that increase recidivism despite some mitigating influences like her education and religion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Her two prior arrests and one conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior which is a significant factor in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living\", \"high\", \"Living alone with no support network increases stress, lowering social capital, which are strong predictors of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"While she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, limited time spent working may indicate lower employability or motivation for change.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Only one job during the year might suggest limited financial stability or skills transfer to criminal activities but not necessarily a strong positive factor.\"),\n    (\"adverse Childhood\", \"high\", \"Living with five adults in an urban area at a young age and experiencing such conditions significantly increases recidivism risk due to trauma exposure.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"While her religious affiliation is present, the recent lack of depression might suggest some coping mechanism but still contributes positively to behavior change.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) indicates awareness and potential motivation towards change, mitigating risk slightly but not entirely removing it.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
