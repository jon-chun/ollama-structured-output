    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like education or past behavior. So maybe that's low risk.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a mitigating factor because convictions are more impactful. So probably low here too.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly related, so I'll just note them as neutral.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014does that affect her likelihood of reoffending? Not sure, maybe medium risk if she's unstable, but not certain.\n\nHigh school diploma in grad school\u2014it might show some commitment, which could lower the risk. So low weight.\n\nShe has three jobs in a year\u2014having steady income is usually positive for recidivism. Maybe low or medium?\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine past four years. That's concerning because drug use can lead to more criminal behavior. High risk here since she's still using, even if not feeling depressed recently.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might indicate some mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism factors like substance abuse or unstable living situations. So maybe medium weight.\n\nChildhood home: lived with both parents in a household of six, urban area. That sounds stressful but maybe she's adjusted well. Not sure how this affects her now though; perhaps low risk because she was in a stable environment as a child?\n\nBelieves in God\u2014could be a positive factor for personal motivation or moral guidance, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use seems to have the most significant impact with high risk weight. Other factors are mixed but don't outweigh that. So overall prediction is high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Her race is White, which typically does not significantly influence recidivism rates compared to other factors like education or past behavior.\"),\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which might be a mitigating factor as convictions are more impactful in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_weight\", \"neutral\", \"Her age (22) and weight range do not directly relate to recidivism risk but should not be disregarded completely.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and not living alone could indicate potential instability, which might contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_graduate_school\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in graduate school, showing educational commitment that could positively influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs during the year shows steady income potential, which might slightly mitigate recidivism risk but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor as substance use can lead to criminal behavior and contributes directly to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month might indicate some mental health concerns that could contribute indirectly to recidivism risk through factors like substance abuse or instability.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area suggests she was in a stable environment as a child, which might positively influence her current risk profile.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God could provide personal motivation and moral guidance but should not be seen as a direct mitigating factor for recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
