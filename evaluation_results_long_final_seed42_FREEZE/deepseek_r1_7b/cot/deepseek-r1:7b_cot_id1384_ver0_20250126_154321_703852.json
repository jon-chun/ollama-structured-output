    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with two arrests but no convictions. That's concerning because even though she hasn't been convicted, it shows past behavior that might indicate a tendency towards reoffending.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 140 lbs. Her body type alone doesn't directly correlate to risk, but combined with other factors like drug use and living situation, it could be relevant.\n\nMarried and living with her spouse is a positive factor because she has support from home, which can aid in stability and decision-making.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Education plays a role; individuals without formal education might face barriers to better opportunities, contributing to recidivism.\n\nOnly holding one job during the year suggests limited income stability. Joblessness can lead to financial stressors that increase the risk of engaging in criminal activities again.\n\nDrug use history, particularly marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, is a red flag. Substance abuse often correlates with higher rates of reoffending due to addiction reinforcing negative choices.\n\nShe felt down for much of the past month without any source of cheer. Emotional distress can lead to self-harm or substance use, which are precursors to more severe criminal behavior.\n\nLiving at a young age in a household of three in a rural area with her biological mother might indicate family dynamics that could either support or hinder her well-being. It's possible she experienced neglect or abuse, which can contribute to risk factors.\n\nHer religious belief in God suggests a potential for strong moral guidance, which could mitigate some risk factors. However, it also means she may lack alternative coping mechanisms if things go wrong.\n\nPutting all these together: two arrests, no education, unemployment duration of one year, drug use, emotional distress, and a brief family background that might have issues. These factors collectively increase the risk but aren't all high. I'd lean towards medium to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history (2 arrests, no convictions)\", \"medium\", \"The presence of two arrests, even without convictions, suggests a past behavior that could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.
