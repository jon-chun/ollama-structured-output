I don't know if race plays a significant role in recidivism beyond systemic issues which aren't fully captured here. Maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest but not a conviction. That's minor compared to someone with a full conviction, so maybe medium.\n\nHis height and weight probably don't affect recidivism directly. So another medium factor.\n\nNot married and living alone might indicate he's less stable, which could be medium risk.\n\nLacks a high school diploma or GED\u2014this is a big red flag for future involvement in the system. High risk because education is key to avoiding further issues.\n\nHe's employed 3 jobs, but not college, so maybe some stability from work but low confidence since getting a job doesn't guarantee better outcomes if he's in trouble again.\n\nDrug use history of marijuana and cocaine could be high risk, especially if it affects his mental state negatively. High weight here.\n\nYouth living with his dad in a household of 3\u2014family environment can impact behavior; maybe medium but not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life\u2014that might indicate a lack of spirituality or moral support, which could be low risk if that's all he relies on, but it's hard to say. Maybe low.\n\nPutting this together: education is the highest risk factor, followed by drug use and past unstable family environment. The rest are medium or lower. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which may indicate a shorter time in the system, but this factor alone does not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without a conviction may suggest potential for future criminal behavior, though it is not definitive.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Not being married and living alone could indicate some level of social instability but does not directly correlate with high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED significantly increases the risk of reoffending, as education is crucial for avoiding further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Employed three jobs may suggest past stability but does not guarantee future behavior change without addressing underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially with current negative mental state, significantly raises the risk of engaging in similar behavior again.\"),\n    (\"Youth Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological father in a household of three may have some impact but is less significant compared to other factors like education or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with his life could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might influence behavior but does not directly correlate with high risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
