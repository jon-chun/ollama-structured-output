    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which is relatively young, but she has a prior arrest and conviction. Young adults can sometimes have more impulsive decisions, so that might be a medium factor pushing towards high risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there's some racial disparity in the criminal justice system, with higher rearrest rates for Black individuals, but being White alone probably doesn't add much unless there are specific factors related to her background. So maybe this is low or no impact here.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. That's a bit overweight, which could be a risk factor because obesity is linked to higher recidivism rates due to health issues or substance use problems. So that might be medium-high.\n\nNo family ties; she's living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation and stress, which are known contributors to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. That's another medium factor pushing towards high risk.\n\nShe has no HS diploma or GED. Without education, she might not have the skills needed for stable employment and could turn to drugs or other activities that increase recidivism. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe held only 1 job during the year, which is quite recent. Joblessness can lead to unemployment issues and increased substance use, so another medium-high factor.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine) shows she's already involved in drug use. Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism because it can lead to other criminal behaviors or longer prison sentences. That's high risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but her history of drug use might have caused some mental health issues that led to substance abuse rather than depression. Not sure if this leans one way or another, maybe neutral, but her drug use is already a significant factor.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with her biological mother in a large household suggests she was raised in an environment with potential neglect or abuse, especially since the household size was 7. That's a red flag and could be high risk because of possible trauma affecting her behavior and decision-making.\n\nShe considers God to have influence on her life; that's more of a personal belief rather than a risk factor unless she has a history of spiritual abuse or neglect from her upbringing, which isn't indicated here. So maybe this is low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (medium), obesity (medium-high), living alone (medium), lack of education (high), recent joblessness (medium-high), drug use (high), trauma history (high). The high factors are pulling the prediction towards a higher risk.\n\nConsidering all these, I think her likelihood of rearrest in three years is fairly high. So maybe an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals often have more impulsive decisions; this prior arrest increases the risk.\"),\n    (\"obesity\", \"high\", \"Overweight individuals are at higher risk for health issues and substance use, both linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, potentially increasing stress and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"A lack of education can impair career opportunities and self-reliance, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"medium\", \"Recent joblessness may lead to unemployment issues and increased substance use leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a significant predictor of future criminal behavior or longer sentences contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"trauma_history\", \"high\", \"Trauma experienced as a child, especially in a large household, can significantly impact behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
