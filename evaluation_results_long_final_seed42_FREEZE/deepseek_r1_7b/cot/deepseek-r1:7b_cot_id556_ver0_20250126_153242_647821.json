    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested three times. So first, his age is 18, which might mean he's still developing socially and maybe has less life experience compared to an adult. He's white, but race shouldn't be a factor here unless there's systemic bias, but I'll focus on the given factors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and convicted, so that's a clear history of criminal behavior. That's definitely a high risk factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 140 lbs \u2013 not sure if that affects anything here unless there's something about his physical health, but nothing in the question suggests it does.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That might be a factor because living alone could limit support systems or social connections which are beneficial for avoiding recidivism. But I'm not entirely sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, so maybe he's looking for a better future and trying to avoid further trouble. That could be positive, but it also depends on his academic performance and whether he has the support to succeed.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, which isn't bad, but having no steady income might lead him into other situations. But again, if he's stable at work, maybe that's not a big risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some of the last month. That could indicate possible mood swings or emotional issues. It's concerning because substance abuse can increase crime rates but also might affect his ability to make good decisions. The recent feelings of low mood might suggest he's struggling, which could influence his behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That's a bit unusual and could imply family issues or lack of support. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that adds to the risk.\n\nHe believes in God, but I'm not sure how that affects him. Some people use religion as a coping mechanism, which might help with emotional distress, but others might struggle more if they don't find it supportive.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high. Employment status is mixed; he's working but maybe not stable enough. Drug use and mood issues could contribute to instability or impulsive behavior. His family background isn't ideal, living in a big household with his mother in an urban area. He's 18, so perhaps more susceptible to peer influences.\n\nI think the risk factors are leaning towards high because of the three prior convictions alone. The other factors like drug use and family environment add to it. I'm not sure about the school enrollment turning into a high or medium; maybe medium since he's trying to get better but could have support issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"His three prior arrests and convictions significantly increase his risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mood Issues\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) and recent emotional distress may contribute to unstable behavior or impulsive actions, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four in an urban area may indicate potential family issues that could influence his stability and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"While employed, his job might not provide sufficient support or opportunities for growth, but he is actively working which can sometimes be a mitigating factor if the job is stable and supportive.\"),\n    (\"School Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Currently enrolled in school may indicate a desire to change circumstances, but without additional context on academic performance or social support, this could be a risk factor if it leads to other destabilizing factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
