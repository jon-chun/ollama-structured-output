    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with six arrests but no convictions. That raises some red flags because not being convicted might mean he's avoiding legal consequences, which could indicate a higher tendency to commit new crimes.\n\nHis weight and height don't seem directly related to recidivism, so that probably doesn't contribute much of a risk factor.\n\nHe's living alone, which is common among many people. Living at home isn't inherently a risk factor unless he has unstable environments or neglectful parents, but there's no information about that here.\n\nNot having a high school diploma and not attending college might mean he lacks the necessary skills for employment, increasing the chance of engaging in risky behaviors to support himself.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates because individuals may turn to drugs or other activities to cope without income.\n\nUsing drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, even just recently can impair judgment and decision-making. Substance abuse is a known predictor of recidivism.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood for four weeks straight could be related to substance use but might also indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to further problems if untreated.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived in a household of four. While household size doesn't directly correlate with risk, it's possible living in a larger family could mean more supervision or less involvement from parents, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has some level of spirituality, which might help him cope but doesn\u2019t necessarily reduce recidivism risk unless there are other factors related to his spiritual practices that aren't mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest history without convictions is a significant factor. His lack of education and job experience, combined with drug use and recent low mood, points towards a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History Without Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a criminal history with six arrests but no convictions.
