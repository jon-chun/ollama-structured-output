    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this person over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's a 20-year-old male from Asia/Pacific Islander. Young age might mean he has fewer life experiences, which could correlate with lower criminal tendencies. But it also depends on his background and opportunities.\n\nNext, criminal history: He's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest can still be significant; however, since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact is less severe than someone with a full record. So this might lean towards low or medium risk.\n\nEthnicity: Being Asian/Pacific Islander doesn't directly indicate high risk, but it could influence factors like family structure or community support which aren't provided here. Maybe neutral.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'4\" and between 125-149 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is without knowing his BMI or other health factors. Maybe not a strong indicator here.\n\nMarital status: He's single, so he doesn't have a support system of married partners which might offer more stability or resources. Could increase risk slightly.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not college. Some people with lower education might be less motivated to commit crimes, but others might use it as a means. Not sure yet.\n\nEmployment: Held one job recently. Employment can reduce recidivism because having a stable income and purpose can decrease the incentive to engage in criminal activity. So maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use could be a red flag, as drug-related crimes are common. However, if he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's more motivated for other reasons. Could be medium risk.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Eight members was a big household. Larger families can provide more support and stability, which might reduce risk. So this could be low or neutral.\n\nReligion: Believes God is involved in his life. Religious beliefs often promote community and moral values, which can reduce recidivism by providing guidance. This might lower the risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Low for criminal history (not convicted), education, employment.\n- Medium for drug use but no recent depression; maybe some connection to substance abuse issues.\n- Neutral or low for household size and religion.\n\nThe strongest factors are the lack of conviction, stable job, and family support. But the past drug use could be a concern if it's related to criminal behavior now. Without more info on current substance use or any other risk factors like mental health indicators (like depression), it's a bit tricky. Maybe lean towards low confidence because some factors are conflicting.\n\nSo prediction: Low relative risk, but considering potential drug-related issues, maybe medium? I think the final decision should be cautious and assign high confidence to avoid overestimating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age (20 years) may indicate fewer life experiences potentially reducing criminal tendencies but lacks direct correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction could suggest potential risk, though less severe than multiple convictions or new charges.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"No significant impact from being Asian/Pacific Islander as factors like family and community support are not provided.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"neutral\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism without additional health data.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide less stability, potentially increasing risk slightly but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma suggests some motivation for stability over criminal activity but possible lower drive for offense\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Recent job held reduces incentive to commit crimes through financial or purpose-related reasons.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine could relate to substance abuse, potentially influencing recidivism risk without current indicators of recent involvement.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"neutral\", \"Large household size may offer support but no direct impact on current risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God promoting community and moral values which could positively influence reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
