    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, being White doesn't inherently increase crime rates, but it's possible that systemic issues might affect him more than others in some places. However, without specific data linking his race to higher risk, maybe this isn't a significant factor here.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. Recidivism is about reoffending, so prior convictions are definitely a red flag. One conviction does increase the chance he'll get involved again.\n\nHis height is 6 feet, which makes him quite tall, but I don't think physical characteristics like that usually influence recidivism rates unless there's some data suggesting taller individuals have higher risks, which doesn't ring a bell for me right now.\n\nHe's over 250 lbs and living alone. Weight could be a sign of health issues, maybe something he's dealing with that affects his ability to hold a job or live independently. Living alone can sometimes lead to more isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nNo family history of being married or raising kids is mentioned, but he's currently living alone and never been married. That's interesting because family support can play a role in helping someone reintegrate into society after incarceration.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Not completing school often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it limits opportunities for better jobs and education which can aid in avoiding further trouble.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which is quite limited. Employment stability and having skills that lead to better opportunities are usually positive factors. Not working much might mean he's struggling economically or dealing with personal issues.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both negative and sometimes positive effects, depending on context. Since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's managed to stay sober enough to function, but past use still puts him at risk.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't influence his personal life might affect his motivation towards changing his behavior or seeking help. Without religious support, he might rely more on other factors like social networks or personal determination, which could be either positive or negative depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a prior conviction, limited education, small family background, and drug use history. These are all significant risk factors that point towards higher recidivism. However, without specific data linking his personal beliefs to increased risk, I'll focus on the more established factors like prior convictions, lack of education, job stability, and drug use.\n\nSo, considering all these points, his risk is probably high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Limited education or GED status correlates with higher recidivism rates as it may impede career and personal development efforts.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for a year might indicate limited support network or opportunities, which can contribute to risky behaviors but isn't the most direct factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use history, especially within the past four years, is a strong indicator of potential continued substance abuse and associated risks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
