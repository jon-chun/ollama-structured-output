    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times but not convicted. Since he's a minor offense like marijuana use, maybe it doesn't have significant consequences. So the number of past arrests might be low here.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. No info on how this affects risk, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nNever married and living alone. That's good for risk assessment because he has no support network, but maybe not directly related to recidivism.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college. Education level is positive; more education usually means better job prospects and lower risk.\n\nHe held four jobs in a year. Job experience is good as it shows responsibility and ability to manage.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to problems, but since he's not experiencing issues now, maybe the risk is low.\n\nAt a young age in a household of three. Young age might mean more impulsive decisions, so medium risk here.\n\nBelieves in God. That's generally protective unless there's evidence otherwise, so probably low or medium.\n\nPutting it all together: mostly low factors with some medium ones like drug use and household size. So the overall prediction is low to medium risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has been arrested three times but not convicted, which may indicate prior minor offenses that did not result in significant complications or legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on risk assessment as no relevant factors related to height and weight were provided for this analysis.\"),\n    (\"Marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age, with no ties to a family unit, which could imply limited support network but not directly indicative of high risk behavior\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Currently enrolled in a 2-year college after obtaining a high school diploma; higher education is typically associated with better job prospects and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Worked four jobs in the past year, which can be a positive factor as it suggests stability and the ability to manage responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Has used marijuana in the past four years but has not felt depressed recently; drug use without concurrent mental health issues may have limited direct impact on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of three at a young age, which could suggest potential for increased exposure to peer influences or social stressors that might contribute to risky behavior if not properly managed.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes in God; religious beliefs can serve as protective factors by promoting ethical decision-making and maintaining moral accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
