    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. She has multiple arrest convictions, which immediately raise her risk level. Her age might suggest she's still developing, so maybe she's less likely to commit serious crimes now.\n\nHer Hispanic origin isn't directly related to crime rates unless there are specific biases or systemic issues, but it doesn't necessarily increase her risk. Marital status and living alone\u2014being single could mean she's more independent, which might reduce opportunities for reoffending, though that's a double-edged sword since some people commit new crimes in different settings.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't attending college. Some educational limitations can lead to lower life choices or increased risk if not properly supported. Having held two jobs shows she can manage her finances, which might indicate better self-control, but sometimes job loss or instability can increase recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign, showing discipline and responsibility. Not feeling depressed for a month suggests she's mentally stable, which supports her stability after release.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of four from an urban area might have social implications, but without knowing if it was a supportive environment, it's hard to gauge the impact on her now.\n\nHer lack of religious affiliation could affect her personal motivation or support system. Considering she feels God isn't involved in her life, maybe she relies more on external factors which might not provide the same level of accountability.\n\nPutting this all together, her multiple prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. The other factors don't completely negate that risk but also don't tip it towards low or medium. So overall, I'd lean towards high risk with some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested 5 times indicates a history of criminal behavior which can increase the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age may correlate with higher risk for certain types of crimes, but at 21, she is still developing and less likely to commit serious offenses.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not directly contribute to increased risk without systemic or personal context that may influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after marriage might reduce opportunities for casual interactions but could also limit support networks which can aid in reintegration and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not attending college suggests some level of education but also indicates potential lack of support for higher education or career advancement which may correlate with lower risk if education is utilized for positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs demonstrates stability, which can be protective against recidivism, but it's possible that job loss could increase risk in the future if not properly supported.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years is a positive indicator of discipline and responsibility, reducing potential for substance-related crimes or incidents.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed for a month suggests mental stability which can be protective against impulsive or harmful behaviors that might lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"biographical_context\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area of household size 4 could have both positive and negative influences depending on the family's dynamics, supportiveness, and environment which are not fully understood.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may influence personal motivation or lack thereof but does not inherently correlate with higher risk unless it affects her personal accountability or support system which is not indicated here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
