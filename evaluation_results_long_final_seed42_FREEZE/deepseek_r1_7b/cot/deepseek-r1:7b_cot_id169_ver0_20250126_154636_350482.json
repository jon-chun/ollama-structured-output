    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's White, has a high school diploma, no college, and lives alone with his parents in an urban area. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he has four prior convictions. I know that more past convictions generally mean higher risk because it shows a history of criminal behavior. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe uses marijuana, which is a drug use. But since it's nonpsychoactive, maybe the impact isn't as significant as something like alcohol or substances that affect judgment. Still, any substance abuse could be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHis job history: he worked two jobs in the past year. Working can sometimes lead to substance abuse if the money pressure is high, but since he's stable with two jobs, maybe this isn't a big risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. That might suggest some social instability or lack of support, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHis family background: he lived with both parents at age 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say how that affects him now. However, living with both parents might indicate a stable home environment initially, but maybe there are issues elsewhere.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. That could be a positive factor since religious support can offer guidance and reduce stress, which might lower the risk of substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: four prior convictions are a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to similar issues again. The presence of any substance use (even marijuana) is concerning but maybe not as critical without a history of other issues. Living alone and family background might add some instability, but the main factors here are the convictions.\n\nSo overall, I'd lean towards high risk because of the past convictions. The other factors don't completely negate that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has four prior convictions which indicates a history of criminal behavior and potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is noted, but as it's nonpsychoactive, its impact on recidivism may be less significant compared to other substances.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Two job involvements in the past year could indicate stability but might also suggest underlying issues like substance abuse affecting productivity.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents at a young age and now living alone suggests some support, though it may also hint at potential stress or instability factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Strong religious belief which could provide guidance and reduce stress related to negative behaviors like substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
