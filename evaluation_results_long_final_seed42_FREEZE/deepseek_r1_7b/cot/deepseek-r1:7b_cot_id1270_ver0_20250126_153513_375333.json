    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag. Recidivism tends to run higher for people with prior convictions because they've already broken the law once.\n\nHe's Hispanic, but I don't think race is a direct factor unless there's systemic issues, which might not apply here since we're looking at individual factors.\n\nHis height and weight are noted\u20146'1\" and 240 lbs. That doesn't immediately affect his risk, though maybe being overweight could be a concern for substance use or health issues, but he's already using drugs so that's covered elsewhere.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living in a stable environment usually correlates with lower recidivism, but since he's homeless now, it might indicate other issues like unstable family life or lack of support.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment often predicts future stability\u2014if someone doesn't have the skills to get ahead, they're more likely to engage in criminal behavior again.\n\nNot working during the year is concerning because joblessness can lead to welfare dependency, which might increase stress or substance use. Also, without any income, he's at risk of losing what he has if things go south.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine for four years\u2014is a significant factor. Drug abuse makes re-arrest more likely due to potential drug-related issues like addiction, which can impede his ability to reintegrate into society or find employment.\n\nHe feels no depression in the past month. While this is positive, it's not directly related unless there are underlying mental health issues that aren't mentioned here.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with his biological mother suggests he might have experienced some form of neglect or emotional abuse, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates due to trauma-related behaviors.\n\nHis belief in God indicates a level of religious support and perhaps some self-discipline, but it's not a guarantee against criminal behavior; sometimes religion can lead to risky decisions if the individual is struggling with sin.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior arrest (high), lack of education (high), unemployment (high), drug use (high), unstable living situation (medium?), religious support (low). The high factors are probably more influential. So, overall risk seems pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as recidivism rates tend to be higher for those with a history of criminal behavior.\" ),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate can lead to limited opportunities and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors or returning to\u76d1\u72f1.\" ),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Not working during the year puts him at risk of becoming economically dependent on the criminal justice system, increasing stress and dependency issues.\" ),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use history, particularly marijuana and cocaine, can lead to addiction which may impede his ability to reintegrate into society or find employment.\" ),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living with four family members might indicate past experiences of neglect or emotional abuse, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates due to trauma-related behaviors.\" ),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No mention of depression in the past month; however, mental health issues not addressed here could be a contributing factor.\" )\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
