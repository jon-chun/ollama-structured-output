    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has two arrests but no convictions. That might not be a strong indicator yet, as criminal history can sometimes change or not lead to convictions. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. Weight isn't directly predictive of recidivism unless it's linked to health issues which aren't mentioned here. So probably low impact.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation doesn't usually predict recidivism unless there's family support, but he has none here. So maybe low weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education is a significant factor; lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism. So this should be medium to high weight.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Job stability can reduce recidivism risk because having income might provide motivation and reduce criminal behavior. But if he's been unemployed or underemployed, maybe it affects him differently. Not sure yet how much weight to give here; perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. No recent drug use during the past month is a good sign. However, prior use can be linked to higher recidivism if it's a substance abuse problem that might affect future behavior. So maybe low or medium weight.\n\nHe felt down for some of the past month. Emotional distress can sometimes lead to criminal impulse but could also indicate support seeking. If he's feeling down and hasn't acted on it, maybe less impact. But if he's been struggling, perhaps higher risk. Not sure yet; maybe medium.\n\nYoung age at 20, lived with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might have some underlying issues but doesn't directly correlate to high recidivism unless there are family dysfunction issues. But it's not a strong risk factor on its own; maybe low weight.\n\nDoesn't believe in God, which could mean he's more self-reliant or possibly more rebellious, increasing risk slightly. Medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Education is the strongest negative risk (medium high), followed by living situation and lack of job stability. The rest are either neutral or low impact.\n\nSo, considering these factors, his predicted 3-year rearrest recidivism would be medium to high but leaning towards high because of education issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"He has two arrests but no convictions, which may not strongly predict future recidivism yet.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant health indicators related to recidivism from his weight or height.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently predict higher recidivism unless there's a lack of support.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college are risk factors linked to recidivism.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Held three jobs, which could indicate some stability but may also suggest underemployment.\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"No recent use during the past month; prior use is a minor concern unless it's frequent.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Felt down recently, which could indicate stress or potential substance issues affecting behavior.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Upbringing in Rural Area\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a rural household of three doesn't strongly correlate with high recidivism unless there are family dysfunction issues.\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Doesn't believe in God, which might suggest self-reliance but could also imply higher rebelliousness.\",\n     \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
