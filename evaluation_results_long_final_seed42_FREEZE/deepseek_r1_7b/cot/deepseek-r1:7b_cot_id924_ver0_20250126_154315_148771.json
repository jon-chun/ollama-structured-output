    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of two arrests and one conviction. That's a significant criminal record, so that should definitely be high risk because past convictions are strong indicators of future behavior.\n\nHis weight is 5'8\" and 160 lbs, but I don't think height or weight alone contribute much to recidivism without other factors like BMI or how they affect daily life. So maybe low risk from this factor.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse or children, which might mean he doesn't have a support system that could help him if something happens. That might be medium risk because isolation can increase stress and dependency on personal resources.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests he might not have the skills needed for stable employment. That's another high risk factor because unemployment often leads to more substance use and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) which is a strong indicator of ongoing substance abuse issues. Substance use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behavior, and lead to further legal or criminal consequences. So this should be high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. If he's not dealing with mental health issues, it might suggest better coping mechanisms, which could lower his risk a bit. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like drug use and lack of education.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five in a rural area at a young age could mean he didn't have much supervision or support. This environment can lead to higher stress levels and perhaps more deviant behavior as he gets older, which would be medium risk.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might affect his motivation towards positive behaviors or seeking help when needed. If he doesn't see a higher power as a motivator, he might not seek counseling or support services on his own, increasing risk slightly.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from criminal history and drug use; medium from living alone without support; high due to lack of education leading to unstable life; maybe low due to no depression. But the most significant factors are the high risk ones, so overall prediction is high confidence that he'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of two arrests and one conviction, which strongly indicates past criminal behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without spouse or children can lead to isolation and increased stress, potentially affecting decision-making and risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college may lead to limited opportunities and contribute to risky behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates ongoing substance abuse, which can impair judgment and increase criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests better coping mechanisms or support systems that may mitigate behavioral issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
