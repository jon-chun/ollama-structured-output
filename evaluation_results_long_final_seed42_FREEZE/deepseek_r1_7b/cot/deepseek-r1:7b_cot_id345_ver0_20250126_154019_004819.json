    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors, but at 20 years old, the impact might be less pronounced compared to older individuals who have more criminal history or other risk factors.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to higher chances of rearrest. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 128 lbs, which doesn't immediately seem relevant but might be important in assessing if he's an adult capable of making responsible decisions, though at 20, he should be an adult.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to stay out of trouble or get help when needed. But without more info on his environment, it's hard to gauge the impact here.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is important; having a high school diploma might correlate with lower risk compared to those with less education or alternative outcomes.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs in a year. Job stability can be a factor; holding multiple jobs can provide income and stability, which might reduce recidivism. However, if he's been in and out of work, that could also indicate other issues like substance abuse.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only). Drug use, especially if it's recent, might affect his mental state or decision-making. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign but doesn't negate past issues.\n\nYoung age of living with both parents at a household size of 4 in a rural area. Growing up in such a context can have both protective and risk factors. Being in a large household might mean more supervision or stress from parents, but it's hard to assess without knowing the environment better.\n\nBelieves in God affecting personal decisions. His religious beliefs could influence his behavior; however, it's subjective and might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there are known issues related to religion.\n\nPutting all this together: The key factors here are prior conviction (high risk), job history (could be a positive but maybe also negative if unstable), living situation alone (possible isolation leading to higher risk), and drug use. The race is White, which might not add much at such an early stage compared to other factors.\n\nSo, considering all these points, his risk of rearrest seems moderately high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"His one prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs may indicate some instability but could also suggest a desire to work and potentially reduce recidivism risk through financial stability.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can lead to increased vulnerability, though this factor's impact is somewhat mitigated by other protective factors like holding multiple jobs and having no prior felony convictions.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use may have negative consequences but does not directly correlate with rearrest unless it leads to further issues.
