    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Asian/Pacific Islander. From what I know, there are some disparities in the criminal justice system affecting different ethnic groups, but at this point, without specific data on how that might influence recidivism, it's hard to assign a weight. So maybe medium risk because systemic issues could play a role.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Recidivism is definitely higher for those with a history of arrest, so this is a high factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; body metrics usually aren't predictive factors unless there's something specific about them, which isn't the case here.\n\n living alone... Well, being in a stable environment can help prevent recidivism because it reduces stress and substance use risks. So maybe low risk from this factor.\n\nHe\u2019s not married, but again, marital status doesn\u2019t directly relate to recidivism unless there's something about parenting or support systems missing. Since he's living alone, I\u2019d lean towards low risk here too.\n\nHigh school diploma... Education can be a mitigating factor because having a degree might increase employability and stability. So medium risk from this point.\n\nHe\u2019s in college for two years; continuing education is positive, so maybe reduce the risk further to low or medium.\n\nOnly one job during the year isn't great, as unemployment can lead to substance abuse or lack of support. This could be a medium factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression\u2014positive indicators that he's in control of his life. So low risk from this angle.\n\nAt a young age, living with five people... That\u2019s a household size which might mean more supervision and less risk of environmental issues leading to delinquency. So maybe high mitigating factor here.\n\nHis belief in God as part of his personal fate\u2014religion can sometimes provide support or guidance, so that's positive. Maybe a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: two convictions (high), no drug use/depression (low), living with five people (high mitigating). Education and being in college are medium but only one job is medium negative. His age might make him more susceptible to such issues since he\u2019s still young, so maybe slightly higher risk there.\n\nSo overall prediction would be low to medium risk of rearrest. Maybe lean towards low because of the positive factors like no drugs or depression, living with multiple people, and being in education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of arrest and conviction, which is typically associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use indicates better control over substance abuse, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone and having a larger household size can provide more stability, mitigating recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests some educational stability but may not directly correlate with reduced risk compared to lower education individuals.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year might indicate potential instability leading to higher risk factors like substance abuse or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates better mental health and control over personal well-being, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with five people at a young age may provide more supervision and stability, mitigating recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
