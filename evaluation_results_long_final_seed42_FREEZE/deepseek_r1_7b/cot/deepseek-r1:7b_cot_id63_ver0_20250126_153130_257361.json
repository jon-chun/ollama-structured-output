Let's break down all the factors given.\n\nFirst, she has only one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad on its own since she's still working towards getting that conviction. Maybe it's a minor offense or something she's worked through.\n\nShe's Hispanic, which could play into things like systemic issues in the justice system, maybe access to resources, but I'm not sure how significant that is here without more context.\n\nHer height and weight aren't factors unless there's something about her physical health, but she doesn't mention any health issues or substance abuse. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone, so maybe she has some support network, like family or friends. That could be beneficial for her stability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means she didn't finish that part of her education. Being out of school can sometimes lead to other issues, but she's not in college either, which might indicate she's looking to get an education. I'm not sure how that affects recidivism though.\n\nShe hasn't held a job during the past year, so maybe she's actively seeking employment or maybe trying different things, but no job means she could be vulnerable if something comes up.\n\nHer recent feelings of down mood for the past month is interesting. She says some of the time it's been so bad that nothing could cheer her up. That might relate to mental health issues which can definitely impact recidivism rates. I'm not sure how severe this depression or anxiety is, but even mild mental health issues can be a risk factor.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of nine in an urban area. That's quite a large family and living in an urban environment could have its own set of challenges, maybe more stressors which could affect her mental state or ability to function.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a positive factor generally associated with lower recidivism rates, but again, without knowing how she integrates that into her life, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: The lack of a conviction isn't a strong risk. Her living situation could be stressful, possibly affecting her mental health or stability. Her education level is low, which might limit opportunities but also sometimes can lead to more involvement in the criminal system if she's not motivated enough. Her recent mood issues are concerning and could directly impact her ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a medium risk because while there are some positive signs like education and support systems, other factors like mental health and family environment contribute to a moderate level of risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Her one arrest is not convictions, indicating potential for redemption or future accountability.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a large household may introduce stressors that could impact mental health and stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities but also indicates she may be motivated to improve.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Recent mood issues, especially severe feelings of depression, can significantly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment could expose her to financial and social risks, though it's an area for proactive support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs between 100 and 124 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
