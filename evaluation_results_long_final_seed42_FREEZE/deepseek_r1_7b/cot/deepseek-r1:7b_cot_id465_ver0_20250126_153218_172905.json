    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a high school diploma but isn't convicted of any crimes yet. That might mean she hasn't faced the consequences of her actions, which could be a positive sign in terms of motivation to change. But I'm not sure how that translates into risk factors right now.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. That might indicate some independence, but it could also suggest past instability or perhaps lack of support systems. However, at 22, she's still young, so maybe she has a good foundation to build on.\n\nHer job history: she's held two jobs in the past year. Having work experience can be beneficial because it shows responsibility and practical skills, which might help prevent future issues.\n\nShe doesn't use drugs and hasn't felt depressed recently. These are positive traits that could correlate with lower risk of recidivism.\n\nLooking at her family background, she lived with other adults in a household of three as a young person in an urban area. This suggests some exposure to adult interactions but maybe not directly related to criminal history unless there were incidents during those years.\n\nHer religious affiliation is God; I'm not sure how that affects risk, but it might provide a sense of direction or support system which could be positive.\n\nPutting it all together: She has no prior convictions, so that's a good starting point. Her job experience and lack of drug use are positives. However, her past living situation with non-biological family might have had challenges that aren't directly linked to crime but could indicate other risk factors like stress or neglect. \n\nSince she's 22, the recidivism rate is generally lower compared to older individuals. Without any prior convictions and stable living conditions, her risk seems low.\n\nI think each factor either contributes positively (low) or doesn't add significant risk (medium). Since none of these red flags are present except maybe the past family situation which isn't directly linked to crime, I'd assign mostly low factors with perhaps a medium one that doesn't tip it over. So overall, the prediction is she's not likely to recidivate within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No prior convictions\", \"low\", \"Her lack of prior convictions indicates no direct criminal history, which is a positive factor in assessing her risk for rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Stable job history\", \"low\", \"She has held two jobs during the year, suggesting she can manage her responsibilities and may have gained work experience that could aid in preventing future issues.\"),\n    (\"No drug use or depression\", \"low\", \"Her lack of drug use and recent absence from feeling depressed are positive indicators of her mental health and self-care, which can contribute to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation with non-biological family\", \"medium\", \"Living with other adults in a household of size 3 may have had challenges that could indirectly affect her stability or well-being, potentially contributing to a slightly higher risk compared to those living with extended family support.\"),\n    (\"Young age and religious affiliation\", \"low\", \"Being 22 years old means she has fewer life experiences associated with criminal behavior.
