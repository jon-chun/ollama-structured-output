    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this information about a young woman who's being assessed for recidivism over the next three years. She's an 18-year-old Black female with two prior convictions. Let me break down her profile to figure out her risk factors.\n\nFirst off, she has a criminal history with two arrests and one conviction. That already sounds concerning because having a criminal record can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's definitely a high risk factor\u2014high risk for prior convictions.\n\nHer age is 18, which might mean she's still developing her life skills, but it also could be a point to consider if she's making decisions that aren't fully mature yet. I'm not sure how much weight that should carry compared to other factors like education or employment.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lacking education can limit opportunities for positive development, which might contribute to recidivism. Education is usually a mitigating factor, but without it, that's a red flag\u2014so maybe medium risk here because she could improve with more support.\n\nShe's living alone, which is fine, but if anything, being an only child or living independently at such a young age might not directly correlate to higher recidivism unless there are personal issues. But since she's never been married and considers herself an only child, maybe that's not a significant risk factor\u2014perhaps low.\n\nShe has two job experiences in the past year. Having some work experience is positive because it can provide stability and reduce stress. Two jobs might indicate she's managed her time well, which could be good for reducing recidivism\u2014their contribution would be medium, but maybe slightly lower since having a job is better than none.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse can have serious consequences on mental health and future decision-making. It might lead to more impulsive behavior or substance abuse issues that could contribute to recidivism\u2014so high risk here.\n\nHer emotional state over the past month is positive; she hasn't felt depressed. That's a good sign, so this factor isn't contributing to higher risk\u2014it's actually mitigating\u2014maybe low.\n\nShe was a child in an urban area living with her biological mother in a household of five. This indicates she had a complex upbringing. While it might have its challenges, the environment itself doesn't directly point to high recidivism unless there were issues like abuse or neglect, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe medium risk because it's about her past experiences.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal life\u2014this is more of a positive factor related to personal values and behavior rather than a direct risk indicator. It might influence her decision-making positively, so not much of a risk factor\u2014maybe low.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (high), lack of education (medium), drug use (high), no depression recently (low mitigator). The presence of two jobs is positive but doesn't offset the other factors enough. The complex family background might have both pros and cons, but without issues noted, it's medium.\n\nSo overall risk assessment: High because of the prior convictions and drug use. The lack of education contributes moderately, but her job experience helps somewhat. The family background isn't a strong risk factor since no negatives are mentioned. Therefore, I'd assign a higher probability to rearrest within three years\u2014probably around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a criminal history with two arrests and one conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education (no high school diploma or GED) can limit opportunities for positive development but is mitigated by current employment efforts.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years may lead to impulsive behavior and substance abuse issues that contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression, indicating a positive emotional state which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban household of five may have complex dynamics but no negatives noted, contributing to moderate risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
