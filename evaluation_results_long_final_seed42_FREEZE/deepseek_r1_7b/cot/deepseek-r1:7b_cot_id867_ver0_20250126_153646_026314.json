    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 19-year-old male based on the given factors. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested three times but not convicted. That might be a low to medium risk since lack of conviction doesn't always lead to harsher sentences immediately, especially if it's his first few offenses.\n\nHis height and weight are mentioned, but I don't think that directly affects recidivism unless there's some association with other factors, which isn't provided here. So probably no impact on the risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living arrangements can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors or substance use, so maybe a medium weight.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college\u2014so he's likely more stable. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides better job opportunities and life skills. So this might decrease the risk, contributing to a lower relative weight.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having gainful employment is generally protective against reoffending. More income can lead to better support systems and less time spent on street activities. So maybe low or medium here depending on the job stability, but he's actively working so likely medium.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana before, which could be a red flag because even if it's just marijuana, it might indicate substance abuse issues. The mention that some of the time in the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up adds to that. This is probably high risk since drug use can lead to impulsive behaviors or increased risk of other crimes.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Urban environments are sometimes associated with higher crime rates, which could influence recidivism. However, if he's now living alone and has moved away from that environment, maybe the effect is mitigated. But still, it might contribute to medium risk.\n\nBelieving God doesn't affect his personal life; this seems more about his spirituality but not directly linked to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: the three most significant factors are lack of conviction (low), high school diploma (low), two jobs (medium). The biggest risk factor is past drug use and mood issues, which would probably be high. \n\nSo overall, considering the high risk from drug use and mood, I'd predict he might have a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"low\", \"The individual has been arrested three times but not convicted.
