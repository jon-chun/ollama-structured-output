    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 21-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested seven times but not convicted. He's got a high school diploma and is in college, which might suggest some level of education that could relate to positive behavior or lack of criminal tendencies.\n\nHis past drug use (marijuana) four years ago is concerning. Drug use can sometimes lead to more risky situations or self-harm, though he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate a change in mindset. His living situation\u2014being 21 and not living alone without a partner\u2014could mean less supervision, increasing risk of recidivism.\n\nThe fact that he's been arrested seven times could be a red flag for recidivism, even if not convicted. Each arrest puts more strain on resources and might signal unstable home environments or lack of support.\n\nHe's considered religious, which can sometimes correlate with higher moral standards or seeking help, but it also varies widely in how that influence plays out.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests despite not being convicted is a significant factor. The past drug use adds to the risk, though recent positive feelings about depression might mitigate it slightly. His living situation and lack of family support could contribute as well. I'm leaning towards a medium-high confidence in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of seven arrests, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Previous drug use (marijuana) may correlate with increased risk but recent positive feelings about depression could slightly mitigate this factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a partner can provide some degree of support, potentially reducing risk compared to living in larger households or unstable environments.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college despite having a high school diploma may indicate a desire for further education but does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year may suggest stability and economic independence, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Considering God as something that influences his personal life may indicate a higher likelihood of seeking help or maintaining moral standards, though this varies widely in practice.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 7 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 215 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
