    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is relatively young but still in his prime for reoffering after release. At that age, he might have more potential to commit new crimes once he's out.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a significant role here unless there are systemic factors at play, which aren't mentioned, so maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and hasn't been convicted yet. That means he still has time for the court process, but since it's just an arrest, that's probably a medium factor because a single non-conviction might not immediately increase his risk but could if other factors come into play later.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight is 155 lbs. These aren't directly related to recidivism unless there's something about his physical health, which isn't indicated here. So probably low influence.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone\u2014stability-wise, that might be a positive, but again, not a strong factor on its own. Maybe medium if he has issues maintaining relationships or substance use.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college could indicate some commitment to betterment, which is usually a lower risk. But the fact that he's only got a diploma might suggest he's struggling academically, so maybe slightly higher risk from that angle.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014employment is generally protective unless there were issues with it or substance use while working. Since he used drugs recently, especially marijuana, and felt low mood, that could affect his ability to function effectively at work or elsewhere. So this might be a medium factor towards higher risk.\n\nDrug use history, particularly recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood, are significant red flags. drug use can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to antisocial behaviors\u2014so high weight here.\n\nYoung age with living with both parents in a household of five suggests he had a lot of support from a young age but now is living alone. That might indicate some independence issues or challenges maintaining that environment on his own, which could be a medium factor pushing towards higher risk.\n\nBelieving in God indicates strong moral support and perhaps some internalization of positive values, which can sometimes mitigate risk factors\u2014so maybe this lowers the risk slightly, thus low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: The single non-conviction is medium. Drug use is high. Employment is medium but negative due to substance issues. Other factors like living alone and age are medium or low. So overall, considering the high risk from drug use, I'd lean towards a high probability of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may influence their ability to commit new crimes post-release but does not immediately indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race is White; without systemic factors, this factor has a low weight in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest suggests potential future involvement with the system if other issues arise.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate independence but may also suggest challenges that could increase risk if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest a commitment to further education, which is protective of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job during the year; however, recent substance use may affect employment effectiveness and work performance.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood increase risk factors such as impaired judgment and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\" household living situation at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Experienced living with five parents but now alone; this could indicate potential for increased risk if independence issues persist.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Strong moral support can sometimes mitigate certain negative risk factors, though it does not directly influence recidivism outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
