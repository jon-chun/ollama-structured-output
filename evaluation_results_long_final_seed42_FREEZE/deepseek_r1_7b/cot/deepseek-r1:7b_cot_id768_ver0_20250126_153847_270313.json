    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested four times with a conviction. That's significant because more arrests usually mean higher chances of reoffending. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's Hispanic, but I don't see how her ethnicity directly affects recidivism here; maybe it could influence factors like access to resources or community support, but the question doesn't mention those, so perhaps this is low.\n\nHeight and weight aren't relevant for risk assessment in this context. Maybe if there were health issues, but as it stands, these don't affect recidivism.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to stress or isolation, which might make her more prone to substance use or other risky behaviors. So that's a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment\u2014maybe she's not seeking higher education or support for skills needed in the workforce, so perhaps low risk from an educational standpoint.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year; job instability can lead to financial strain and increased risk of substance abuse or crime. But with three jobs, that might indicate some stability, so maybe medium.\n\nDrug use past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine both are illegal and can have negative consequences. This is a high risk because drug use often correlates with other criminal behaviors.\n\nHer mental health: felt down for most of the past month. That's concerning. Persistent low mood could be linked to substance abuse or other mental health issues, which increase recidivism risk\u2014so medium.\n\nYoung household at age 6\u2014maybe she experienced trauma or neglect, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates due to underlying issues like trauma or family dysfunction. High risk factor here.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014affecting her personal behavior? If she's religious and finds support there, it might reduce risk a bit, but if it's more about avoiding help from other circles, maybe no direct impact\u2014so low.\n\nPutting it all together: high (arrests), medium (drugs), high (trauma), medium (single living). The prediction is likely YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested four times and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Her use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, along with feelings of low mood recently, points to potential substance abuse issues that can lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Trauma at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of six from a young age may indicate trauma or neglect, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk due to underlying emotional or psychological issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for most of the past month could be related to substance abuse or other mental health issues that increase the risk of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 180 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
