    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this individual's rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is quite young. Young individuals might still be developing their skills and could face more challenges in employment or relationships. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nRace: Black. There have been studies showing systemic issues with the criminal justice system affecting minority communities. So this should be a high risk factor.\n\nPrior arrest: one time, but not convictions. A single non-conviction might mean he hasn't faced severe consequences, which could leave some residual risk but isn't necessarily high unless there's other factors. Maybe medium?\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\"/170 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is to recidivism. Probably low.\n\nMarital status: living alone with no kids, never married. Living alone can sometimes correlate with substance abuse or lack of support, which might contribute. Medium risk perhaps.\n\nEducation: high school diploma not enrolled in college. Maybe some instability or lower job prospects could increase risk, so medium.\n\nNumber of jobs: held two during the year. Having a steady job is generally positive for recidivism, but maybe if he's underemployed or unstable? Still, two jobs seems manageable. Medium.\n\nDrug use: past four years with marijuana. Drug use can lead to other issues like accidents or health problems, which might affect his ability to reintegrate. High risk because even non-convicted drug use could impact future behavior.\n\nMood: not felt depressed over the past month. A positive mood is good for reintegration. Maybe lower risk here, so low.\n\nYouthful living with biological mother in a household of seven: that's a lot of stress and potential neglect. Urban environment adds more stressors. This sounds like high risk factors contributing to problematic behavior or substance use.\n\nReligion: doesn't believe in God. Without religious support, he might rely on other social networks which could be weaker, increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the most significant risks are drug use and past youthful living conditions. These two would probably tip the prediction towards high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may indicate emerging life skills that could influence reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues in the criminal justice system, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest may suggest past behavior without severe consequences but no direct evidence of risk.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"These factors are generally unrelated to recidivism unless linked to physical health issues, which is not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no children could imply a need for support that might be absent, affecting reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may indicate lower job prospects or stability.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs suggest some economic independence but may not guarantee stable employment history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use could lead to substance abuse issues, which are known risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Mood\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests positive mental health, reducing barriers to reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Youthful Living Conditions\", \"high\", \" living with seven family members in an urban area may indicate past instability and neglect, contributing to high risk behavior or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief could mean fewer social supports compared to those with active religious involvement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
