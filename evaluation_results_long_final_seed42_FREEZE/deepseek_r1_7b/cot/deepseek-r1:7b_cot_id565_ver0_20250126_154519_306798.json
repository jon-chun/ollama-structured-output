    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this person predict the likelihood of a 19-year-old female being rearrested within three years. She's white, has one arrest but no conviction, is 5'4\" and weighs 115 lbs. She's living alone, never married, with a high school diploma in college for two years, held two jobs, hasn't used drugs in the past four years, felt down sometimes, lived with both parents at age 3 in an urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, let me break down each risk factor. I'll start by categorizing them as low, medium, or high based on their impact on recidivism.\n\n1. Age: She's 19, which is quite young. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing socially and economically. So that's a high risk factor.\n\n2. Arrests without conviction: One arrest isn't a conviction, so it might not show much criminal history but could indicate some risk if she's in trouble again. Medium risk here since one near miss can suggest potential for future issues.\n\n3. Education level: She has a diploma and is attending college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job prospects and life skills. So this might be low risk, but maybe not super high unless she's struggling to graduate.\n\n4. Employment status: Employed two jobs in the past year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism as it provides income and stability. This should be low risk since employment is a positive factor.\n\n5. Drug use: She hasn't used drugs for four years, so that's good. Not using drugs reduces the chances of engaging in criminal activities related to substance abuse. Low risk here.\n\n6. Emotional state: She felt down sometimes but says nothing could cheer her up. Emotional distress might affect her ability to manage her life or seek help, which could increase risk slightly. Maybe medium since she's aware of it but doesn't acknowledge it.\n\n7. Previous living situation: She lived with both parents at age 3 in an urban area. Living with supportive family can provide stability and good support systems, which usually reduce recidivism. So this is low risk as the environment was positive.\n\n8. Belief in God: She believes in God, but I don't think religion directly affects recidivism unless there's religious trauma or belief that affects her behavior. If she's mentally stable, it might not add much risk, so maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: High risk from age 19 and past near miss. Medium from emotional distress. Low from education, employment, no drug use, supportive family. So overall prediction would lean towards high risk but maybe with some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is a significant age for recidivism as they are still developing socially and economically.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"One near miss arrest could indicate potential for future criminal behavior despite not having a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and current enrollment in college suggest positive educational influences reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Employed two jobs in the past year, providing financial stability which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years, indicating better self-control and reduced risk factors associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Felt down occasionally but was unable to find comfort, suggesting potential emotional challenges that may affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"Previous Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area at a young age, providing a supportive environment that typically reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Believes in God but no mention of religious trauma or belief impacting behavior, suggesting stable mental state.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
