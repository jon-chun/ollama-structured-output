    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. The individual is a 20-year-old Black male with one arrest but no conviction. He's living alone, has a high school diploma and is in college, hasn't worked, used marijuana in the past four years, feels low sometimes, lived in a household of five from a young age in an urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, the recent arrest without a conviction might suggest he's still early in his criminal history. However, since it's not a conviction, maybe his behavior hasn't been severe yet. His living situation at a young age with both parents could indicate family support or perhaps some instability, but it's unclear how that affects recidivism.\n\nDrug use is a factor; even if he's only using marijuana, it can be a sign of substance abuse which might lead to more issues. Feeling low and sometimes unable to cope might point towards mental health issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nNot working could indicate lack of motivation or support. His educational background is good\u2014he has a diploma and is in college\u2014so maybe he's seeking better opportunities, but if he's not actively doing so, that could be a red flag.\n\nConsidering all these factors: low weight for recent arrest (since it's not a conviction), medium for drug use, medium for feelings of low mood, and high for the negative past living situation. Putting this together, his risk might lean towards medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"recent_arrest\", \"low\", \"The individual has one recent arrest but no prior conviction, which suggests that the offense may not have had significant consequences or he is still early in his criminal history.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"medium\", \"The use of marijuana indicates potential substance abuse, which can be a risk factor for recidivism as it may lead to other behavioral issues or increased susceptibility to stressors.\"),\n    (\"past_mood\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and not able to cope with life events could indicate mental health issues, which are often associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential substance abuse or emotional instability.\"),\n    (\"household_living\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five from a young age in an urban area may suggest family dysfunction or instability, which can contribute to higher risk of recidivism due to factors like neglect or lack of support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 169 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
