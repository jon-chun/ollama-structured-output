    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals might have fewer life experiences, which could mean lower recidivism. But it's also possible that they're still developing and might face challenges.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't think race is a direct indicator of recidivism in this case since the dataset used probably doesn't include race as a factor. So maybe this isn't a significant factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Having a criminal history, especially within two offenses, can increase the risk because of prior convictions and possible substance use issues.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 140 lbs. These factors aren't typically considered in recidivism assessments unless there's an indication of physical strain or associated health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he's a minor, that might not directly influence his risk as much as adult factors would.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school. While education is positive, it could indicate he's focused on self-improvement, which might lower recidivism risk compared to someone not studying.\n\nNo job during the year. Unemployment can contribute to substance use and other negative behaviors that increase recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years, but no recent depression. Drug use is a red flag because it can impair judgment and lead to risky behavior. However, if he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's more motivated towards positive change.\n\nFamily background: lived with both parents at age of young, household size 4 in an urban area. This could suggest a stable environment but also might be indicative of higher stress levels due to the size and urban living. It doesn't directly point to substance abuse or other risk factors.\n\nBelieves God is involved. While religious beliefs can provide support, it's more about personal motivation than a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history (medium) and drug use (high) are strong indicators of higher risk. Education and being enrolled might mitigate some risk, but the drugs probably have a significant impact. His family background doesn't add much positive or negative factors relevant to recidivism here.\n\nSo overall, despite some mitigating factors like education and being in school, the presence of drug use combined with prior arrests suggests a high relative weight for each factor, leading to a high risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"His age is 18, which might indicate fewer life experiences but could also suggest potential challenges affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race is not considered in this analysis as the dataset used does not include race as a factor.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests with one conviction increase risk due to prior convictions, though mitigated by current education and living situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over four years without recent depression suggests potential negative impacts on behavior and self-control.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment but possibly indicative of stress from urban living; no direct link to recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"No job during the year might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors, increasing risk indirectly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
