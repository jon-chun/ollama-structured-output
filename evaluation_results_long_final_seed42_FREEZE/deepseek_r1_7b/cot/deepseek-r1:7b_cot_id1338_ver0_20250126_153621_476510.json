    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether a 20-year-old Hispanic male has a high risk of rearrest within three years. He was arrested once but not convicted, which might mean he's currently on probation or in some treatment program. His height and weight don't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's not married and isn't living alone, so maybe he's with someone else. That could be a positive factor because living with others can contribute to better support systems, which might reduce the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which suggests some level of education but maybe not enough for higher opportunities. Maybe that's a negative if he's not motivated to learn more or improve his skills.\n\nHe worked one job during the year; having stable employment is usually good because it can provide steady income and reduce the need to look for work again.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of sobriety, which is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not feeling depressed for a month might indicate he's mentally stable, but not sure if that's directly related to recidivism.\n\nHe was raised in an urban area with his biological mother in a household size of 6. That's a family environment, but larger households can sometimes lead to more stress or less supervision, which might be a risk factor.\n\nBelieving in God could be seen as a positive because it might provide moral support and accountability, helping him stay on track.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors. The low risk factors include stable employment, no drug use, living with someone, and his education level isn't hindering him. High risk factors are the single arrest (though not convicted), household size, and maybe living in an urban area without supervision.\n\nI think he's on the lower end of the risk spectrum but still has some vulnerabilities, especially given his family background. So I'd assign a low relative weight to the high risk factors and medium to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time, not convicted)\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one arrest without a conviction, which is typically a minor offense that may not significantly impact future behavior but could indicate ongoing criminal history concerns.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (No use in past four years)\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use correlates with lower risk of reoffending due to decreased substance abuse triggers.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Not married, not living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living situation may influence support and stability, but without specific issues, this is a neutral factor.\"),\n    (\"Education (High school diploma, not in college)\", \"low\", \"Formal education can be a positive indicator of future stability if applied appropriately.\"),\n    (\"Employment (One job during the year)\", \"high\", \"Stable employment may reduce the need for criminal activity but could also limit opportunities for positive growth.\"),\n    (\"Household Size (Living with biological mother, household size 6 in urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Larger households can sometimes lead to less supervision or stress, which might be a risk factor depending on the family dynamics.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (No depression in past month)\", \"low\", \"Stable mental health contributes positively to overall well-being and adherence to legal obligations.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (Believes in God)\", \"high\", \"Religious support can aid in moral accountability but may also impose rigid values that could restrict personal growth if not aligned with positive life choices.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
