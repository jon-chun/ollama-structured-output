Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a Bachelor's degree and is in graduate school. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and higher earnings, which might deter her from engaging in criminal activities. So that's probably low risk.\n\nShe's not married and living alone. Unstable living situations are often linked to higher recidivism rates because they might lack support systems or face challenges like substance abuse. That could be medium risk.\n\nShe uses marijuana occasionally but had a bad experience recently where she felt really down, which might indicate she's struggling with mental health issues or substance use that's affecting her. That's another red flag for medium risk.\n\nHer background is interesting\u2014she lived in a household of four at a young age in a rural area. That could mean she was exposed to family dynamics or environmental factors that might influence her behavior, but it's not directly tied to criminal behavior. Still, maybe low or medium.\n\nShe believes in God and sees Him as part of her life. This is more about her personal beliefs rather than behavior, so probably no direct impact on recidivism risk\u2014maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: education is a strong protective factor (low), living situation and substance use are moderate factors (medium each). So I'd lean towards medium overall but with some mitigating factors from her education. Maybe the prediction would be lower than high, so perhaps 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in graduate school, which can positively influence her stability and future earnings, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a stable family support system may increase stress and substance use issues, contributing to potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \" occasional marijuana use combined with recent feelings of low mood suggests possible substance abuse impacting her mental health or behavior.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"low\", \"Exposure at a young age in a household of four doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but may indicate family dynamics affecting her indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God is likely unrelated to criminal behavior, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
