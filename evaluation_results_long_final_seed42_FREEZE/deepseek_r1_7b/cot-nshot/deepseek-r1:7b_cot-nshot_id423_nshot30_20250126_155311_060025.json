    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old male who's White. He has twoConvictions, which is a pretty high risk factor. His weight is 5'5\" and 155 lbs\u2014though that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so no support system which could help him get back on track after incarceration. No HS diploma or GED means he has limited education, which can hinder his chances of finding a job and getting betterment opportunities.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year\u2014so some work experience is good, but if those were low-paying or unstable, that might not compensate for other factors.\n\nUsing drugs like marijuana and cocaine is serious. Substance abuse often leads to more crime after release because he might struggle with addiction and could end up reoffending.\n\nHe's feeling down a lot of the time\u2014emotional distress can affect his motivation and ability to reintegrate into society, increasing the risk of recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of four. That suggests he grew up in a potentially unstable environment, which might have had long-term effects on his behavior or self-esteem.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his personal events could indicate a lack of free will or responsibility, which isn't necessarily bad but might influence how he copes with stress and challenges after being rearrested.\n\nPutting all these factors together: twoConvictions are already a strong indicator of high risk. Drug use, emotional distress, limited education, living alone, and unstable family environment all contribute to a higher chance of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"twoConvictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism as they indicate past criminal behavior which can predict future criminality.\"),\n    (\"drugUse\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for reoffending.
