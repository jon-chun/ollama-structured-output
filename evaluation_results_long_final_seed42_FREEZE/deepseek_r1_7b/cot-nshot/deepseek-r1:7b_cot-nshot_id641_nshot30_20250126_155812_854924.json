    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by listing out all the risk factors mentioned in the problem.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested once and was convicted. That's one risk factor\u2014arrests and convictions. Since she has one conviction, that's moderately significant but not a major red flag yet.\n\nShe weighs 120 lbs and is 5 feet 8 inches tall. Her weight might be on the lower end for her height, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to recidivism. Maybe it's more about health issues, which could affect rearrest rates, but without specific health information, I can't say for sure.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because she might have fewer social support networks, but in this case, since she's single, that might actually increase the risk of substance abuse or other issues leading to rearrest.\n\nShe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is generally considered positive as it shows educational attainment, which can lead to better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates. However, not being enrolled in college could indicate she's seeking further education but hasn't started yet, so maybe that's a medium risk.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences is usually a good sign because it shows financial stability and responsibility. Three jobs are quite a few for someone her age, so this might actually be a protective factor, reducing the risk of recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and feels down sometimes. Substance abuse can definitely lead to rearrest, but she hasn't used drugs recently, which is positive. However, feeling down or experiencing low mood without substance use could be related to mental health issues, which might affect her ability to reintegrate into society, possibly increasing recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Sharing living with family can provide emotional support and stability, which is usually protective against recidivism. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates or stressors that could affect someone's well-being, but since she was with her own mother, that might mitigate some of those risks.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. That indicates a lack of religious support system, which can be a risk factor because having a strong support network can help navigate through challenges and reduce recidivism chances.\n\nPutting this all together: She has one conviction (moderate), living alone (could be a risk), no drug use but mood issues (maybe medium risk), GED (protective), three jobs (proTECTIVE), no recent substance abuse, but considering lack of religious support. \n\nI think the factors that would influence her rearrest are the single living situation and lack of religious support, which might increase her risk slightly. The multiple job history and GED should help mitigate that.\n\nSo my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level around 60%. She has some risk factors but also protective ones like education, employment, and not being in a relationship.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior conviction can indicate past behavior that might influence future decisions. Moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally associated with lower recidivism rates due to reduced dependency on substance abuse or other negative factors.
