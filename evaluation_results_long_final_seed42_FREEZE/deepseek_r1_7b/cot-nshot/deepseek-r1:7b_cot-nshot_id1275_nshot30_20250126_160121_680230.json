    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old Hispanic female. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she has a prior arrest and conviction. In the examples, having a prior offense significantly increases the risk of recidivism. So that's a high weight factor because it directly correlates with rearrest.\n\nShe's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 160 lbs. The examples don't specify height or weight as factors, but in general, these aren't major factors unless there's associated issues like substance use, which she does have here. So maybe this is a low weight factor compared to others.\n\nShe never married and lives alone. Living alone can be risky, especially if she's not surrounded by support networks, so that's another high weight risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Educational attainment is usually a protective factor, but without it, it might increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors. So this could be a medium to high weight factor depending on context.\n\nNot enrolled in college and only held one job during the year. Job stability can affect recidivism; being unemployed or underemployed might lead to more substance use or other issues. So that's probably a high weight factor.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a clear risk factor, especially if it's been ongoing. This definitely has a high weight because drug use can impede job performance and increase risk of further offenses.\n\nNot felt depressed over the past month. Lack of mental health support might lead to substance misuse or other risky behaviors. So this could be a medium weight factor.\n\nAt a young age, lived with her biological mother in a household of 3. Small family size isn't inherently bad, but living with a parent can provide stability depending on how it was done. If the environment wasn't supportive, it might still be a medium to high risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events (God factor). This is subjective and varies widely; some people's spirituality can help, others not so much. It might have a low weight as it's less directly tied to recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (high), drug use (high), lack of education (medium high), living alone (high), job issues (high). The God factor is mixed but probably doesn't tip the scale. So overall, she seems to have multiple high risk factors that would predict a 'YES' for 3-year rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"She has a prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the risk of recidivism as seen in similar cases where individuals with such history often reoffend within three years.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Her height (5 feet 8 inches) and weight (160 lbs) do not directly correlate with recidivism unless accompanied by substance abuse or other factors which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"single_parent_living\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase the risk of substance abuse, unstable relationships, or other risky behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_investment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can affect job opportunities and stability, potentially leading to substance use or other risky activities which are precursors to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job_status\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job during the year may contribute to financial instability, which could lead to increased substance use or other unstable behaviors that may result in rearrest.\"), \n    (\"drug Use Past 4 years\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor for substance abuse, which can impede job performance and lead to further criminal behavior within three years.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_state\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month may indicate some level of mental health concern that could influence substance use or other risky behaviors, though it's not a direct indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household_size_living_with_biological_mother\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of 3 can provide certain stabilizing effects depending on the nature of the living arrangement and support provided by the family.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
