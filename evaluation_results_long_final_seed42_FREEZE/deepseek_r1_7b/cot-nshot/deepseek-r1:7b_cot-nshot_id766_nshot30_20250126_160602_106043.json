    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on the provided risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and categorizing them as low, medium, or high weight.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who is White. She's been arrested once and has been convicted. Her age might be relevant because younger individuals sometimes have different recidivism rates, but since she's 22, which is relatively young, I'm not sure yet how that affects it.\n\nShe weighs 155 lbs, which seems within a normal range. Her marital status is married, and she's living with her spouse. Marital stability can be a protective factor, so this might lower the risk of rearrest.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism; having a diploma is positive, but not continuing education might indicate some disengagement or higher risk if she finds other opportunities.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Employment, especially with previous convictions, can be a mitigating factor as it shows responsibility and commitment to her current situation.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: she has used marijuana. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this could increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Being depressed might correlate with substance abuse or other issues that can lead to further problems.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Living with multiple family members and in a rural setting could have various implications\u2014perhaps more support but also potential isolation depending on the environment.\n\nShe considers God as part of her personal belief system. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide emotional support or structure that might positively influence behavior, though it's not always directly linked to recidivism.\n\nNow, applying these factors with their respective weights:\n\n- High School Diploma: Medium weight because education is important but not the highest factor.\n- Number of Jobs: High since having two jobs can indicate stability and ability to manage responsibilities.\n- Marital Status: High because being married and living with her spouse suggests strong support and lower risk.\n- Weight: Low because it's a standard body weight, doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless combined with other factors like drug use.\n- Drug Use (marijuana): Medium high since even occasional use can increase the risk of further substance abuse or related issues.\n\nConsidering all these, the high weight factors include education, marital status, and number of jobs. The medium high factor is her drug use. The low factors are age, weight, and belief in God. Combining these, she has some positive mitigating factors but also a known risk from drug use. Her previous conviction adds to the risk as well.\n\nPutting this together, I think she might have a slightly higher risk due to the drug use and prior conviction, despite her stable marital situation and education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma\", \"medium\", \"This individual has a high school diploma, which can positively influence recidivism risk by providing educational stability.
