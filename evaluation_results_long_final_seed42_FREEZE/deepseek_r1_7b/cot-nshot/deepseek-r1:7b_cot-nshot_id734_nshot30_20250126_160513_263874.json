    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male who's White. Let me break down his risk factors based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, he has a high number of arrests\u20144 times\u2014and convictions. From the examples, people with multiple arrests tend to have higher recidivism rates. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 215 lbs. In the examples, weight was mentioned as a factor for some cases, but it wasn't always a determining factor. However, his weight is above average, which might indicate more responsibility or perhaps substance use issues, so maybe medium to high risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating and may contribute to negative emotions. The example with someone living alone had some recidivism, though not always. So this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but enrolled in 2-year college. Completion of higher education is usually protective against recidivism, so this might actually lower the risk slightly.\n\nHe's never held a job and used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, has been linked to increased recidivism rates because it can lead to other criminal behaviors or substance abuse problems. So that's high risk.\n\nHis young age\u201421\u2014is typically when people start making decisions; maybe he's still developing, so could be a medium risk factor. But if he's in college and enrolled, perhaps there's some stability which might mitigate this.\n\nHe's lived in a household of size 6. Larger households sometimes have more support systems, but it also depends on the dynamics. In one example with a similar household size, recidivism was low because he had a supportive family, but here, since he's living alone and never married, maybe it's less supportive. So medium risk.\n\nConsidering his belief that God has no role in his personal events might indicate some resilience, but if he's feeling down due to drug use or other issues, this could affect his mental health which is a contributing factor. However, this belief isn't directly tied to recidivism stats, so maybe it doesn't add much risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), substance use (high), living alone and isolation (medium), education level might be protective but not enough to lower the overall risk. The belief in God might help him cope, but if he's struggling mentally due to drug use, that could increase his vulnerability.\n\nI think the high number of arrests is a strong indicator pointing towards recidivism. Even though some factors like living alone are medium, the multiple past convictions and current substance use would likely lead to a higher risk. So my prediction leans towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4 times) indicate a history of criminal behavior which is a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with increased likelihood of rearrest as it can lead to additional criminal activities or other behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"living_alone_and_isolation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and feeling isolated may contribute to negative emotional states which could increase the risk of self-harm or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but enrolled in college might suggest some level of stability, though it's not directly tied to higher recidivism rates compared to lower education levels.\"),\n    (\"past_joblessness\", \"low\", \"Not holding a job may indicate financial instability or focus on other areas which could be protective against certain types of recidivism, though it doesn't guarantee protection in all aspects.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
