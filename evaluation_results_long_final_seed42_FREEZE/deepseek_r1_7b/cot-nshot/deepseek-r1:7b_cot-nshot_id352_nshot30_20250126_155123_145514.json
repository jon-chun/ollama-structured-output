    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person is a 22-year-old male who's White, has been arrested twice and convicted, stands at 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 190 lbs, never married living alone, with a high school diploma enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job, no drug use, not depressed recently. At his young age, he lived with others besides his biological parents in an urban area of size 4, and believes God has no influence on his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the risk factors from the provided examples to see how they relate to recidivism outcomes. Each factor is given a weight (low, medium, high) based on its impact.\n\n1. **Arrests and Convictions**: High. Having two arrests and a conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism.\n2. **Age**: Medium. Being 22 isn't too old but not young either, which might influence reoffending rates.\n3. **Weight**: Medium. At 190 lbs, he's above average; could be a health risk factor.\n4. **Marital Status and Housing Stability**: Low. Living alone with no spouse or partner suggests possible instability, but since it's not a conviction, maybe medium? Wait, no, the examples showed that living with biological parents had high recidivism for some. Here he's with others, so perhaps lower risk.\n5. **Education Level**: Medium. High school diploma is average; college enrollment might slightly mitigate but not drastically.\n6. **Employment History**: Low. Holding one job isn't a strong indicator of future stability unless it's related to substance use or other factors.\n7. **Drug Use**: None, so very low risk for drug-related recidivism.\n8. **Mental Health**: None, which is good, as mental health issues often predict recidivism.\n9. **Family History and Environment**: High. Living with non-biological parents in an urban area of size 4 could indicate instability or exposure to negative influences.\n\nPutting it all together: High on arrests and family environment; medium for age, weight, marital status, education, employment, low for drug use and mental health. The combination suggests a higher risk but not certain. The examples show that people with multiple convictions and living in unstable environments tend towards high recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice, which is a significant factor indicating past criminal behavior and potential for future arrests.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted adds to the risk as it shows past legal issues which can impact future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"Standing at 190 lbs may pose health risks that could influence recidivism, but not definitively high or low.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Housing Stability\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse indicates some level of instability, which might slightly increase risk but is mitigated by other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college may suggest some stability, but it's not a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job for the past year does not indicate a clear pattern of stable employment which could correlate with lower risk of reemployment after release.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"none\", \"No drug use history reduces the risk associated with substance abuse, which is often linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"none\", \"Not experiencing depression reduces mental health risks that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area may indicate exposure to environmental factors associated with higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
