    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White female. Let's break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a solid medium risk because prior convictions are a clear indicator of recidivism. I remember from the examples that having even two prior convictions can significantly increase the chance of rearrest.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs, which is below the weight category for low risk in many studies. Since she falls into a lower weight category, her body type might not be a big factor here, but maybe her health could play a role later on.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse\u2014marital stability usually reduces recidivism risk because being in a committed relationship can provide support and reduce stressors. So this should probably have a low impact on her risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which is a medium to high risk factor. Education levels are strongly linked to lower recidivism rates, so not having that could make her more likely to reoffend.\n\nShe held one job during the year\u2014that's better than no jobs but still not ideal. Job experience can help with stability and financial management, so this should be a medium factor.\n\nHer substance use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because drug use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. Using both substances indicates she might have ongoing substance abuse issues, which is high risk.\n\nThe most telling part is that during the past month, she felt extremely down almost all the time. Emotional distress can lead to impulsive behaviors and increased risk of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high-risk indicator because chronic emotional issues often precede recidivism.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Being raised by her mother, especially in a rural setting, might have its pros (like a strong support system) but could also present challenges depending on the dynamics. However, since she's now married, maybe those issues are less pronounced, so perhaps this is a lower risk factor compared to living with an unstable family.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal matters\u2014this could be a protective factor as spirituality can sometimes provide coping mechanisms and guidance, reducing stress and negative emotions. So that might moderate the high risk factors related to emotional distress and substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (medium), no diploma (high), substance abuse (high), chronic emotional distress (high). Marital status and living arrangement with her mother are lower or mitigating factors but not enough to counterbalance the high-risk elements here. The job and being single also don't help much, so they might be low-medium.\n\nSince she has multiple high-risk factors\u2014prior convictions, lack of education, drug use, emotional distress\u2014the prediction should lean towards a high risk of rearrest. Her prior convictions alone suggest she's more likely to reoffend compared to someone without them.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of her risk factors, particularly her prior convictions, substance abuse, and chronic emotional distress, her likelihood of rearrest is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having been convicted twice indicates a history of criminal behavior which increases the chances of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a diploma or GED significantly correlates with higher recidivism rates compared to individuals with higher education.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Marijuana and Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past use of both marijuana and cocaine is strongly associated with increased risk of engaging in criminal activities and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling down almost all the time during the past month is a significant indicator of potential emotional distress, which can lead to impulsive behaviors and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse provides support which may reduce stressors and potentially lower the risk of recidivism compared to living alone or in unstable conditions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
