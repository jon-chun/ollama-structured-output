    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this case step by step to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The person is an 18-year-old female Black, arrested once but not convicted, standing at 5'7\" and weighing 120 lbs. She's single, living alone, has a high school diploma without college enrollment, has had three jobs in the past year, used marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived with both parents in an urban household of four, and believes God plays a role.\n\nFirst, I'll identify each risk factor based on the examples provided. \n\n1. **Arrests**: She's been arrested once but not convicted. In prior cases, non-convicted arrests often don't predict rearrest as strongly as convictions. So this might be low weight.\n\n2. **Age and Education**: Being 18 is a minor age, which typically has lower recidivism rates. High school diploma without college enrollment is considered moderate risk since some studies show higher recidivism among those with less education, but it's not the highest risk factor.\n\n3. **Job History**: She's held three jobs in a year. More stable employment usually reduces recidivism, so this could be low to medium weight depending on context.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana but hasn't had issues leading to further offenses. This is moderate; past drug use can increase risk if it leads to other problems.\n\n5. **Mood/Emotional State**: She feels down often, which might correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or depression, affecting her ability to reintegrate and commit new crimes. This could be medium weight.\n\n6. **Household Environment**: Lived with both parents in a household of four urban setting. Parental presence can offer support but living with multiple family members doesn't necessarily lower risk significantly compared to single parenting.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: She believes God influences her, which is generally protective against criminal behavior, so this might slightly reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Non-convicted arrest (low), age 18 (moderate but not high risk due to being a minor), education level moderate, job history three jobs (low to medium), marijuana use (moderate), mood (medium), living with parents (low), and belief in God (high protective). \n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk seems lower. Since she has a clean record and is relatively young, but other factors like drug use and feeling down could slightly increase it. However, her job history and living situation mitigate some risks. \n\nLooking at prior examples, individuals with similar factors often had outcomes that were NO or maybe YES if other factors pushed them over the edge. Since she's not convicted yet, her chances are better than someone with a conviction. Her positive belief in God is a strong protective factor.\n\nSo, my prediction leans towards NO for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (non-convicted)\", \"low\", \"Non-convicted arrests are generally not strong predictors of recidivism compared to convictions. This person has one non-convicted arrest which is likely a low risk factor but not mitigating enough on its own.\"),\n    (\"Age (18 years old)\", \"low\", \"At 18, she benefits from being a minor with lower recidivism rates. This age does not strongly predict rearrest but leans towards a safer outcome.\"),\n    (\"Job History (3 jobs in past year)\", \"medium\", \"Having three job-related factors (holding, losing, gaining) suggests some instability which could be concerning but is tempered by employment history and current job status.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana use)\", \"moderate\", \" Past marijuana use may increase risk of substance abuse or other issues that could influence rearrest. However, it's not a direct conviction, so the impact is moderate.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Emotional State (feeling down often)\", \"medium\", \"This factor suggests potential for distress which can affect mental health and ability to reintegrate into society, increasing risk slightly but not critically high.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment (living with both parents in urban household of 4)\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents provides support which is generally protective against recidivism despite the urban setting. The size doesn't negate this support completely.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God (has something to do with what happens to her personally)\", \"high\", \"Strong belief in a higher power can be protective, reducing risk of criminal behavior and substance abuse compared to those who don't have such beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
