    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old Black female with specific risk factors. First, I'll list out all her risk factors as provided.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. Her weight is 127 lbs at 5 feet 4 inches, which might not be directly a risk factor unless it's linked to other issues, but in this case, it doesn't seem significant. She's married and living with her spouse, so she's not homeless or experiencing instability there. She has a GED and isn't enrolled in college; having a GED can sometimes positively affect employment prospects, which might be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could indicate poor employability or lack of support network. Not using drugs for four years is a positive indicator of sobriety, which reduces recidivism risk. She's not feeling depressed either, so mental health isn't an issue here.\n\nAt 21, she's quite young, and at this age, many factors might influence her future stability, but being so young might also mean less life experience that could predict issues later on. Living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area\u2014 urban living can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or instability, which is a risk factor.\n\nShe believes in God's role in her life, which some studies suggest can aid in personal resilience but might also indicate potential challenges if she faces issues.\n\nNow, considering each risk factor:\n\n1. **One arrest, no conviction**: Medium risk. An arrest suggests potential for substance abuse or criminal behavior, but without a conviction, it doesn't directly impact her ability to recidivate.\n   \n2. **GED and not enrolled in college**: High risk. While having a GED can sometimes help with job prospects, not being enrolled might indicate lack of commitment or support which could lead to losing employment or support networks.\n\n3. **No jobs held during the year**: Medium risk. Unemployment can strain relationships, cause financial instability, and is a known predictor of recidivism if it leads to substance abuse or further legal issues.\n\n4. **Not using drugs for four years and no depression**: Low risk. Drug use and mental health issues are strong predictors of recidivism when present.\n\n5. **Living with her biological mother in an urban area at age 17**: Medium risk. Urban environments can have higher crime rates or social issues that might affect her ability to reintegrate successfully after being released from prison.\n\n6. **Young age (21)**: Low to medium risk. Young individuals may lack life experience, but it's also a time when they're developing skills and relationships which could mitigate future issues.\n\n7. **Believes in God**: High risk. While spirituality can help, belief without addressing personal challenges might not provide much protection if she faces new challenges.\n\nPutting this all together: She has some mitigating factors like the GED and no drug use, but also factors that are generally higher risk such as living in an urban area, young age, lack of job experience, and being married (but stability there isn't necessarily a risk). The single prior arrest might not be significant enough to tip her into a high-risk category. However, the urban environment where she lives is a potential red flag.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think her overall risk is medium. She's got some positive attributes but also notable risk factors that could influence her likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest without a conviction suggests potential for substance abuse or criminal behavior, which can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"ged_status\", \"high\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college may indicate lack of commitment or support, increasing risk of losing employment or support networks.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year could strain relationships and lead to financial instability, which can be a precursor to further issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_and_mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years and not feeling depressed indicates good sobriety and mental health, reducing risk of substance abuse or mental health issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"residence\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area may correlate with higher crime rates or instability, increasing potential for social challenges that could affect reintegration.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, she is in a phase of life where developing skills and relationships can mitigate future issues, but age alone isn't a definitive risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Believing in God may provide some resilience, but without addressing personal challenges, it might not protect against new challenges leading to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
