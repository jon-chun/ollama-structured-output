    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a high school diploma, which is considered a positive indicator as education can lead to better job opportunities and reduce criminal tendencies. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Being arrested multiple times without a conviction might indicate some reluctance or fear of getting caught again, so this could be low risk.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs at 5'9\", which isn't extremely high, and he's enrolled in school. Education combined with being in school can show commitment to positive change, so that's another low factor.\n\nLiving alone suggests he doesn't have immediate family support, but since he's a recent graduate and attending school, his circumstances are favorable compared to others who might be living with relatives or extended families.\n\nHe uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine) which is a significant risk because substance abuse can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to more criminal behavior. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month is positive; being in a good mental state usually correlates with better behavior and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe's 18 years old, which means he's still developing socially and legally, so this alone might not be too concerning but could be part of his overall profile.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age indicates a stable home environment, which is protective against recidivism. However, being now living alone could be due to personal choice or circumstances that might change, introducing some risk.\n\nConsidering God as a positive force suggests he has strong moral support and values, which can aid in his personal growth and hopefully deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: His education and school enrollment are positives, but the drug use is a major red flag. Despite being 18, which is still early in life, other factors like prior arrests might indicate potential for future issues. The low to medium confidence is because while he has some protective factors, his drug use and lack of immediate family support add significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high school diploma\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma which indicates education and positive outcomes typically leading to better job opportunities and reduced criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"2 arrests, no convictions\", \"low\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions may indicate reluctance or fear of getting caught again.
