    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That alone might not be a huge risk, but considering his other factors, it could play a role. Maybe medium weight since it's one arrest withoutConviction.\n\nHe weighs 185 lbs and is 5'7\". The examples don't specify height as a factor, so maybe no impact here. Probably low or medium, but not sure yet.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014marital status can influence recidivism, but in this case, he's single and never married, which might be a low risk compared to others who have more support structures.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this is a significant factor. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so this should be high weight.\n\nNot enrolled in college\u2014even though he's 19, not attending college can indicate lower self-discipline and higher risk, so another high factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience might help reduce recidivism, so maybe a medium impact because it's positive but not as strong as education or family issues.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014he used marijuana. Drug use can be a strong indicator of future substance abuse which can lead to more issues, so high weight here.\n\nNo feelings of depression over the month\u2014this is actually a good sign, indicating he might be mentally stable enough to not reoffend, but since it's a factor related to current mental health, maybe low impact unless past issues suggest otherwise. But in this case, no mention of depression, so perhaps not directly relevant.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area\u2014family living can provide support and stability. This is probably a low risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal happenings\u2014religion can sometimes correlate with more prosocial behavior or less criminal activity, so maybe medium weight as it's not absolute but could influence outcomes positively or negatively depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together: His lack of education and not being enrolled in college are major red flags. Drug use is another significant risk. The other factors like living with family and no prior convictions might somewhat mitigate the risk. So overall, I think his chances of rearrest are higher but maybe not extremely high. Considering the examples where similar factors were present, sometimes the outcome was NO or YES based on the combination.\n\nI would assign medium weight to each factor because while some are strong indicators (education and employment), others like prior arrest might lower it slightly. Combining these, I'm leaning towards a 60% confidence that he'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The person has one non-convicted arrest which could indicate potential risk but might be mitigated by other factors like living with family and not being married.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED, which significantly increases recidivism risk compared to individuals with higher education levels.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Not currently enrolled in college despite being 19 years old may suggest some level of disengagement which could contribute to recidivism but might not be as significant as lack of education.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known risk factor for substance abuse and potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no ties to a family structure might increase instability but in this case, he lives with his biological mother, providing some support.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental health which could be a positive factor in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five suggests stability and support which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"His belief that God has something to do with his personal happenings might influence his behavior positively or negatively depending on context but doesn't directly correlate strongly with recidivism\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
