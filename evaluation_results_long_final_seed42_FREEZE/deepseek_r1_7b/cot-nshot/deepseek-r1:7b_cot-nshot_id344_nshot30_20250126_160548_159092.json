    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given risk factors for this 20-year-old female White individual and predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which is relatively young but not a major red flag on its own. She has been arrested once but not convicted, so that's a mitigating factor since she hasn't actually received a formal conviction despite being in custody.\n\nHer weight is 180 lbs at 5 feet tall, which doesn't immediately stand out as problematic unless there are issues with her health or substance use, which we'll consider later. She's never married and living alone, so no immediate family support to fall back on during a potential relapse.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate some level of responsibility, though it could also mean she's seeking further education as part of her recovery process.\n\nShe's held 9 jobs within the past year. This is a lot and suggests she's adaptable or perhaps in a field that doesn't involve much substance use. Having multiple job experiences can be beneficial for building skills unrelated to drug use, which might reduce the likelihood of relapse.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Both are highly addictive, especially cocaine, which has severe long-term consequences. Using both substances regularly increases the risk of needing treatment or relapsing, which could impact her ability to stay sober.\n\nThe past four years show she's had a history of drug use (marijuana) but not necessarily cocaine every year. This indicates inconsistent use, which might suggest she's attempting abstinence or cycling through different substances. The fact that she feels down and can't find cheer suggests emotional distress tied to her substance use, possibly leading to more triggers.\n\nAt 5 feet tall with a household size of 5 in a rural area at young age, she experienced living with both parents but in a small household. This might suggest she's close to family, which could be a support system or potentially a strain if there are conflicts, though it's unclear here.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal issues is positive, indicating some level of self-reflection and seeking help, which is a good sign for recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: The high number of past jobs (9) suggests she's proactive. The drug use history, especiallycocaine, is concerning but perhaps she's in treatment now. The current living situation with family might offer support. Her age isn't a risk factor here. She's not enrolled in college, which could mean she's focusing on other areas like work or family.\n\nHowever, the ongoing substance use and feeling down during the past month indicate potential triggers for relapse. The lack of marriage and living alone don't directly correlate with recidivism but could influence her support system. Her arrest history is a point to consider; despite not being convicted, she's still in some form of custody which might reflect on her ability to stay sober.\n\nConsidering all these factors: high drug use (cannabis and cocaine), inconsistent job experience (though many jobs can help), and living alone without family support could be risk factors. The positive aspects like education and current employment might offset, but the drug use is a significant concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which is within a reasonable age range for recidivism prediction.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating no active criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which significantly increases the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"She has held 9 jobs within the last year, showing adaptability but not directly related to substance use risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no family support, which could increase stress and trigger substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, indicating some focus on personal development.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"low\", \"She feels down and struggles to find cheer, potentially indicating increased susceptibility to triggers.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
