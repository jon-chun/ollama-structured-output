    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old male who is White. He's been arrested three times and convicted, which seems like a strong risk factor. His weight is 5 feet 11 inches and 135 lbs, but that doesn't seem directly related to recidivism unless it's about health issues or something else.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone, so he might be in a situation where he has fewer support systems around him, which could increase the chance of reverting to criminal behavior. His lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and not being enrolled in college are also concerning factors because educational attainment is usually linked to better job opportunities and lower recidivism.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences might actually be a positive sign as it shows he can manage different responsibilities, but if those were low-paying or unstable, that could be a risk. However, since he has no recent criminal history beyond being convicted before, maybe his job stability isn't directly tied to recidivism.\n\nHe uses marijuana, which is a drug abuse issue. Drug use can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues, so that's definitely a red flag. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here because depression might be a sign of deeper issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area, which is interesting. Urban environments can have higher crime rates or more stressors, so that could contribute to his criminal history.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal circumstances, which might indicate some level of religious support and possibly better decision-making from a moral standpoint. However, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless he's been using religion as an excuse for bad behavior before.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions (high risk), lack of education and employment stability (medium-high risk), substance abuse (high risk), living in an environment with potential stressors (medium risk). The belief in God might somewhat mitigate some risk, but the other factors are strong indicators.\n\nSo I would predict a high chance of rearrest within three years. I'll give it an 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor and their impact on recidivism, here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **High Risk - Previous Arrests**: The individual has been arrested three times and convicted. This indicates a history of criminal behavior, significantly increasing the likelihood of future rearrest.\n\n2. **Medium Risk - Educational Lack**: Without a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college, this factor suggests limited opportunities for betterment, potentially leading to further involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\n3. **High Risk - Drug Use (Marijuana)**: Drug abuse is strongly correlated with recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities or substance-related issues contributing to future crimes.\n\n4. **Medium Risk - Unstable Living Situation**: Living alone but without a family support network might contribute to isolation, which could increase the risk of reverting to criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Moderate Consideration - Religious Belief**: While belief in God may provide some moral guidance, it does not directly mitigate criminal tendencies unless used constructively.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence Level**: Considering all these factors, particularly the high number of prior convictions, educational gaps, and drug use, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior that significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"educational_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college may limit opportunities for positive development and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug abuse, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with increased recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support might contribute to isolation, potentially increasing the likelihood of reverting criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
