    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, 22 years old, with one arrest but not convicted. He's 5'6\" and weighs 202 lbs. He's never married and living alone. He has a GED and isn't in college. He's held two jobs. Drug use: marijuana past four years, but only some of the time feeling down this month.\n\nAt young age, he lived with both parents in a household size of 10. He believes God affects his personal issues.\n\nLooking at previous examples, let's see how each factor contributes to the risk.\n\nAge: 22 is within typical recidivism window but not too high. Previous arrest could indicate some instability.\n\nArrest count: 1, not convicted\u2014so maybe a minor offense or perhaps non-violent. Not much on this yet.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\"/202 lbs. Maybe doesn't directly relate to risk unless considering behavior or health issues. Probably low impact here.\n\nMarital status: Never married living alone might indicate lower support system, which could be a risk factor but maybe medium.\n\nGED: Holds some value; GEDs can sometimes lead to better job opportunities reducing recidivism, so perhaps it's a mitigating factor\u2014maybe high negative weight if it affects future stability.\n\nEmployment: Not enrolled in college and held 2 jobs. Employment generally reduces recidivism by providing income and stability, but not having a degree might be a risk. Since he has two jobs, maybe medium positive impact.\n\nDrug use: Past marijuana use is a potential risk factor, especially if it affects mood or mental health leading to further issues\u2014so probably high positive weight.\n\nFeeling down: Sometimes being in low moods can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors, contributing to recidivism. That's another risk factor\u2014medium positive.\n\nHousehold size at young age: 10 is quite large and maybe indicative of family dysfunction or neglect, which could be a strong risk factor\u2014high positive weight.\n\nReligion: Believes God affects his life; some studies suggest religion can reduce recidivism by providing moral support. So this might be a mitigating factor but since it's personal belief, perhaps low impact here.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nHigh positive factors (mitigating): GED, two jobs.\nMedium positive: Not married living alone, household size 10.\nHigh positive: Drug use, feeling down.\nNegative: Past arrest, lack of college degree.\n\nBut considering the high risk from household size and drug use, it leans towards higher risk. However, having a GED might offset some of that. The person is young, so maybe lower risk than older cases but still, multiple mitigating factors are present.\n\nI think the overall prediction would lean towards \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which falls within a typical recidivism window and may not inherently be a strong risk factor without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Count\", \"low\", \"One arrest but not convicted could indicate minor or non-violent offenses that might not have significant long-term implications.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse can sometimes suggest a lack of support, which may indirectly contribute to higher risk but isn't directly tied to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Highest Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a GED certificate provides some educational background that might offer better opportunities and reduce future risk, acting as a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled in college despite having held two jobs suggests some employment experience which can contribute to stability but isn't directly tied to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use and feelings of low mood can indicate potential substance abuse or mental health issues, both significant contributors to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Admission\", \"high\", \"Living with both parents in a household of 10 suggests possible family dysfunction which is strongly associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has an influence on personal issues may provide some moral support, but this is a personal belief and doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk metrics.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
