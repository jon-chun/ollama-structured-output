    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The person is an 18-year-old male who's White, has been arrested 3 times with a prior conviction, weighs 140 lbs at 5 feet 10 inches, living alone without a spouse, enrolled in school, worked one job, used marijuana, and feels sometimes down.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor step by step. \n\n1. **Previous Incarcerment**: He has 3 prior arrests with a conviction. That's a high risk because more convictions usually mean worse recidivism.\n2. **Age**: He's 18, which is still young, but since he's been arrested multiple times, his age alone might not be the main factor here.\n3. **Weight and Height**: 5'10\" and 140 lbs. Not sure how significant this is unless it relates to other factors like physical labor or health issues.\n4. **Living Situation**: He's living alone with no spouse. Living alone can sometimes mean less support, but if he's stable in that environment, maybe not as high a risk.\n5. **Education**: He's enrolled in school. Education typically reduces recidivism, so this is a mitigating factor.\n6. **Employment**: He held 1 job during the year. Employment is usually positive for reducing reoffending.\n7. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana and feels sometimes down. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to unstable behavior or substance abuse issues, which might increase rearrest chances.\n8. **Living with Biological Mother in Urban Area**: Living with a family member could provide support and stability, reducing risk.\n\nPutting this all together: His high number of prior arrests (3) is the biggest red flag. Even though he's got some mitigating factors like education and employment, the previous convictions push him towards higher recidivism. The fact that he feels down might be related to substance use or personal issues, which can contribute to more problematic behavior in the future.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I would predict a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Incarcerments\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 3 times with a prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 18 years old, the individual is still in a relatively early stage of life, but this factor alone does not strongly influence rearrest risk without considering other factors like previous convictions and current circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Weight/Height\", \"low\", \"The individual's weight (140 lbs) at 5'10\\\" may indicate physical labor or health issues that could be mitigated with appropriate support, but this factor alone is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse does not inherently increase the risk of recidivism if the individual is stable in their living situation and has access to support services like school and employment.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in school may indicate a desire for betterment, which could positively influence recidivism risk compared to similar individuals without educational pursuits.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Held 1 job during the year, which is generally a positive indicator of stability and self-sufficiency that can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, with some downward feelings indicating potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to unstable behavior or increased rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Mother in Urban Area\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area, which may provide emotional and physical support, reducing the risk of experiencing high stress or instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
