These factors have limited or no proven correlation with recidivism.\n* **Medium Weight Factors:** Prior convictions, marital status, mental health, employment history. These factors demonstrate some association with increased risk but are not definitive predictors.\n* **High Weight Factors:**  None in this case.\n\nThe overall prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of 60%. This means there is a 60% probability that the individual will not be rearrested within three years based on the provided information. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **This is a simplified example.** Real-world risk assessments involve more complex algorithms and consider a wider range of factors, including offense severity, criminal history details, and other contextual information.\n* **Risk assessment tools should be used responsibly and ethically.** They are not infallible and should not be the sole basis for decisions that impact individuals' lives. \n* **Bias in risk assessment tools is a serious concern.** It's crucial to regularly evaluate and mitigate bias to ensure fairness and equity in the criminal justice system.",
