In this case, the person is only 18 years old, which may make her more vulnerable to reoffending but is still young enough to change her behavior.\n* Gender (medium): There is limited research on the relationship between gender and recidivism, so it can be assigned a medium weight. In this case, the person identifies as Hispanic, but this does not necessarily affect her risk of reoffending.\n* Height and weight (low): These factors are not directly related to recidivism, so they can be assigned a low weight.\n* Marital status and education (high): These factors can be beneficial in reducing the likelihood of reoffending by providing stability and opportunities for personal growth. In this case, the person is married and enrolled in school, which suggests that she may be taking steps to improve her life.\n* Employment history (low): This factor is not directly related to recidivism, so it can be assigned a low weight.\n* Drug use and depression (low): These factors are not relevant in this case, as the person has not used drugs in the past four years and does not report feeling depressed over the past month.\n* Early life environment (medium): This factor may be important in understanding the person's background and potential risk factors, but it is still somewhat speculative. In this case, the person lived in an urban area at a young age, which may have increased her exposure to negative influences.\n* Spirituality (medium): This factor can be beneficial in reducing the likelihood of reoffending by providing a sense of purpose and direction. However, it is still somewhat speculative and cannot be assigned a high weight based on the limited information provided.\nBased on these risk factors, the person's 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 90%. This means that there is a relatively low likelihood that she will reoffend in the next three years.",
