She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
