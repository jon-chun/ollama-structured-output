The individual is young (21 years old), which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders.\n2. He has only been arrested once and not convicted, suggesting a limited criminal history.\n3. His physical attributes (height and weight) do not present any significant risk factors.\n4. His marital status (never married) does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n5. He lives alone, which can sometimes indicate less family support or instability but may also suggest independence and self-reliance.\n6. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, indicating educational stability and future potential.\n7. He has held one job during the year, suggesting employment stability.\n8. His past drug use (marijuana) does not necessarily predict violent or repeat offenses, especially considering his current non-depressed state.\n9. His upbringing in a two-parent household in a rural area is often associated with lower risk factors.\n10. His religious belief (God has something to do with what happens to him personally) can sometimes correlate with reduced recidivism rates, as it may promote moral and ethical values.\n\nHowever, the confidence in this prediction is relatively low due to the limited information provided about his criminal history and personal circumstances. This assessment should be updated with additional data if available.",
