The individual is young, has no history of drug use or depression, and has not been convicted of any crime. His employment history is limited but stable. Living in a rural area with his family at a young age could suggest stability. However, the lack of a high school diploma and college enrollment might indicate lower socioeconomic status, which can be associated with higher risk. The religious belief does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Overall, given these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
