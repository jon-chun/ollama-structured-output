His arrest history is moderate (2 times) but conviction history is not specified as severe or violent. He has held multiple jobs, which could suggest adaptability rather than instability. His educational background and college enrollment are positive indicators. The absence of drug use in the past four years and occasional feelings of sadness do not suggest high risk for recidivism or violence. Living with both parents in a household of size 5 during childhood, currently living alone, and considering God's role in personal life are neutral factors that do not strongly predict high risk. Therefore, based on these factors, the prediction is low to moderate risk.",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
