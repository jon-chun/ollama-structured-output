    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low risk profile for several reasons. First, the individual's age (20 years old) is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders. Second, her criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, indicating minimal prior involvement in criminal activity. Third, her employment history shows she has held multiple jobs within a year, suggesting stability and responsibility. Fourth, the absence of depression symptoms over the past month reduces the likelihood of mental health-related risk factors contributing to reoffending. Lastly, living with her biological mother during formative years in an urban area may not significantly impact current risk levels, especially given her positive college enrollment and employment status.\n\nHowever, there are a few potential risk factors that warrant consideration:\n1. Her drug use (marijuana) over the past four years could potentially indicate substance abuse issues, which might increase recidivism risk if not addressed properly.\n2. The lack of marital status and living alone could suggest instability in her personal life, although this factor's significance is less clear without additional context.\n3. Her religious beliefs might have a protective effect against criminal behavior, but the impact on risk assessment is not definitively established.\n\nOverall, considering these factors and their individual weights, the prediction of high risk seems unlikely in this case. However, it's essential to note that this analysis relies on the provided information and may be influenced by potential omissions or inaccuracies. A comprehensive assessment would require more detailed data and professional judgment.",
