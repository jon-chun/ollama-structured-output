    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low-risk individual for several reasons:\n1. Age: Being young (22 years old) generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders.\n2. Arrest history: Only one arrest without conviction suggests that the person may not have a history of criminal behavior.\n3. Employment: Having held 1 job during the year indicates current employment, which is often associated with lower recidivism rates.\n4. Drug use: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) does not necessarily indicate high risk if there are no ongoing issues or addiction. The fact that he has not felt depressed over the past month suggests a stable mental state.\n5. Marital status: Being unmarried and living alone may not directly impact recidivism rates, but it could suggest independence and self-sufficiency.\n6. Education: Having completed high school education indicates a level of cognitive ability that is associated with lower risk.\n7. Family background: Growing up in an urban area with a large household may indicate exposure to certain environmental factors, but the absence of ongoing family issues suggests stability. The person's belief in God could also imply a sense of personal responsibility and moral values.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that this analysis is based on limited information and does not account for potential confounding variables or nuances in the individual's background. A comprehensive risk assessment would require more detailed data and professional judgment.",
