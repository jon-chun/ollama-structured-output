His age, ethnicity, marital status, education level, employment status, and early family environment do not necessarily indicate high risk on their own. However, when combined with the other factors, they contribute to a higher risk assessment. The confidence level is 70% due to the significant impact of past arrests and depressive symptoms on recidivism rates.",
