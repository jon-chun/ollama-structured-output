Although the individual has a history of drug use and reported feelings of depression, these factors alone do not necessarily indicate high risk. Additionally, the person's age (19), low number of arrests (1), education level (high school diploma and college enrollment), employment history (3 jobs in the year), and positive family background (lived with both parents) are generally associated with lower risk. The fact that he identifies as Black may introduce potential racial bias, but for this analysis, we focus on individual risk factors rather than demographic characteristics. Therefore, based on these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a low confidence score due to the limited information provided.",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year.
