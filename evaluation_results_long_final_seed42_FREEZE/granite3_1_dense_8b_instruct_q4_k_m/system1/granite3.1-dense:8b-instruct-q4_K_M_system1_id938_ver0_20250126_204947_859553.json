His employment history suggests some level of work engagement despite his age. The absence of depression symptoms and recent drug use (marijuana) are also positive indicators. However, the lack of a high school diploma or college enrollment, coupled with a history of living in an urban area and a household of four, could potentially indicate higher risk. The fact that he identifies himself as Black might introduce racial bias considerations, but for this analysis, we focus on the provided risk factors only. Given these factors, the prediction is made with moderate confidence.",
