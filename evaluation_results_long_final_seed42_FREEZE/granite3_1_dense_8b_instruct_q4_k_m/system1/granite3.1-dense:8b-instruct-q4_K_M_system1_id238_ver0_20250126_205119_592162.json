Multiple arrests (3 times) before conviction, which can suggest a higher propensity for criminal behavior.\n2. Lack of education and not being enrolled in college may correlate with lower socio-economic status and limited opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\n3. Limited employment history (only 1 job held in the past year) can be a sign of instability and increased vulnerability to criminal activities.\n4. Substance use, specifically marijuana, can be associated with higher recidivism rates among offenders.\n5. Feeling persistently sad or depressed (symptoms of depression) may indicate mental health issues that could affect judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n6. Growing up in a household of 8 suggests possible exposure to family instability, poverty, or violence, which can contribute to higher risk factors.\n7. Belief in divine intervention (God having something to do with personal events) may indicate less personal responsibility for one's actions, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending.",
