They also do not report feeling depressed, which can be a risk factor for criminal behavior. However, their substance use (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern. Their age, living alone, lack of education or job training, and small household size at a young age could potentially increase risk. The belief in divine intervention might suggest some level of moral or ethical framework, which could mitigate risk. Overall, the confidence in this prediction is moderate due to the presence of concerning factors but also the absence of more severe indicators.",
