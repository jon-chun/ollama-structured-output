Although the individual has not used drugs recently, the past use of substances can be indicative of higher risk behavior. Living with an extended family in an urban area during childhood may also contribute to increased risk, although this factor is less significant than others listed. The individual's belief that God has nothing to do with personal experiences does not directly impact risk assessment but could reflect a lack of social support networks or religious-based coping mechanisms.",
