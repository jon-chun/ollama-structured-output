    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided do not indicate a high level of risk for recidivism. Here's why:\n\n1. Age and Gender: Being a young female generally correlates with lower risk, as younger individuals and females typically have less history of criminal behavior than older males.\n2. Arrests and Convictions: While she has been arrested once and convicted, the frequency of these events is not high enough to indicate significant risk.\n3. Employment History: Holding multiple jobs within a year might suggest instability, but it's not a strong predictor of recidivism on its own.\n4. Education: Being enrolled in college indicates motivation for personal development and potential employment opportunities, which can reduce risk.\n5. Drug Use: Past marijuana use is less concerning than harder drugs or recent use.\n6. Depression: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests emotional stability, a protective factor against recidivism.\n7. Family Background: Living with her biological mother in a rural area and having grown up in a small household could indicate a stable upbringing, which is generally associated with lower risk.\n\nThe main factors that could potentially increase risk are her arrest history and employment instability, but these are not severe enough to outweigh the protective factors present. Therefore, based on the information given, this individual is predicted to have a low-to-medium risk of recidivism.",
