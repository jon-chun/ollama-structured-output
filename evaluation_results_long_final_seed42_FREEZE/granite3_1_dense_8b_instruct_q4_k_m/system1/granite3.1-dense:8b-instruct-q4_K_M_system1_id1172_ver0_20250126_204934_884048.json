    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. The individual's age (19) is below the average age of offenders, and his race does not correlate with higher crime rates in general. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which suggests a lower recidivism risk compared to individuals with multiple offenses.\n\nHis physical attributes (height and weight) are within normal ranges, and his marital status and living situation do not present significant risk factors. Although he has a GED rather than a high school diploma, this does not inherently indicate a higher risk for criminal behavior. His lack of employment is a concern but is balanced by the fact that he has not been convicted of any crimes related to theft or violence.\n\nHis past drug use (marijuana) is not associated with high levels of recidivism, and his recent depression-free state is a positive factor in risk assessment. Living in a four-person household at a young age could indicate stability or support, which may lower risk. His religious belief suggesting personal involvement of God in life events does not typically correlate with increased criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, due to the limited information provided and the absence of factors that strongly predict recidivism, confidence in this assessment is moderate (60). Further details regarding his social environment, psychological state, and specific nature of the previous offense would improve risk prediction accuracy.",
