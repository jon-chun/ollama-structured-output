However, holding four jobs within a year could suggest instability in employment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana) is noted but not recent or indicative of severe substance abuse issues.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors:** Absence of depression over the past month and belief in personal destiny through divine influence could suggest psychological resilience, which may mitigate risk.\n\n6. **Family and Social Structure:** Living alone and having a small household at a young age might indicate limited social support, but it is not necessarily indicative of high risk without additional negative factors.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risk indicators (multiple arrests, job instability), the presence of educational pursuits and lack of recent substance abuse or psychological distress suggest a moderate to low level of risk. The confidence in this assessment is moderate due to the mixed nature of these factors.",
