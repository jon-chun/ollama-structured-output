Thus, an 85% confidence level reflects a strong but not infallible prediction.",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He is separated and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
