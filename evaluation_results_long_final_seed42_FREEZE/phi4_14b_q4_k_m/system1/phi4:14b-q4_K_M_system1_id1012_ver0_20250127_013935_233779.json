These factors often correlate with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and social support.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) suggests potential ongoing substance abuse issues, which can contribute to increased risk.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Experiencing persistent feelings of depression could impair judgment and increase vulnerability to engaging in risky behaviors or criminal activities.\n\n- **Living Situation:** Living alone without strong social support networks may exacerbate the impact of other risk factors.\n\n- **Age and Demographics:** While age is a protective factor, other demographic elements (e.g., racial identity) might intersect with systemic issues affecting recidivism risks differently.\n\nGiven these combined factors, there's a moderate to high likelihood that these indicators suggest an increased risk, hence the prediction \"YES\" with 75% confidence. The confidence level reflects the complexity and interplay of various risk factors without specific data on their exact weights in this scenario.",
