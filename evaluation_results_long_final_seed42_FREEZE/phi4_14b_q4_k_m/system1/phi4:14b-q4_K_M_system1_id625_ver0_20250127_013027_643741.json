His age, while on the younger side for potential criminal involvement, is coupled with positive engagement in education and stable employment (albeit limited to one job). The absence of drug use in recent years and a lack of reported depression further reduce indicators of potential risk behavior. Additionally, his spiritual belief may contribute positively to decision-making processes. Although there is an arrest record without conviction, this alone does not constitute high risk, especially given the other positive factors. However, it's important to note that while these elements suggest a lower risk, they do not entirely eliminate the possibility of future issues, hence the confidence level of 85%.",
