Lack of education (no high school diploma or GED) and unemployment further compound socioeconomic vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Arrest Record:** An arrest without conviction is not a strong predictor on its own, but it does indicate interaction with law enforcement.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Expressions of persistent sadness (\"down in the dumps\") suggest potential mental health issues, which can be significant risk factors if untreated or unaddressed.\n\n- **Living Situation and Background:** Living alone without stable support systems (no marriage, no employment) can increase vulnerability. A history with foster care may indicate past instability.\n\n- **Belief System:** Disconnection from religious belief might suggest a lack of supportive community or personal coping mechanisms, though this is not a direct risk factor on its own.\n\nGiven these factors, particularly the socioeconomic vulnerabilities and mental health concerns, there's a moderate to high level of concern regarding potential future risks. However, without more specific information (e.g., nature of arrest, specifics of mental health status), absolute certainty cannot be achieved. Thus, confidence is set at 75%.",
