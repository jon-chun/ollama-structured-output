The lack of employment over the past year may be due to being a full-time student, which can mitigate concerns about this factor.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but no current drug use is indicated, reducing immediate risk associated with substance abuse.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: He has not felt depressed recently, indicating stable mental health in the short term.\n\n8. **Family and Upbringing**: Growing up in a household of six in an urban area may have presented challenges, but he lived with both biological parents, which can be a stabilizing factor.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: His belief that God has something to do with his life suggests some level of personal reflection or moral guidance.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., prior conviction, drug use), many mitigating factors suggest he is not at high risk for future criminal behavior. The confidence in this prediction is moderate given the limited data and the potential for change in young adults.",
