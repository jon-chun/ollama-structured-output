Education is often associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n4. **Employment**: Holding one job during the year shows some level of stability, though not extensive employment history.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern; however, there is no recent indication of substance abuse problems affecting current behavior.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: No reported depression in the past month suggests stable mental health, reducing risk factors related to recidivism.\n\n7. **Family Background**: Growing up with both biological parents in a moderate-sized household provides some stability and support during formative years.\n\n8. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God influences personal outcomes may suggest a framework for personal accountability and moral behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., past drug use), the positive indicators such as educational attainment, current enrollment in college, stable mental health, and lack of recent substance abuse contribute to a lower overall risk assessment. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the mixed nature of these factors but leaning towards a more favorable outlook.",
