However, occasional feelings are common and do not necessarily indicate a high risk without further details on severity or frequency.\n\n- **Family Background:** Growing up in a stable household with both biological parents in a rural area is generally considered protective against criminal behavior.\n\n- **Religious Belief:** Her belief that God has something to do with her life may provide personal guidance and support, which can be protective.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., occasional depression), the balance of mitigating factors such as education, employment, and family background suggests a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of mental health concerns, though they appear not severe based on available information.",
