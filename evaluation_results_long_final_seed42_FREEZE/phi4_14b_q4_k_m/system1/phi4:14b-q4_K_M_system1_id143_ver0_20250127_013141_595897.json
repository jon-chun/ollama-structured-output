However, holding 4 jobs in a year suggests instability, which could contribute to stress and potential risk factors.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance use issues, which are significant risk factors for criminal behavior and mental health problems.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: Experiencing feelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") is a critical risk factor that can influence decision-making and increase vulnerability to engaging in risky behaviors or reoffending.\n\n7. **Upbringing**: Growing up in an urban environment with both biological parents might provide some stability, but it does not negate other risk factors present.\n\n8. **Religious Belief**: A lack of belief in a higher power providing personal guidance might influence moral decision-making and support systems, though this is more subjective.\n\nOverall, the combination of substance use, mental health issues, employment instability, and living situation suggests a moderate to high risk, hence the \"YES\" prediction with 65% confidence.",

She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
