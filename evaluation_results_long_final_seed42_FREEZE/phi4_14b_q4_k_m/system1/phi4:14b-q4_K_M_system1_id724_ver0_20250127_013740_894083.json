Disconnection from religious beliefs could correlate with weaker social support structures for some individuals.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors suggests a higher risk profile due to criminal history, demographic factors, and socio-economic indicators. The confidence level reflects the uncertainty inherent in predicting individual behavior based on statistical correlations alone.",
