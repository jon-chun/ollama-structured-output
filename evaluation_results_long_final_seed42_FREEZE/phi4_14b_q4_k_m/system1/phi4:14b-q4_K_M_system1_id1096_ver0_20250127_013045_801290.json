Her belief system does not seem to negatively impact risk assessment.\n\nOverall, while there are some considerations such as living alone and lack of current enrollment in education or training, the balance of factors leans toward low risk. The confidence level reflects a strong reliance on these positive indicators despite the presence of some neutral factors.",
