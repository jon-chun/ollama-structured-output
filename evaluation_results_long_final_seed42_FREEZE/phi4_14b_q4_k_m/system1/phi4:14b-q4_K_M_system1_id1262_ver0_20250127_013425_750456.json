Holding multiple jobs may indicate motivation to maintain employment despite challenges.\n\n4. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use in four years and no recent depression are positive indicators for low risk of future problematic behavior.\n\n5. **Education and Beliefs**: Having a high school diploma without further education might limit opportunities, but it is not an immediate risk factor. His belief that God has nothing to do with what happens personally suggests a lack of religious influence but does not inherently indicate risk.\n\n6. **Overall Context**: The combination of these factors leans towards stability rather than high risk. While some individual factors could contribute to risk in certain contexts, they do not collectively suggest an elevated risk profile in this case.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the generally positive indicators outweighing potential risks associated with youth and single arrests. However, there remains a degree of uncertainty inherent in predicting human behavior based on limited data points.",
