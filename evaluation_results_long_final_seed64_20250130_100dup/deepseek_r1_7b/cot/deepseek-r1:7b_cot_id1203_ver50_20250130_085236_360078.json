    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a strong indicator of past behavior issues, which usually increases the risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 6'1\" and he weighs 165 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height typically affect recidivism rates much on their own, so maybe this doesn't contribute significantly.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be a risk factor if he has unstable environments, but since he's an adult with no ties, it might not add much here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism because without education, one might have fewer opportunities for positive employment or personal growth.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. One job might seem stable, but if he's underemployed or facing challenges at work (like his recent drug use), it could still impact his ability to manage substance abuse or other issues.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe felt so down recently that nothing could cheer him up. Emotional distress might lead to substance misuse or risky behaviors, which could affect his ability to reintegrate into society without issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age in an urban area. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to various social and economic factors, but since he's now 21, it might not have a significant lasting impact unless there were underlying issues like neglect or abuse.\n\nHis belief in God suggests religious support for his decisions, which might reduce some negative influences, but if he's struggling with personal issues, faith alone isn't enough to prevent recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: His history of arrests and convictions is the biggest red flag. The other factors don't add as much weight because while some are present, none stand out as overwhelmingly high risk unless combined with the criminal history. However, considering the recency of his drug use and emotional state, he's at a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"His four arrests and two convictions indicate a history of problematic behavior which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk, especially if he is an adult without close support networks.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may present challenges in obtaining stable employment and personal growth but does not necessarily increase recidivism risk as much as other factors.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Employing one job during the year suggests some stability, though potential underemployment or work-related stress could influence his ability to manage substance use.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (particularly marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood suggest increased risk of relapse which can contribute significantly to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"emotional distress\", \"medium\", \"Recent emotional downing may lead to substance misuse or risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities again.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
