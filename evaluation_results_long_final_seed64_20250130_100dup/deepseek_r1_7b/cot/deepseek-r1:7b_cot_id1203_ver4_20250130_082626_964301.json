    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems significant because more past crimes usually mean higher recidivism risk. So that's probably high risk right there.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. Hmm, weight isn't typically a direct indicator of recidivism unless it's related to substance use or health issues. Since he has a history of drug use, maybe his weight isn't directly relevant here. I'll note that as medium risk because of potential underlying health factors.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. Single status can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but without more info on what those are, it's hard to say how much impact this has. Maybe low or medium risk based on that.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor; lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism because people might turn to criminal activities as a way to compensate or meet basic needs. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe has only held one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors, so this is another high risk indicator.\n\nDrug use history is present; he used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use itself is a major red flag because it's linked to various negative outcomes like crime, poor relationships, etc. So that's high risk.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother at age 5 in an urban area. Early-life stress or neglect can have long-term effects on behavior. Urban environments might offer more opportunities for negative influences, so this could be medium-high risk because of the environment and potential exposure to crime or unstable situations.\n\nHis belief in God is something that doesn't directly relate to recidivism but may influence his behavior indirectly through religious coping mechanisms. Probably low impact here.\n\nPutting it all together: four arrests (high), lack of education (high), single living situation (medium), unemployment (high), drug use (high). The high factors seem to dominate, so the prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"While his weight isn't directly indicative, he has a history of drug use which may correlate with underlying health issues that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently suggest high risk without additional behavioral factors, but it's neutral compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not enrolled in college correlates with higher recidivism rates as individuals may seek alternative means to address life needs.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Only one job held during the year suggests possible underemployment or unemployment, which can lead to substance abuse and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor linked to various negative outcomes including criminal activity and poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may expose him to environmental factors that could influence behavior, though not directly tied to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with recidivism risk but might influence coping mechanisms which are not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
