    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and two convictions. Age-wise, he's still quite young, which might mean he hasn't developed life skills or has less experience that could contribute to lower recidivism. Having multiple arrests suggests he's been in trouble before, which often correlates with higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I'm not sure how height affects risk assessments, but weight might relate to other factors like substance use or health issues, though there's no mention here so maybe it's less relevant.\n\nLiving alone is a point that could be concerning. Living in a stable environment can provide support and reduce stress, which might lower recidivism rates. But since he's living alone, maybe he's facing his own challenges or has less access to help if things go south.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete formal education, which is often linked to higher recidivism because education can provide skills and opportunities that prevent reoffending. Not being enrolled in college might mean he's not actively seeking better opportunities either.\n\nHe only held one job during the year, so employment history isn't great. Unemployment or underemployment is a red flag because having a stable job can help avoid financial stressors that lead to criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana in the past four years and felt low for part of the month. Substance abuse can significantly increase recidivism risk. It might make him more impulsive or susceptible to triggers, increasing chances of relapsing.\n\nHe feels down a lot recently, which could be tied to substance abuse but might also indicate other stressors. If he's feeling this way, maybe he needs support that isn't available to him, pushing him towards criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area suggests he was raised in a multi-parent environment. Sometimes larger families can provide more stability and support, but it could also mean he's experienced various dynamics or family issues that might affect his behavior.\n\nHe believes God plays a role in his life, which is common among many. Religious beliefs don't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are underlying issues like belief in a higher power masking personal struggles.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, substance abuse, recent low mood, and living situation. The factors that increase risk seem significant. Even though he's young, the number of prior offenses, educational gaps, job instability, and substance use are strong indicators pointing towards a high recidivism risk.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards a high relative weight for each factor: prior arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment, substance abuse, recent emotional state. These together make the prediction likely to be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions (4 and 2 respectively) indicate a history of criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests limited educational opportunities, which are often linked to higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate instability and lack of alternative income sources, increasing stress and potential for criminal behavior.\"), \n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) and feelings of low mood could contribute to substance abuse issues that may lead to further criminal activity or self-harm.\"),\n    (\"recent_mood_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for part of the month might indicate stress or depression, which can be a coping mechanism leading to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
