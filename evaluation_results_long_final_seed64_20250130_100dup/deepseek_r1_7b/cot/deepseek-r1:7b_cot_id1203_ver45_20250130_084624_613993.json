He's been convicted four times, which is already a red flag because recidivism rates are higher with multiple convictions.\n\nHe weighs 165 lbs and is 6'1\", but I'm not sure how that plays into it. Maybe he's in a situation where his weight affects his job or stability? Not sure yet.\n\n living alone adds some instability, especially since he's never been married. No support network could mean higher chances of falling into bad habits again.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't going to college, which might limit his opportunities for betterment. Plus, only holding one job during the year is pretty limited in terms of steady income or skills development.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years, especially in the last month when he felt really down, shows he's struggling mentally. That could lead him to substance abuse again, which isn't good for him and others.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother suggests a lot of stress or neglect, which can have long-term effects on his behavior. His belief in God might help in some ways, but it's also possible that he's dealing with personal issues without seeking professional help.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014multiple arrests, education gaps, living alone, substance use, and family background\u2014it seems like a high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested four times significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as recidivism rates are higher with multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college limits opportunities for positive development, which can contribute to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age may have exposed him to stress or neglect, factors that could influence his current behavior and future decisions.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana and feeling down during the past month may indicate potential substance abuse issues, which can be a contributing factor to recidivism but not as directly impactful as other factors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_state\", \"low\"|\"high\", \"Feeling down for much of the time could suggest underlying mental health issues that might need professional intervention.
