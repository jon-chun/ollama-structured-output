    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times and convicted once before. That's a solid history; multiple convictions are usually a red flag because they can lead to more severe sentences.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs, but I don't think his physical stats directly affect recidivism unless there's something about his weight or health that's concerning, which isn't indicated here. He's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have the same support system as someone with family around him, possibly making him more vulnerable.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, so he's likely underemployed or not seeking opportunities. That could contribute to substance abuse because maybe he doesn't see the point in getting better if he's not achieving anything else in life. Plus, he only held one job during the year, which is another sign of underutilization.\n\nHe's used drugs for four years and had some use in the past month. Drug use can really impact someone's ability to function responsibly. It could lead to legal issues or increased risk of other substance abuse behaviors.\n\nHis background is interesting\u2014he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That might mean he was exposed to a lot of stress, neglect, or other challenges which can have long-term effects on his behavior and mental health. Urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates or different social dynamics that could contribute to issues.\n\nHe believes in God, which is positive but also suggests he has some internalized values. However, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there are personal factors at play here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and a convicted history (high risk), no education or job stability (medium), living alone with a drug use history (high), and a challenging early life (high). The factors point towards high risk. I'm not entirely sure about the confidence because while each factor is significant, his age might temper things\u2014though he's still young, so maybe the recidivism rate isn't too different from older individuals. So perhaps around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests (4) and one conviction, indicating past problematic behavior which can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone with Unstable Employment\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, while only holding one job for a year suggests potential underutilization leading to unstable living conditions and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Long-term drug use history (4 years) and recent use can significantly impact an individual's ability to function responsibly and re-enter society without issues.\"),\n    (\"Challenging Early Life\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of 5 with limited support in an urban area at a young age may indicate exposure to stressors that could influence future behavior and recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
