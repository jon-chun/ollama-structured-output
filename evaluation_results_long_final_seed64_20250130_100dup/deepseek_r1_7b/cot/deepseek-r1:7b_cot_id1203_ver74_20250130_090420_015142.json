    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. He's got a history of four arrests and convictions, which is pretty significant. That alone might put him in the high risk category because recidivism rates are higher for those with multipleConvictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I'm not sure how that factors into risk assessment beyond physical health issues, but he doesn't seem to have any visible health problems mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is a factor; living in a single room or apartment can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because there's less supervision and maybe more vulnerability to stressors. But since he's 21, it might not add much weight on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he has limited educational opportunities, which could lead to substance abuse issues or lack of skills for stable employment, both of which increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. That's a red flag because unemployment can lead to reliance on substance use as a coping mechanism and higher chances of getting involved in the criminal justice system again.\n\nDrug use history is another big factor here; he used marijuana in the past four years, which could contribute to addiction issues or risky behaviors that might lead to further involvement.\n\nHis young age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of five suggests family instability. Young boys often face challenges like poverty, neglect, and lack of supervision, all of which can increase the risk of criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering his belief in God could either provide a sense of control or perhaps lead to substance abuse if that belief is causing distress. It's possible he's struggling with issues related to his faith, which might manifest as addiction or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), unemployment and lack of education (high), living alone (medium), young age in a large household (high), and drug use history (high). The factors point towards high risk. I'm going to predict \"YES\" with 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase vulnerability to stressors and substance abuse issues, though it may not be as impactful as other factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"Limited Educational Background\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities for stable employment and lead to substance abuse issues, both of which contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Single Job Experience\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate instability but could also suggest reliance on limited income sources, though it is not a strong indicator in this case.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent drug use can contribute to addiction or risky behaviors that may lead to further criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Family History of Instability\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five at a young age suggests potential family dysfunction, which can influence future behavioral patterns and risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs and Possible Substance Abuse\", \"medium\", \"Considering that God has something to do with his personal struggles may not directly contribute unless it is linked to substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
