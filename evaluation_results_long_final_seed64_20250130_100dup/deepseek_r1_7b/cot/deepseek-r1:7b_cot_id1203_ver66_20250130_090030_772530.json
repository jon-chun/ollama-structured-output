    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's Black, which might have some implications based on any racial biases in the justice system, but without specific data, it's hard to quantify its impact here.\n\nHe has a criminal history of four arrests and two convictions. That's significant; multiple prior convictions are strongly predictive of recidivism. So that factor is probably high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant unless there's some health indicator I'm missing, but since the question doesn't mention anything else about him, I'll leave them as low.\n\nNot being married or living alone\u2014while living alone can be a risk factor for substance abuse, it's not directly tied to recidivism without more context. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nLacking a high school diploma and not attending college is a big red flag. Low educational attainment is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates because of limited opportunities and higher chance of involvement in the criminal system. So this factor should be high.\n\nHe only held one job last year, which could indicate unstable employment. Unemployment or underemployment often correlates with substance abuse and other risk behaviors that lead to reoffending. So medium-high risk here.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana use is noted, and recent feelings of low mood suggest possible substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a known contributor to recidivism, so this factor should be high.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a large household could indicate family stress or neglect, which might contribute to behavioral issues later on. That's probably medium-high risk.\n\nHis belief in God might relate to personal accountability, but without data linking spirituality to recidivism rates, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this as low unless there's more context suggesting otherwise.\n\nPutting all these together, the high factors are the four prior arrests and lack of education. The medium ones include living alone, one job, and recent drug use. The low factors don't add much except maybe his belief in God.\n\nSo overall, considering multiple high risk factors, I'd lean towards a high confidence that he'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, which is strongly predictive of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No Educational Attainment\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and increased risk of involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Employment\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and holding only one job last year may indicate instability, which can contribute to substance abuse and other behaviors that lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest possible substance abuse issues that can increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Family Stress\", \"medium\", \"Exposure at a young age with living in a large household may indicate family stress or neglect, which could contribute to behavioral issues later in life.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
