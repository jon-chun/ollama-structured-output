    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male having rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant number; recidivism is often higher for those with multiple prior offenses. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight are major factors unless they relate to underlying health issues, which we don't have information on here.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no support system there. That could be bad for his stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is usually a protective factor, but if he's not educated and isn't pursuing further education, that's a red flag. Maybe lower confidence to find employment or support.\n\nHe has only held one job during the year. Job instability can lead to poverty, which increases recidivism risk because of possible substance abuse issues.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years, and recently felt down for months without any positive trigger. That could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nYoung age at arrest (21) might mean he's still developing socially and emotionally, so harder to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area adds stressors like family dysfunction or exposure to the environment. Maybe higher risk due to lack of supervision.\n\nReligious beliefs: He thinks God plays a role in his life, which might help some, but if it's causing problems, that could be a negative factor as well.\n\nPutting all these together, he has multiple factors pointing towards high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and higher likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"The presence of drug use history, particularly marijuana, along with feelings of low mood for extended periods, suggests potential substance abuse issues that can contribute to criminal behavior and instability.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with only one job in the past year, may indicate limited opportunities for stability and support, increasing risk factors despite not being a definitive cause.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation and depression, which are associated with higher rates of criminal behavior and substance abuse, further impacting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of five with his biological mother may present family dysfunction issues or environment-related stressors that could contribute to recidivism but may not be as directly impactful as other factors like prior arrests or drug use.\"),\n    (\"Reigious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"While religious beliefs can provide personal support and structure, if they are causing significant distress or conflict, this factor alone may not significantly influence the risk without additional context about potential issues related to his faith.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
