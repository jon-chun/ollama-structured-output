    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. He's living alone, doesn't have a high school diploma, works one job, used marijuana in the past four years, feels down sometimes, lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, and believes God influences his life.\n\nFirst, let me break down each factor:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests and Convictions**: He's been arrested four times, which is significant because multiple convictions can indicate past criminal behavior that might lead to more offenses or reoffending.\n\n2. **Demographics**: Black individuals often have a higher recidivism rate due to systemic factors like racism in the justice system, so this is a high risk factor.\n\n3. **Drug Use**: He's used marijuana and felt down recently. Drug use can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and potentially lead to more risky situations or substance abuse issues contributing to future crimes.\n\n4. **Employment**: He only works one job at the moment. While having employment is positive, not being able to support himself might leave him vulnerable to exploitation or unstable environments.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone can be isolating and might not provide enough supervision or support, which could lead to emotional distress or substance abuse issues as mentioned.\n\n6. **Past Living Arrangement**: Lived with his mother in a household of five suggests he's dependent on family for stability but living in an urban area might offer more opportunities and less oversight, potentially leading to instability.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: His religious belief could provide some support against substance abuse or negative emotions but also might not address the root causes like lack of support systems.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor points towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which can indicate past criminal behavior that may increase the likelihood of future offenses or reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Demographics - Black Background\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues in the justice system which can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, leading to potential future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status - One Job\", \"medium\", \"Single job employment is positive but not ideal; instability in financial situation may leave the individual vulnerable to exploitation or adverse environments.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to emotional distress and external stressors, potentially leading to substance abuse issues which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Past Living Arrangement - Household of Five in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"While living with family provides some support, the urban setting may offer more opportunities for instability without adequate supervision.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Religious belief may provide some emotional support but does not address underlying issues like lack of a strong support network or accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
