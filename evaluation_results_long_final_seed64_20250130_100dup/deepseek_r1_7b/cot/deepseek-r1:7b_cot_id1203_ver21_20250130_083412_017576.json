Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his high number of prior convictions\u20144 times\u2014should significantly increase the risk. Each prior conviction is a marker for past issues, making him more likely to reoffend.\n\nHe's got a history of substance use, specifically marijuana in the past four years and recent drug use. Substance abuse often correlates with unstable behavior or impulsive decisions that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHis current living situation alone\u2014living alone without a support network\u2014is another red flag. Lack of support can mean he's more isolated and might not get help when needed, increasing the chance of further issues.\n\nHe has an interrupted education\u2014he didn't finish high school or get a GED. Education is a key factor in successful reintegration; without it, he may struggle to find meaningful work or connect socially, leading him back into trouble.\n\nThe job history\u2014only held one job during the year\u2014suggests inconsistency and perhaps difficulty finding stable employment. Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increased risk of involvement with law enforcement again.\n\nHis young age and living with his biological mother in a large household might indicate family issues or environment that could contribute to behavioral problems. At such an early stage, he might not have developed the necessary life skills.\n\nHis belief in God suggests a potential moral compass, but it's hard to gauge how influential this is without more context. However, it doesn't directly point towards criminal behavior, so maybe his religion isn't as significant here.\n\nPutting all these together\u2014high prior convictions, drug use, living alone, interrupted education, and unstable job situation\u2014it seems very high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple factors indicating a high risk of recidivism. His history of prior arrests, substance use, living situation, education interruptions, and job instability all contribute significantly to his likelihood of reoffending.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"His four prior arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior that increases the likelihood of future involvement in the legal system.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and past drug issues suggest potential for unstable behavior or impulsive actions leading to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing isolation and the risk of engaging in risky behaviors without immediate consequences.\"),\n    (\"Education Interrupted\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can hinder his ability to find stable employment and effectively reintegrate into society, increasing recidivism chances.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job may indicate limited career stability, but without further information on recent job changes or performance, this factor's weight is lower compared to others.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
