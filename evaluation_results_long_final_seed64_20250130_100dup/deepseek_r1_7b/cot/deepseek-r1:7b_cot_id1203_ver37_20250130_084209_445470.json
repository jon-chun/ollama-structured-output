    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this individual using his risk factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a Black male with four prior arrests and convictions. Recidivistic tendencies are definitely higher here because of the multiple convictions. So that's a high risk right there.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs, but I don't think physical characteristics play a big role in recidivism unless there's something specific like being tall affecting his job opportunities or living situation. Since he's currently living alone, maybe it doesn't influence much here except for the fact that living alone isn't inherently a bad sign.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can lead to poor decision-making and higher chances of getting into trouble again. So this is also a medium-high risk factor because educational attainment is a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which might mean he's either unemployed or underemployed. Joblessness can result in increased stress and substance use, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates. So this should contribute to medium-high risk.\n\nDrug use history is another big factor here. He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use often correlates with poor life choices, strained relationships, and other behavioral issues that can lead to further arrests. This definitely pushes him into a high-risk category.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area could have both positive and negative implications. Urban environments might offer more opportunities but also expose him to risk factors like higher crime rates or unstable family environments. The mention of God influencing his life suggests he might be religious, which can sometimes result in self-punishment for sinning, potentially leading to more substance use issues.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), no education (medium-high), joblessness (medium), drug use (high). All these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. The presence of God as a factor might add some stress but doesn't change the overall trend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lack of educational attainment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can increase the risk of reoffending due to limited opportunities and resources.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"medium\", \"Employment status is unstable, which may contribute to stress and substance use issues that can lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"high\", \"Drug abuse in the past four years is a significant risk factor for reoffending due to potential strained relationships and behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother in an urban area at young age\", \"medium-high\", \"Exposure to urban environments can have both positive and negative effects, but combined with other factors like drug use, it contributes to higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
