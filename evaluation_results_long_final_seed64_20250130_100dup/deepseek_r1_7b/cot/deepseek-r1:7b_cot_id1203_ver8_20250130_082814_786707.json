    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict his rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and four convictions. That's a significant number; multiple convictions can indicate past problematic behavior which might increase future chances of reoffending. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I don't know if his weight or height is directly relevant, but maybe his BMI could be an indicator, though he's young so it might not matter much. Maybe no direct impact here, so this might be a low factor.\n\nLiving alone\u2014since he's never married and living solo can reduce social support, which might make him more vulnerable to stress or triggers that could lead to recidivism. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Low educational attainment often correlates with higher recidivism rates because there are fewer opportunities for positive outcomes or learning skills necessary for success. High risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which is another indicator of low stability and economic dependence. Unstable employment can lead to chronic stress and other issues that might push him back into criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana in past four years and recent drug use in the last month. Drug use can impair judgment, reduce cognitive function, and increase impulsivity, all of which are bad predictors for recidivism. High risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large, possibly dysfunctional family could lead to dependency issues or emotional abuse, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior later on. Medium-high risk here since it's significant but maybe not as high as other factors.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014his religious beliefs might influence his decision-making and behavior, but without more info, it's hard to assess how much that affects recidivism. Maybe a low factor unless religious issues contribute to past problems.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, no education, unemployment, living alone, drug use, family environment\u2014all these factors point towards high risk of rearrest. So I'd predict \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and four convictions, which indicates past problematic behavior that may increase future recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, potentially making the individual more vulnerable to stress or triggers leading to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Low Educational Attainment\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college are significant factors correlated with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for positive outcomes and necessary skills.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Employment\", \"high\", \"Held only one job during the year, which may indicate low economic stability and increased stress that could contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in past four years and recent drug use in the last month can impair judgment, reduce cognitive function, and increase impulsivity, all of which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Large Family Environment\", \"medium-high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area may indicate potential dysfunctionality or abuse that could influence criminal behavior later in life.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
