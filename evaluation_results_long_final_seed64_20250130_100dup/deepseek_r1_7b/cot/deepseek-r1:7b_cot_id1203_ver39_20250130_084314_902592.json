    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 21 years old. He has four prior arrests and convictions. Recidivism is higher among those with multiple arrests, so that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think his weight or height directly contribute to recidivism unless there's something about it, but nothing here suggests he's in poor health. So maybe this is low.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living situation can affect stability, so that might be a medium risk factor because being single and alone could lead to higher stress and substance use issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a big predictor of recidivism. Not having a degree increases the chances, especially if he's engaging in risky behavior like drug use. So that would be high risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on drugs and other activities, so this might contribute to high risk.\n\nDrug use history: used marijuana before but hasn't been in the past month except for feeling down. Past use is a concern because even if it's less now, substance abuse can be a relapse point. That's probably medium.\n\nHe felt extremely down recently; maybe that indicates some mental health issues or stressors, which could lead to more substance use or other risky behaviors. Medium risk factor here.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. High risk due to living with multiple family members who might not provide supervision, and urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors. That's high risk.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life. While spirituality can reduce recidivism if it provides direction or support, it could also lead to neglecting other areas like substance use if not integrated properly. So maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests (high), education issues (high), living alone and single (medium), joblessness (high), drug use history (medium), recent emotional distress (medium), and family environment (high). The prediction is YES, high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a significant arrest history which directly correlates with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not enrolled in college increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation, leading to increased stress and potential substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Being unemployed or holding only one job for a short period may lead to dependency on substances or other risky activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use history, even if recent, can indicate vulnerability to relapse and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Indicators\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of extreme down mood could signal underlying mental health issues that may affect substance use or behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with multiple family members in an urban area without adequate supervision can increase exposure to stressors and crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
