    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times. He's got a lot of negative points going on here.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with fourConvictions, which is really significant. Repeating that as many times as possible shows a pattern of trouble, so high weight there.\n\nHis age might be a factor too; being 21 means he's just starting out, but his past convictions make up for it more than his age would otherwise suggest. Still, maybe medium to low weight here because of the recency of his issues.\n\nHe lives alone without a spouse or children, which could mean less support and support systems that help people recover. Medium weight since living alone might contribute but not as strongly as other factors like substance use.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is another big red flag. Educational barriers can lead to more substance abuse and job instability, so high weight on lack of education.\n\nHe's only held one job in the past year, which isn't great for someone with a history of issues. Maybe medium because even though he tried working, having a job could help if he was able to secure it, but he didn't, so maybe less weight than someone with more stable employment.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014marijuana in the past four years and sometimes recently. Drug abuse can impair judgment, increase recidivism risk, and makes rehabilitation harder, so high weight here.\n\nHe feels down often and couldn't find solace despite trying. This could indicate deeper mental health issues or a lack of positive coping mechanisms, which would add to his risk factors\u2014maybe medium because it's not as direct as substance use but still significant.\n\nLiving in a household of five with his biological mother might suggest family dysfunction, which can affect behavior and support structure. Medium weight since it's related but not the most immediate factor compared to things like drug use or education level.\n\nLastly, he believes in God's influence on his life. While spirituality can aid recovery, it doesn't directly contribute to risk unless he's struggling with issues that religion can't address, which isn't specified here\u2014so maybe low weight because it's more of an attribute than a liability.\n\nPutting all these together: fourConvictions is high, lack of education is high, past drug use and emotional distress are medium. The rest don't add up enough to tip the scale again. So his overall risk for rearrest within three years is pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"fourConvictions\", \"high\", \"Repetitive criminal history indicates a pattern of trouble, increasing the likelihood of future offenses and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lackOfEducation\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED suggests barriers to education which may contribute to substance abuse and instability.\"),\n    (\"pastDrugUse\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years and recent use can impair judgment and increase the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"emotionalDistress\", \"medium\", \"Frequent feelings of low mood without solace indicates potential mental health issues that may affect recovery.\"),\n    (\"age21\", \"low\", \"Age may not be a strong indicator given the history of convictions, but it is a consideration for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"singleLiving\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to stressors and lack of support networks which can aid recovery.\"),\n    (\"pastEmployment\", \"low\", \"Only one job in the past year may not be sufficient to establish a stable lifestyle or rebuild trust after convictions.\"),\n    (\"familyHome\", \"medium\", \"Household size five with biological mother may indicate family dysfunction affecting behavior and support structure.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly contribute to risk unless struggling issues are unresolved, which is not specified.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
