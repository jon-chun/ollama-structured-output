    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me break down all the factors he has.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested four times and has a conviction history. That seems like a solid indicator of past issues\u2014higher chances of reoffending. So that's probably high.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here, but maybe they could relate to other factors, though I don't see how in this case.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have the same support structure as someone who lives with family or a partner. That could be a medium risk factor because while he's independent, it can sometimes lead to stressors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014definitely raises the bar. Educational barriers often lead to unstable situations that might contribute to recidivism. So another high factor here.\n\nHe only held one job during the year\u2014that\u2019s a tough spot. Unemployment for so long can create dependency issues, making it harder to find steady employment again, which is a high risk.\n\nDrug use history, especially marijuana, and recent feelings of low mood\u2014mood swings could indicate underlying mental health issues that might contribute to criminal behavior. That's another medium factor because while it's concerning, it's not as directly tied to recidivism as other factors like prior convictions or education.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014family dynamics can be complex and sometimes chaotic, which might lead to behavioral issues. So that could be high risk.\n\nBelieving in God plays into his mindset but doesn't directly influence behavior towards crime. It's more of a personal belief than a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the top red flags\u2014four times is significant. His lack of education and job stability add to the risk. Living alone could be a moderate concern, but not as high as prior issues. The drug use might indicate underlying issues but isn't as direct. His family background in a large household adds some risk.\n\nSo his overall prediction would lean towards high risk because of the prior convictions and education issues. The prediction is \"YES\" with 75% confidence because these factors are strong indicators, though other variables like support systems or personal circumstances could mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having four prior arrests and a conviction history significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, combined with not being enrolled in college, indicates potential academic instability which may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for a year may indicate limited opportunities and financial dependency issues that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use history (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying mental health concerns that can influence criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area may have contributed to behavioral or emotional issues that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"independent_living\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without support from family or a partner can increase stress and instability, which are risk factors for reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
