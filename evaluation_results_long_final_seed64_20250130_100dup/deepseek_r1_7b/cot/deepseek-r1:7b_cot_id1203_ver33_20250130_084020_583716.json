    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query where the user is asking for a risk assessment on a 21-year-old Black male with several factors. They want me to assign weights to each risk factor and then predict rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors given. He has a criminal history\u20144 arrests and convictions. That's a strong indicator of past issues, so I'll consider that as high risk because recidivism is more likely with multiple offenses.\n\nHis education level is low\u2014he didn't finish high school or get a GED and isn't in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher crime rates and difficulty finding stable employment, which can contribute to reoffending.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to reintegrate after incarceration. Instability from being single could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has only one job, so his income stability is questionable. Unemployment or underemployment can strain family responsibilities and mental health, adding another medium factor.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana in the past four years\u2014and recent feelings of low mood affecting his mood during the last month. Substance abuse can impair judgment and contribute to other criminal behaviors, making this a high risk factor.\n\nChildhood living conditions are tough\u2014he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Poor living conditions often lead to behavioral issues and higher recidivism rates due to early trauma.\n\nReligious belief has some influence on him but doesn't directly tie into criminal behavior, so this might be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest convictions (high), low education (high), single living situation (medium), job instability (medium), drug use (high). The prediction leans towards high risk with a confidence of 75%. That makes sense because the key factors like prior convictions and lack of education, along with other contributing issues, point towards significant recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED reduces future employability and stability, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation and stress, potentially affecting mental health and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year may indicate instability, which could influence behavior or reliability in reincarceration\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"high\", \" drug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana, can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Childhood living conditions\", \"high\", \"Living with five family members in an urban area at a young age may have contributed to behavioral issues or increased vulnerability to substance abuse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
