    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male with four arrests and two convictions. Recidivism is often higher among minorities due to systemic issues, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. This is within the normal range for his age, but weight alone doesn't directly affect recidivism rates unless it relates to other factors like health or substance use.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which could mean he has fewer social support networks that might help him stay out of trouble. Maybe lower socioeconomic status too since he didn't finish high school or get a GED.\n\nHe only held one job in the past year. Job instability can lead to increased stress and substance use issues, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nUsing marijuana for four years suggests occasional drug use. While not severe, it's still a risk factor as substance abuse can strain relationships and mental health, possibly leading to more impulsive behavior or legal issues.\n\nHe felt so down in the past month that nothing could cheer him up. This might indicate depression or anxiety, both mental health issues linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Siblinghood in large households can sometimes lead to more stress and less supervision, increasing the risk of criminal behavior later on.\n\nLastly, he believes in God but doesn't see it as directly influencing his personal events. While belief in religion can be protective, if there's no clear connection here, it might not significantly affect risk assessment.\n\nPutting all these factors together, they all contribute to a high relative weight each. The combination makes the overall prediction high for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has four arrests and two convictions, which are significant indicators of past criminal behavior and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Demographics\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no spouse or children may imply lower support networks, though it doesn't directly correlate with higher risk without other factors like substance use or lack of education\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job in the past year suggests some level of stability but could also indicate limited opportunities for growth and alternative income sources which might reduce future criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana on a regular basis, especially with feelings of low mood or depression, can contribute to impulsive behavior and increased risk of substance abuse-related offenses\"),\n    (\"Living situation at a young age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five, particularly in an urban area, may have provided insufficient supervision or support, potentially leading to criminal behavior later in life\"),\n    (\"Mental health indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and not being able to find comfort suggests possible underlying mental health issues which can increase vulnerability to substance abuse and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED despite being 21 years old may indicate limited opportunities for personal development and alternative pathways to avoid criminal involvement\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
