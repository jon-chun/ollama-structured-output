He's been arrested four times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of past issues. His age being 21 might mean he's still developing his life skills, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nHe weighs 165 lbs at 6'1\", so that doesn't immediately tell me much about his risk factors. He's living alone, which can be isolating and maybe contribute to substance use or other issues. No high school diploma or GED means he might have struggled academically, possibly leading him down a path of crime.\n\nHe's only held one job in the past year. Unemployment for that long could mean systemic issues affecting his ability to get a stable job. Using marijuana in the past four years and feeling low recently points towards substance abuse problems. That can really increase recidivism rates because it impairs judgment and can lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at such a young age in an urban area might have shaped his personality or behaviors, possibly leading him into trouble. His belief in God could be a positive motivator but also might mean he's struggling with deeper issues that aren't addressed.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions, substance use, unemployment, living situation, and limited education all contribute to higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"priorconvictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating past criminal behavior which can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age at 21 may suggest emerging life skills but also potential issues like substance abuse or employability affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"livesingle\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases isolation risks and could contribute to substance use or other behavioral issues, increasing rearrest likelihood.\"),\n    (\"educationlevel\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED reflects educational barriers which may impede positive life choices and stability.\"),\n    (\"jobhistory\", \"low\", \"Employment history of one job in the past year may indicate temporary instability rather than a consistent risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substanceuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues that can lead to impulsive behaviors and increased rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"householdstatus\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area at a young age may have influenced behavioral patterns or life choices contributing to current issues.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God could provide some motivation but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk and might suggest potential areas for personal growth that are unaddressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
