    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times and convicted. That's a lot of convictions already, which might indicate some underlying issues or instability.\n\nHis physical characteristics are average height and weight, nothing too concerning there. Living alone is a point; sometimes living alone can lead to isolation, but it's not always directly linked to crime unless there's a history of antisocial behavior.\n\nEducation-wise, he didn't finish high school or get a GED. That's a red flag because education levels often correlate with lower recidivism rates when higher than dropouts. Not being enrolled in college suggests maybe he hasn't sought help, which could be problematic.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long can affect motivation and self-sufficiency. Plus, not having a stable environment might increase risk factors like substance abuse or lack of support networks.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years, and recently felt down. Depression or anxiety could be contributing factors. If he's struggling with mental health, that can make him more susceptible to making impulsive decisions leading to further crimes.\n\nChildhood trauma is significant here. Living with his biological mother in a household of five kids might have caused a lot of stress and emotional issues. That kind of environment often leads to behavioral problems later on, which can increase the risk of rearrest.\n\nHe believes in God but isn't clear about how that affects him personally. While religion can be protective sometimes, it's not always a guarantee and could also present challenges if he's dealing with personal struggles.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, education issues, unemployment, drug use, trauma, living alone... These factors point towards a high risk of recidivism in the next three years. The presence of prior convictions and a history of substance abuse, combined with potential mental health issues from trauma, makes him more likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior convictions (4) can indicate underlying issues such as antisocial behavior or lack of motivation, which increase the likelihood of future crimes.\"),\n    (\"unstable_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and having only one job may contribute to instability and a lack of support system that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of education (no diploma) can result in limited opportunities and higher risk of engaging in illegal activities such as drug use or theft.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, and feelings of depression/anxiety may impair judgment and increase the likelihood of impulsive behaviors leading to criminal acts\"),\n    (\"childhood_trauma\", \"high\", \"Exposure to trauma at a young age can lead to behavioral issues, substance abuse, and a higher risk of recidivism throughout one's life.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
