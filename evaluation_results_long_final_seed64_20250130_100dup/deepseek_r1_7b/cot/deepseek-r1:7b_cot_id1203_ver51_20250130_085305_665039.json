    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivism is higher among people with multiple offenses, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe they could relate to some form of abuse, but given the info, I'm focusing on more behavioral factors.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which might mean he's not getting support from family or friends. Not being married could lead to increased stress or lack of emotional support, which are concerning signs for recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma and no college enrollment suggest he may face educational challenges, leading him towards substance abuse or other risky behaviors. That's another medium-high risk factor.\n\nHe only held one job during the year, so maybe he's unemployed or underemployed. Unemployment can lead to dependency on drugs as a way of coping, which could increase his chances of engaging in harmful activities again.\n\nDrug use history, especially marijuana, and recent feelings of low mood might indicate substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can impede job performance, legal behavior, etc.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could imply living in poverty or neglectful conditions. Poor environments often correlate with higher recidivism rates due to exposure to adverse factors like substance abuse and lack of education.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his motivation towards positive outcomes, but it's not directly tied to recidivism risk. Still, if he's struggling emotionally, that could affect his decision-making.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (high), no support system (medium-high), educational issues (medium), job instability (medium), drug use (high), living in poverty/neglect (high). The prediction would lean towards high risk with a confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor, the individual exhibits multiple signs of potential recidivism. The factors contributing to his risk include a significant criminal history, lack of support system, educational challenges, job instability, drug use, and living in an adverse environment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4) and convictions (2) significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living alone without spouse\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lead to emotional stress and lack of support, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse and job dependency, both linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"only one job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Joblessness or part-time work can lead to substance abuse use as a coping mechanism, increasing the likelihood of engaging in harmful activities.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana) and mood\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, along with feelings of low mood, suggests potential substance abuse issues that can impede judgment and legal behavior.\"),\n    (\"household size 5 in urban area\", \"high\", \"Living in a large household within an urban setting may indicate exposure to adverse conditions, which are often associated with higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
