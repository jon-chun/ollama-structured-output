    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for this 21-year-old Black male trying to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted\u2014so multiple prior convictions are definitely a strong indicator of higher risk. That would be high weight.\n\nHe's only 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. I don't know if that affects recidivism much unless there's something about his physical health or substance use, which ties into the next point.\n\n living alone might increase stress or isolation, but since he's Black, maybe systemic issues contribute more to this risk factor\u2014so medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma and not in college. Educational attainment is a big factor; not having that could mean less stable future, so high weight.\n\nOnly one job during the year\u2014he might be underemployed or facing economic instability, which can lead to more stress and higher recidivism risk\u2014high weight.\n\nDrug use history, especially marijuana over four years, plus recent use in the past month. Drug abuse is a major predictor of re-arrest, so high weight.\n\nAt a young age, lived with five people in an urban area. That's a tough start; family environment and living conditions can have long-term effects\u2014high weight.\n\nBelieves in God, which might suggest some level of spirituality or support system that could influence his behavior\u2014if anything, maybe lower risk? But it's subjective, so perhaps medium.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions (high), education issues (high), job instability (high), drug use (high), family background (high). The belief in God is less clear but not a strong indicator. \n\nSo each factor except the last one gets high weight. Since all factors point to higher risk, I'll predict \"YES\" with very high confidence\u2014probably 95%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having four prior arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending due to established criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Age and Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Experiencing tough family conditions at a young age can lead to behavioral issues that may contribute to future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED can result in limited opportunities and potential substance abuse, both of which are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate underemployment or economic instability, which can contribute to stress and substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, especially marijuana, along with recent substance abuse, suggests potential triggers for relapse and increased risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religion and Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may provide some level of support or guidance but does not necessarily mitigate the risk factors associated with prior convictions and other negative behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
