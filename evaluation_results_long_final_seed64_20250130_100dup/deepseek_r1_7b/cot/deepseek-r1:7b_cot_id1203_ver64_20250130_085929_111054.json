    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and two convictions. He's living alone without a high school diploma, has job experience, uses marijuana, and has some recent low moods. His early life was in a household of five, which might indicate family dysfunction. He believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the number of prior convictions\u2014four is significant, pointing towards established criminal history. Then, his lack of education could impair employability and self-stability. Living alone increases vulnerability to stressors like substance use or emotional distress. His recent marijuana use might signal ongoing substance issues affecting behavior.\n\nHis young age and living with five siblings in an urban area suggest possible family dysfunction that could contribute to unstable home environment. Believing in God might help, but past experiences can still influence risk factors if they lead to emotional instability or substance abuse.\n\nConsidering all these, I'll assign each factor a weight based on their impact. Prior convictions are high because of the history. Uneducated status is medium since it affects opportunities. Living alone and family issues are both medium. Drug use is medium/moderate due to its direct impact. Recent low moods moderate. Belief in God is low as it's more about personal belief than risk factors.\n\nAdding these up, the total risk score suggests a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating established criminal behavior which can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate may impact employability and self-stability, increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"single_residence\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without support structures can lead to increased stressors such as substance use or emotional distress, which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug Use in past four years\", \"moderate\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can affect judgment and behavior, increasing the likelihood of future criminal incidents.\"),\n    (\"recent_low_moods\", \"moderate\", \"F frequent low moods may indicate ongoing emotional distress or substance abuse issues that could impact decision-making and risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of five with biological mother adds complexity to family dynamics, which may not directly correlate but can influence underlying stressors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
