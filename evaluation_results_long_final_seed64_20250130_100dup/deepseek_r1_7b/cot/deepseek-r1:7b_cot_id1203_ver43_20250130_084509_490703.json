    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four prior arrests and convictions. That seems pretty significant because having multiple convictions increases the chance of getting into trouble again. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nNext, his physical characteristics: tall at 6'1\" and underweight? Wait, no, 165 lbs isn't that heavy for someone his height. Maybe he's just average weight. Not sure if that plays a role in recidivism beyond weight issues or something else.\n\nHe's living alone, which might not be directly related to crime but could be an indicator of stability. I don't think living situation is as strong a factor here unless there are other factors like substance use nearby.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lacking education can lead to unstable situations where he might not seek help when needed. So that's another medium-high risk factor.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Having some income is better than nothing, but only working one job might mean limited opportunities for growth or support systems. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. Substance abuse can be a big driver of recidivism because it can lead to unstable behavior or increased drug-seeking behaviors. So that's high risk.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he might have experienced neglect or abuse, which can have long-term effects on his behavior and willingness to comply with laws. That's definitely high risk.\n\nReligious involvement: He believes God has something to do with his life. While that doesn't directly correlate with crime, it might influence his personal behavior. However, I'm not sure how strong this is as a predictive factor compared to other factors like substance use or living situation.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, lack of education, job experience, drug use, and family background all point towards high risk. The presence of any of these factors is concerning enough that the overall prediction should be YES with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (4) significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can lead to limited opportunities for positive development and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low self-esteem associated with drug use can contribute to unstable personal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Experiencing neglect or abuse at a young age increases vulnerability to criminal behavior and substance abuse patterns.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but may be an indicator of potential isolation or lack of support network.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
