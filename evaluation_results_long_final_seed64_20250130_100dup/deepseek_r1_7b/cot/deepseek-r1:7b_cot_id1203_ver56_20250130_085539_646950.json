His age being 21 might mean he's still developing his skills, so that could contribute to low confidence in his ability to reform.\n\nHe's only 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs; I wonder if that affects his opportunities or stability. Being single living alone adds stress, maybe making him more prone to substance use as a coping mechanism. \n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he might have limited job options, forcing him into harder labor which can be isolating. Only one job in the past year suggests he's not actively seeking better opportunities.\n\nDrug use history, especially marijuana, is concerning but recent use doesn't necessarily mean ongoing substance abuse unless there are other triggers like stress or trauma.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area could have led to a lot of emotional challenges. Considering his belief in God might provide some coping mechanisms, but it's not a shield against all issues.\n\nHe feels down and uses nothing to cheer himself up during tough times, which points towards deeper mental health issues that might influence his risk of recidivism.\n\nPutting all these factors together, while there are mitigating elements like single living situation and lack of education, the key factors here\u2014the four prior convictions, age-related context, drug use, and family background\u2014strongly indicate a high risk. \n\nI'd lean towards a high relative weight because even though some factors might lower his risk slightly, the overall profile points to significant recidivism tendencies over three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which could predict future involvement in the justice system.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 21, this individual is still developing life skills, which may influence recidivism rates but does not inherently increase risk over time.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stress and isolation, which can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism and may affect job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED reduces future earning potential and job stability, potentially leading to harder labor or unemployment which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Only one job in the past year suggests limited career growth and opportunities for upward mobility, which could impede efforts towards reintegration into society after potential incarceration.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) is concerning.
