    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. He's been arrested four times with a prior conviction, which is already concerning. His age being 21 also makes me think he might still be developing his life skills.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, so educational support could be an issue for him. He only has one job, which might not provide enough stability if that job were to end suddenly.\n\nLiving alone without any support networks can isolate him, making it harder for him to get help when he needs it. His past use of marijuana and feeling down adds stressors; substance abuse often correlates with recidivism.\n\nHis early life was tough in a household of five, which might have left him emotionally vulnerable. Believing in God could offer some support but isn't a strong mitigating factor for criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014prior convictions, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance use\u2014I think he's at a high risk. So I'd predict YES to rearrest and assign it a high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and prior convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED despite being 21 years old indicates potential challenges in acquiring necessary life skills and avoiding further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year may leave him vulnerable if his employment is terminated, increasing the risk of losing income support and motivation to reintegrate positively.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a support network reduces access to resources, legal aid, and community support, which are crucial for avoiding or mitigating criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent drug use during the last month can increase stress and negative emotions, potentially leading to substance abuse issues that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Challenges\", \"low\", \"Living with five family members in an urban area at a young age may have provided some level of emotional stability or support, though it also indicates potential neglect which could impact his current adjustment and future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide personal guidance but are not typically seen as mitigating factors for criminal recidivism, especially if they do not address the root causes of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
