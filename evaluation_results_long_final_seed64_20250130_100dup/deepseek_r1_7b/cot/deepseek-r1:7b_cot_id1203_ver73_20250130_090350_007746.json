    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male reoffending within three years. He's Black, has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. His demographics are average height and weight, living alone, no high school diploma, and he's never married.\n\nHe's only held one job recently, which is quite significant because having recent stable employment can reduce recidivism. He's been using marijuana for the past four years, but especially the last month when he felt really down. That could affect his mental state and self-control.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area might have had a tough impact. Being raised alone adds stress, which can contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral issues. His belief in God suggests a possible lack of strong support system at home, which is another risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested multiple times, so each prior offense increases the chances of reoffending. Without a diploma and not attending college shows limited opportunities for positive change. Living alone without a support network might leave him more vulnerable to external influences.\n\nHis recent job experience as a single individual could indicate he's proactive but also possibly facing challenges that may lead to substance abuse or other issues again. The marijuana use, especially in the past month when he felt low, is concerning because it can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the risk of impulsive behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone without support, recent drug use affecting his mental state, family background, and limited job experience. Each of these points leans towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, which is a strong indicator of past misconduct and potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Education\", \"medium\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, indicating limited opportunities for positive change and learning from past mistakes.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress levels and provide fewer social supports, potentially leading to substance abuse or other behavioral issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Recent Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently, which could impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the risk of impulsive behavior during reoffending attempts.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living with a household of five at a young age in an urban area can lead to challenges such as neglect or abuse, contributing to behavioral issues that may persist into adulthood and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"His belief in God might suggest a lack of strong support system, which could result in emotional distress and substance abuse during challenging times, potentially leading to reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
