    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted once. That seems significant because more convictions are usually linked to higher recidivism rates. So that's a high factor.\n\nHe's only 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect his risk unless it relates to other factors like being in prison, which he isn't here. So maybe low impact.\n\nLiving alone is another point. While living with someone can reduce stress and support, living alone doesn't necessarily make him more likely to reoffend unless there are personal issues at home. But given no info on that, I'll say medium.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Educational barriers often mean he might not have the skills needed for better opportunities, increasing his risk. So high factor.\n\nHeld only one job recently. Job loss can contribute to poverty and other negative factors. High risk here too.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana in past four years and recent drug use during a month when he felt down. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of unstable mental health, which could lead to more impulsive crimes or not seeking help, increasing recidivism. So high factor.\n\nYoung age at 21 living with his mother in a household of five in an urban area. Being raised by the biological mother might have different social dynamics compared tostepfamilies. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but also exposure to crime and unstable situations. However, being in such a large household doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there's neglect or abuse. So maybe medium.\n\nConsidering God as something in his life suggests he has some religious support, which might not directly affect his criminal behavior. But religious factors can sometimes influence decision-making. Maybe low impact here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high and medium factors like prior convictions, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and living situation. The prediction is likely to rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and one conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but could be a contributing factor if there are personal issues or instability in the home environment.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"high\", \"The lack of a high school diploma or GED can hinder opportunities and contribute to unstable personal circumstances that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"high\", \"Employment history shows instability with only one job held recently, which could be a risk factor for engaging in criminal activities such as drug use or theft.\"), \n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly during a period of low mood, suggests potential substance abuse issues that can lead to impulsive behavior and increased crime risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area does not directly correlate with higher risk unless there are signs of neglect or abuse which are not mentioned here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
