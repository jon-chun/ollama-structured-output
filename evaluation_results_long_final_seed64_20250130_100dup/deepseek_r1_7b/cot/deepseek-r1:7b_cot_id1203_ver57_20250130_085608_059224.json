    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided specific details about a 21-year-old male with several risk factors and asked for a JSON response with relative weights assigned to each factor, a prediction, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through the information given. The person is Black, 21, has been arrested four times, convicted, weighs 165 lbs, 6 feet 1 inch\u2014though that might not be as relevant here. He's living alone, no high school diploma or GED, only one job in the past year, uses drugs (marijuana) and feels down sometimes.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age, which could indicate some form of abuse or neglect. His belief in God might suggest he has a strong moral compass but also could relate to potential self-control issues.\n\nNow, considering each factor:\n\n1. Age: 21 is quite young for recidivism, usually lower risk unless there are other factors.\n2. Drug Use: Past four years with marijuana use\u2014moderate risk.\n3. Previous Convictions: Four times\u2014high risk.\n4. Living Alone: No data on living situation and possible lack of support\u2014moderate to high risk.\n5. Education Level: No HS diploma or GED\u2014low to medium risk, but without college attendance, it's a risk factor if he isn't seeking help.\n6. Employment: Held one job in the past year\u2014since he has a history, maybe he's looking to change which could lower risk slightly.\n7. Family History: Living with biological mother in a household of five\u2014a red flag for abuse/neglect\u2014high risk.\n\nPutting this together, each factor contributes differently. The strongest factors are previous convictions and family living situation. Drug use and education level also add to the risk. Age is on the lower end but not mitigating enough.\n\nSo, I think the overall prediction would be high risk with a confidence of around 70%\u2014moderate but significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to older individuals, but other factors may still influence outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Previous Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent use may signal potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job for a year does not necessarily indicate high risk, but lack of steady employment history can sometimes be a contributing factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED may suggest limited opportunities and potential challenges in reintegrating into society.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age raises concerns about possible abuse, neglect, or other family issues that could impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and sometimes unable to cope may indicate potential mental health issues that could contribute to risk behavior or substance use issues\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
