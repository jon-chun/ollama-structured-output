    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with two convictions already. That's a solid point towards higher risk because each prior offense increases the chances of reoffending.\n\nHis age is still young at 21, but he has no high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This means he likely has less educational support, which can affect his employability and ability to find alternative opportunities after incarceration.\n\nHe's currently living alone without a partner, so he doesn't have someone to share responsibilities with, like child custody or household management. That could leave him more vulnerable if he ends up in a situation where he needs help but doesn't have a support system.\n\nOnly holding one job during the year might mean he has limited income sources. If his job is unstable or doesn't offer good benefits, he might struggle to sustain himself financially after release, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nHe admitted to drug use in the past four years, especially marijuana recently. Drug use can impair judgment and lead to impulsive decisions that could put him at risk. The recent feelings of low mood might make him more susceptible to substance abuse or making poor choices.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area adds stressors. Being raised by multiple family members, especially in an urban setting, can sometimes create dependency issues and may influence his behavior patterns or decision-making towards riskier activities.\n\nHis religious belief that God has some role is interesting. While it's not directly tied to criminal behavior, it might affect his motivation for change after incarceration but also could be a barrier if he feels disconnected from societal support systems unless he actively seeks help.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior convictions (high), limited education and employment (medium each?), living alone (low maybe? Wait, no\u2014he's alone without a partner, so maybe high risk because isolation can lead to higher recidivism). Drug use (high), recent emotional low (maybe medium or high in terms of impact on future behavior).\n\nEach prior conviction is a high factor. No education and job issues are medium each. Living alone might be a bit lower but still relevant as isolation could increase stress, so maybe medium. Drug use is definitely high because it's a direct risk factor.\n\nConsidering all these, the overall risk seems quite high. The model I'm using gives an 85% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Each prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending as past behavior is often repeated.\"),\n    (\"education_and Employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and not pursuing college can limit opportunities for positive change and reduce risk factors like job stability or support network.\"), \n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide a sense of independence, but it can also increase vulnerability to stressors and potential negative influences.\"), \n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job during the year might limit financial stability and alternative opportunities for personal development or deterrence mechanisms.\"), \n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially recent marijuana use, can impair judgment and lead to impulsive decisions that increase risk of reoffending or self-harm.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household in an urban area may introduce stressors but does not directly correlate with higher risk without additional factors like alcohol abuse or unstable living conditions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
