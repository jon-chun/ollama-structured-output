    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with a conviction, which is already a red flag. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has multiple prior convictions at age 21, which usually means higher risk because older convictions can indicate more criminal history. That makes me lean towards high risk.\n\nHe's got a height of 6'1\" and weight 165 lbs. Not sure how that factors in directly unless there's something about his physical health or maybe if it affects his ability to perform certain jobs, but for recidivism, I don't think it's as significant as other factors like education or employment.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse, which might suggest he's not in a supportive environment. Maybe that could contribute to higher risk because lack of support can prevent him from getting help or staying out of trouble.\n\nHis educational background is lacking\u2014he has no high school diploma or GED and isn't college-bound. Without proper education, he might have fewer opportunities for positive roles and more time in the system, which increases recidivism chances.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, so maybe he doesn't have steady income or skills to move forward. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other negative choices.\n\nHis drug use history\u2014he used marijuana before but didn't get in trouble with harder drugs. However, recent feelings of low mood might be related to substance abuse. I'm not sure if that's a direct risk factor, but it could indicate underlying issues contributing to his behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother suggests he had a lot of stress or neglect at some point. That kind of environment can lead to behavioral problems and higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral compass, but it's not directly tied to criminal behavior unless there are issues like lack of faith leading him astray. But I don't think that's a strong risk factor here.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests, education issues, unemployment, living alone, and a past environment that might have caused problems. All these factors point towards high risk. So his chance of rearrest is likely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple prior convictions at age 21\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior convictions significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"living alone with no spouse\", \"medium\", \"Living in isolation may reduce support networks, potentially increasing risk factors for recidivism but not as directly correlated as other factors like education or employment status.\"),\n    (\"lack of educational background\", \"high\", \"A lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and contribute to higher rates of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"only one job held during the year\", \"medium\", \"Employment, especially with stable income, is crucial for reducing recidivism.
