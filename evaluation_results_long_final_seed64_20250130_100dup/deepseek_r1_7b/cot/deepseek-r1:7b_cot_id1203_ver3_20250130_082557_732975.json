First, his criminal history shows four arrests and two convictions, which is significant\u2014higher risk. His height and weight don't directly impact risk but are noted.\n\nHe's living alone without a high school diploma, indicating lower educational attainment, which can contribute to substance use issues. He's employed one job, so maybe not actively looking for more stable employment. Drug use in the past four years, especially recently, suggests ongoing or relapsing substance abuse problems.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother might have left him emotionally vulnerable, possibly leading to mental health issues affecting his behavior and decision-making. His spiritual belief could influence his coping mechanisms but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's causing significant stress.\n\nConsidering all these factors, each contributes to higher risk. The combination makes a strong case for high relative weight in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, which is strongly indicative of past behavior that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate, coupled with not being enrolled in college, suggests limited opportunities for positive development and self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job during the year but not actively seeking additional employment could indicate instability and potential lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \" drug use in the past four years, particularly in the last month, suggests ongoing substance abuse issues that could impact decision-making and behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Homelessness\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with limited family support due to being a single individual who has never been married adds to the isolation risk, which can influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Coping Mechanisms\", \"high\", \"Considering God is a significant factor but may also lead to mental health challenges or substance abuse as coping mechanisms, potentially affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Youth Experience\", \"medium\", \" living at a young age with five household members in an urban area could have provided emotional support and stability that's now lacking, increasing the risk of relapsing into problematic behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
