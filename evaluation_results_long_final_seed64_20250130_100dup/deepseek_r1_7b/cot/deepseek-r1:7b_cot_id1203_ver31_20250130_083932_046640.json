    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Repeatedconvictions are usually strong indicators of higher risk because they show a pattern of criminal behavior which can lead to future offenses. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs, but I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism unless it relates to other factors like substance use, which he does mention using marijuana in the past four years. That's a red flag because drug use can impair judgment, lead to impulsive behavior, and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's living alone, which is an interesting point.Living alone doesn't inherently make someone a risk, but it could mean he has fewer social supports or maybe less supervision. But since he's Black and from a young age lived with his biological mother in a household of five, that might indicate family support systems are weaker now, perhaps leading to higher vulnerability.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED, is not enrolled in college, which suggests he may have struggled academically or lost motivation. Without education, he might face challenges in finding employment and rebuilding his life after incarceration, increasing the risk of becoming a repeat offender.\n\nOnly holding one job during the year isn't great either. Employability affects reintegration into society and can provide stability. One job alone doesn't sound like much, especially if it's not stable or leading to long-term plans.\n\nHe feels down in the dumps sometimes, which could be due to various stressors\u2014his criminal history, lack of education, maybe family issues from growing up in a big household. His emotional state might affect his decision-making and ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: four arrests, no diploma, living alone, substance use, emotional struggles\u2014all point towards high risk. The prediction would lean strongly towards YES, with a very high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Recurrent Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating past criminal behavior which can predict future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues that could impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"While living alone does not directly correlate with recidivism, it may lack the social support typical of individuals from family-oriented households.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with not enrolling in college, suggests limited opportunities for future stability and employment.\"),\n    (\"Employment Record\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate instability, which can affect reintegration efforts and long-term stability.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Struggles\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down mood could stem from various stressors such as past criminal history or family issues, impacting decision-making and reintegrating into society.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
