    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old Black male. He has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's already concerning because more prior convictions usually correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis age is quite young\u201421. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive or less experienced, which might make him a risk, but it also depends on his current situation. He's living alone, which isn't great for stability, especially considering he has never been married. Living alone can lead to isolation and may contribute to substance use issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so he might be facing challenges in finding stable employment, which could affect his ability to reintegrate into society without further support. Plus, not having any college education might mean limited opportunities after release.\n\nOnly holding one job during the year is problematic because relying on just one source of income can be unstable. If that job were to be lost or change, he might struggle financially and could turn to substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years, which is a red flag for drug abuse. Even though he hasn't used it recently, continued drug use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behavior, and decrease self-control, all of which are bad signs for re-arrest.\n\nLooking back at his early life, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area when he was young. That kind of environment might have contributed to some behavioral issues or substance use problems. Urban settings can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates and stressors, which could influence his behavior.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This might suggest he's dealing with internalized religion or spirituality, but it's unclear how that affects recidivism risk. However, if it's a source of comfort, it might not directly contribute to substance use or criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior convictions (high), young age (moderate), living alone (medium), limited education (high), unstable employment (low to medium depending on job count), drug use history (high), and a family background that might correlate with other risk factors. The positive aspect is his belief in God, but I don't see how that directly impacts the risk.\n\nConsidering all these points, especially the high number of prior convictions, substance use issues, limited education, living alone, and unstable employment, it seems very likely he will be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to instability and substance use issues, increasing the risk of re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for stable employment after release, potentially leading to increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year could lead to financial instability and substance use as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood may indicate ongoing substance use issues that can contribute to criminal behavior or increased risk-taking behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
