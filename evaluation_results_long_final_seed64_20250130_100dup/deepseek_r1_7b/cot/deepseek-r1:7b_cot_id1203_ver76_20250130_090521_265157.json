    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivists usually have higher chances of reoffending after release, so that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis age is 21, which isn't the typical adult criminal age, but given his other factors, it might still be relevant. Young adults sometimes make impulsive decisions, so maybe medium to high risk here.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse or partner. Being single can affect support systems and opportunities for help after release, so that adds to the risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education. Without proper skills, finding employment might be harder, increasing recidivism chances\u2014so another high factor.\n\nHe's only held one job in a year. Job instability is a known indicator of higher recidivism because it ties into economic dependency and lack of career development.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) combined with recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors, which can contribute to criminal behavior\u2014so high risk from that.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with an urban background might have exposed him to various stresses or environments conducive to bad choices. His lack of supervision as a child is another indicator of higher recidivism potential.\n\nHis belief in God could be seen as a positive, but if he's struggling mentally, maybe it's not enough to offset other negative factors like his criminal history and living situation.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor points towards high risk. The prediction would lean towards high confidence that he'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"His four arrests and two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he's in his prime years, which can sometimes lead to impulsive decisions but isn't necessarily high risk alone.\"),\n    (\"living arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a spouse or partner may limit support networks and opportunities for rehabilitation, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can hinder job prospects and self-sufficiency, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in a year may suggest instability, but it's not necessarily the most significant factor without other supporting factors.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use history (marijuana) combined with feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"household size and background\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of five in an urban area might have exposed him to environments conducive to bad choices or stress, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing in God is generally seen as a positive factor, but without evidence of personal growth or support from that belief, it may not directly mitigate other negative factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
