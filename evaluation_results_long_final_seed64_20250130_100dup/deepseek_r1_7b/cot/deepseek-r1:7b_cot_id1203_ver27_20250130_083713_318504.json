    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems like a high number of negative past behavior, which should definitely contribute to a higher risk. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nHis age is 21, which is relatively young, but considering his multiple arrests, it might indicate he's in a situation where he doesn't have many opportunities yet. Maybe medium risk?\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight play into recidivism directly unless there are other factors related to health, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone suggests he has no immediate family support, which could increase his chances of falling into bad habits again. That's another high risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates because it can provide better job opportunities and self-esteem. So not having education would be a high risk factor.\n\nOnly one job during the year means he might have struggled to find stable employment, which could lead him back into trouble when his job doesn't provide enough support or motivation. High risk again.\n\nDrug use history is present\u2014he used marijuana before but hasn't recently. He felt down recently, which could be a sign of emotional issues that might affect his decision-making or ability to cope with stress. That's high risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area could mean he was exposed to a lot of stress and instability, which are known predictors of recidivism. High risk factor here as well.\n\nHe believes in God, but that alone doesn't predict risk\u2014it depends on how that belief affects him. If it's a positive force, maybe lower risk, but if he struggles with faith or uses it to justify bad behavior, it could still be high.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors pointing towards high risk are dominant. Four out of five factors (arrests/criminals, living alone, no education, one job, drug use) contribute significantly. The belief in God might mitigate a bit but not enough. So overall prediction is high risk with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (4+ times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate past negative behavior which can predict future criminal acts.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (Alone)\", \"high\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and self-esteem issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (1 job during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Single job might provide income but could also indicate past struggles which may influence future reliability in maintaining it.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana use, recent feelings of low motivation)\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, potentially leading to further criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
