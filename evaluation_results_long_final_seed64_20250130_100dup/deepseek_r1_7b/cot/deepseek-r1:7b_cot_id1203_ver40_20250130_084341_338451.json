    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old Black male with a rearrest recidivism within three years. He has four prior arrests and convictions, which is quite a significant factor. His age being 21 might indicate he's still developing his skills, but since he's already been in trouble multiple times, that's a red flag.\n\nHe's living alone, which could mean he doesn't have support systems to help him get back on track. Not having a high school diploma or GED suggests he might not have the necessary education for better opportunities, and being out of college exacerbates that situation. Only holding one job shows limited income stability and responsibility.\n\nHis use of marijuana in the past four years, especially recently, could point to substance abuse issues. The recent feelings of low mood might indicate depression or anxiety, which can impede his ability to reintegrate into society positively. Growing up in a household of five with his biological mother adds stressors; larger households often have more challenges that could affect his behavior.\n\nConsidering his religious beliefs and seeking God's influence for guidance is something to think about, but it doesn't directly contribute to risk unless there are underlying issues like mental health problems or lack of support from religious communities. \n\nPutting all these factors together\u2014past convictions, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance abuse, and family background\u2014it seems highly likely he will be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 4 arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 21, the individual is still developing life skills and may face challenges in achieving stability and positive outcomes.

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
