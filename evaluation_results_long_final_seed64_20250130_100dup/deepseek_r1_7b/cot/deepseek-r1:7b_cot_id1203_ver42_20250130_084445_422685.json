    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weight of each risk factor for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times with convictions. He's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs, living alone without a high school diploma or GED. He works one job, used marijuana in the past four years, feels down sometimes recently. He lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. He believes God plays a role in his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors again to analyze each:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: Four arrests and convictions. That's a strong indicator of past criminal behavior which can increase future recidivism.\n2. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically some of the time during the last month when he felt down. This could suggest occasional drug use, which might have psychological effects.\n3. **Mental Health Symptoms**: He mentions feeling down and sometimes so low that nothing cheers him up. This points towards potential mental health issues like depression or anxiety.\n4. **Household at Young Age**: Lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This might suggest family dynamics affecting his behavior, perhaps leading to unstable home environments as he grows older.\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational barriers can contribute to criminal behavior by limiting opportunities for positive development.\n6. **Current Employment**: He has only one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment is linked with higher recidivism rates as it reduces financial stability and motivation.\n\nNow, assigning a weight:\n\n1. **Arrest Record (High)**: Four arrests are significant; each prior offense increases risk of future offenses.\n2. **Drug Use (Medium)**: Occasional use might not be severe but can have negative impacts on mental health and self-control.\n3. **Mental Health Symptoms (High)**: Persistent feelings of low mood suggest potential for substance abuse or more serious mental health issues, which are strong risk factors.\n4. **Household at Young Age (Medium)**: Living in a large household might indicate family dysfunction but doesn't directly correlate as strongly with recidivism as other factors like drug use and mental health.\n5. **Education Level (High)**: Lack of education is a known predictor of criminal behavior, leading to more opportunities for engaging in illegal activities or risky behaviors.\n6. **Current Employment (Medium)**: Employed but only one job might lead to financial strain if circumstances change, increasing the risk of seeking alternative means.\n\nCombining these factors heavily towards high risk with some medium influences, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. The confidence is quite high because multiple strong risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the risk of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Occasional)\", \"medium\", \" occasional use can lead to psychological distress but may not be severe enough on its own, though it could contribute indirectly by affecting mental health\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Symptoms\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood and recent severe emotional distress suggest potential for substance abuse or more serious mental health issues which are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household at Young Age (Lived with Biological Mother in Household of 5)\", \"medium\", \" living in a large household may indicate family dynamics that could influence behavior, though it is not as direct a risk factor as others like education or substance use\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS Diploma/GED and Not Enrolled in College)\", \"high\", \" educational barriers often lead to unstable opportunities and behaviors contributing to criminality and increased risk of engaging in risky activities\"),\n    (\"Employment (One Job During the Year)\", \"medium\", \"current joblessness or underemployment can affect motivation and stability, increasing the likelihood of seeking alternative means or engaging in illegal activities\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
