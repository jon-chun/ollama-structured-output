    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which is definitely a red flag for recidivism. Prior convictions are strongly correlated with higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHis age might not be as much of an issue here since 21 isn't too young, but his living situation could play a role. He's living alone and hasn't married yet. Living at home can sometimes provide more stability, but being a young adult without support structures might increase vulnerability to other factors like substance use.\n\nHis education level: he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational barriers can limit opportunities for positive development and self-help resources, which could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nEmployment history shows he only held one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it limits economic stability and opportunities for personal growth.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor: he used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently, indicating potential substance abuse issues. Substance use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and lead to more impulsive actions that might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother could have had both positive and negative effects. While some family environments provide strong support, living with multiple siblings can also create stress and dependency issues. Additionally, if there are unresolved family dynamics or issues, this could influence his current behavior and decision-making.\n\nHis belief in God might suggest he has a higher level of accountability for his actions, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to those without such beliefs. However, personal spirituality can vary widely, and some individuals with strong faith may still struggle with moral or behavioral issues.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, unstable living situation due to living alone at a young age, limited education, poor employment history, substance abuse, and family background, but also some positive influence of his religious belief. The negative factors seem to dominate here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four prior arrests and one conviction, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at such a young age may have led to instability or increased vulnerability to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The lack of a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities for personal growth and self-improvement, potentially leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job during the past year may indicate limited economic stability and opportunities for positive development, which could contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (including marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues that can impair judgment and lead to impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, while not necessarily ideal, may have provided some level of stability compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with his personal life can sometimes indicate a higher sense of accountability and lower recidivism risk, though this is variable depending on individual circumstances.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
