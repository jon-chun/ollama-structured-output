    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me break down all the factors mentioned.\n\nFirst off, he has a criminal history with four prior arrests and two convictions. That's a solid indicator of past misconduct, which usually increases the risk of reoffending. So that's definitely high.\n\nHis age is 21, which isn't too young but also not old enough to have had significant life experiences yet. Maybe his age contributes less here compared to other factors.\n\nLooking at his demographics, he's Black in an urban area. While race can be a factor due to systemic issues, without more info on implicit biases or community impact, it might be considered medium here.\n\nHe's living alone, which could mean fewer support networks and maybe higher chances of relapsing after treatment. That adds to the risk.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower education often correlates with unstable lives, substance abuse issues, and possibly poorer job prospects\u2014all of which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nEmployment is another point\u2014he's only held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long could lead to dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism or lack of skills for new opportunities, increasing his risk.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood makes me think he might have ongoing substance issues. That's a red flag because substance abuse can impede treatment efforts and worsen behavioral problems.\n\nHis early life living with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he was raised in an environment that didn't provide him with much support or stability, which could affect his ability to reintegrate successfully after release.\n\nReligious belief might offer some self-soothing but doesn't necessarily protect against recidivism. It's more about personal coping mechanisms than external support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests, living situation alone, low education, unemployment, and substance abuse\u2014all these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (4) and two convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk but not as high as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Employed for only one job may indicate instability, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years and feelings of low mood suggest ongoing substance abuse issues that can impede recovery efforts.\"),\n    (\"Early Childhood Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with multiple family members at a young age may indicate lack of stability, which could affect reintegration efforts but not as directly as other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
