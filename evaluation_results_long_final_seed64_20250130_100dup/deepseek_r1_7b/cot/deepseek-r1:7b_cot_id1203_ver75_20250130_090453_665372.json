    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old Black male with multiple arrests and various factors contributing to his recidivism over the next three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has four prior arrests and two convictions. That's significant because recidivism tends to increase with more criminal history. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis age is 21, which might mean he's still developing coping skills, possibly leading to higher re-arrest chances. Medium-high confidence here.\n\nHe's living alone without a partner and doesn't have a stable environment. Instability often correlates with higher risk of relapse or seeking new opportunities, so medium-high.\n\nEducation-wise, no high school diploma or GED means limited opportunities, which can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. High confidence on this factor.\n\nHe's employed one job in the past year but doesn't have a steady income or support network, which could contribute to financial strain or other issues. Medium-high risk from this.\n\nDrug use history, particularly marijuana over four years, suggests potential ongoing dependency. This is definitely a high risk factor contributing to higher recidivism chances.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood might indicate substance abuse or mental health issues, both of which can impede personal growth and contribute to further crimes. High confidence here as well.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five in an urban area at a young age could have led to instability, neglect, or exposure to risk factors from an early stage. High risk due to the environment's impact on his development.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral guidance but doesn't directly correlate with reduced recidivism rates; however, it's not a strong protective factor either. Medium confidence here as it varies by individual beliefs and context.\n\nPutting all these together: four prior arrests (high), age 21 (medium-high), living alone (medium-high), no education (high), job history (medium-high), marijuana use (high), recent low mood (high), and family background (high). The prediction leans towards high risk with multiple strong factors contributing. Confidence is around 85% as most factors are pointing towards a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four prior arrests and two convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium-high\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is still developing life skills and may be more vulnerable to negative influences leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone in an unstable environment without a support network increases the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking new opportunities that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma and GED reduces his ability to secure stable employment and contribute positively to society, increasing the risk of involvement in the criminal justice system again.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium-high\", \"Employing only one job for a year without consistent income or support network may lead to financial instability or lack of motivation for positive actions that could prevent recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, particularly marijuana over the past four years, along with recent feelings of low mood, suggests ongoing substance abuse issues which can contribute to further criminal behavior and risk of re-arrest.\"), \n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of five in an urban area at a young age indicates potential exposure to risk factors such as neglect or instability that may have long-term consequences on his personal development and choices.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism rates, but it is noted as a factor that varies by individual context and belief system without providing strong protective measures against reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
