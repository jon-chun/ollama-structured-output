    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to evaluate the risk of a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times with a conviction. He's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. He's living alone, not married, no high school diploma or GED, working one job for a year, uses marijuana in the past four years, felt really down recently, had a tough childhood living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, and he believes God plays a role.\n\nFirst, let's break down each risk factor. Age might not be as significant here since he's young, but having multiple prior arrests could indicate higher risk. His lack of education is a big red flag\u2014lack of educational credentials often correlates with lower income, which can support substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nThe job situation\u2014he has only one job\u2014isn't great for someone who might be struggling to make ends meet or facing unemployment issues, but not directly a bad sign. Since he's using marijuana regularly, that could impact his ability to function socially and professionally. He mentions feeling down recently; this might point towards other mental health issues, which can affect recidivism.\n\nHis childhood living situation is concerning\u2014five siblings with his mother in an urban area. That kind of environment often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse and criminal behavior because of the stress or unstable home life. His belief in God might suggest he's religious, but that doesn't directly relate to risk unless it affects his motivation.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests (high), low education (high), marijuana use (medium?), recent feelings of low mood (maybe medium), and a challenging upbringing (high). The high factors are strong indicators. While some factors are on the lower end, the prior convictions heavily suggest he's more likely to reoffend.\n\nThe prediction is that there's a high risk of rearrest within three years because of the multiple past offenses, lack of education, substance use, and family background. I'd estimate about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (4) can significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism as they indicate past behavior that may predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for engaging in risky behaviors, including substance abuse and seeking legal help which could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) can impair judgment and social interactions, increasing the likelihood of making impulsive decisions that may lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"recent_mood_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for an extended period may indicate underlying mental health issues which could affect decision-making abilities and willingness to comply with legal processes or treatment programs.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five with a biological mother, particularly in an urban area, can be associated with higher rates of substance abuse and criminal behavior due to environmental stressors and instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
