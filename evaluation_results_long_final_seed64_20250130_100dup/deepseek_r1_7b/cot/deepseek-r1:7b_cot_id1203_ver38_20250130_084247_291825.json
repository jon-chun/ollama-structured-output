    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for this individual and then predict their rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive or have less life experience, which might make them more prone to making decisions that could lead to recidivism. So maybe medium risk because of potential for impulsive behavior and lack of stability due to still being in their late teens early twenties.\n\nHe's Black. Being minority groups often face systemic issues like discrimination, which can affect access to resources or treatment programs. This might slightly increase his risk compared to non-minorities with similar profiles, so perhaps medium weight here.\n\nFour prior arrests and a conviction. A history of multiple offenses is a strong indicator of recidivism. Each arrest adds to the chances of reoffending, especially since he's already done it four times. Definitely high risk from this factor.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 165 lbs. Being tall and possibly not very fit could mean he might engage in dangerous activities or have health issues that require medical attention, which could be a red flag for recidivism if not properly addressed. High weight here.\n\nLiving alone is a risk factor because isolation can lead to emotional distress, substance abuse, or neglect of basic needs. Plus, without a support network, he's more vulnerable to triggers like stress or life events that might push him back into criminal behavior. So high risk from living alone.\n\nNo high school diploma and not enrolled in college. educational deficits can contribute to low self-esteem, dependency on substance abuse, and lack of career opportunities, all of which are linked to higher recidivism rates. High weight for this factor.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness is a significant risk factor as it often correlates with higher rates of unemployment, substance use, and other negative outcomes that can lead to reoffending. High risk here too.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) especially in recent times could indicate potential for more serious substance abuse issues or unintended consequences from drug use, which might affect his ability to function or stay employed. Also, recent feelings of low mood might be a sign of underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism. High risk.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he's been exposed to multiple people who could provide emotional support but maybe also some neglect if not properly supervised. Additionally, growing up in an urban area can expose him to various stresses and potential criminal influences from an early age. These factors point towards high risk.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects his life introduces a variable. Some religious beliefs might influence behavior or decision-making, but it's less clear how this directly contributes to recidivism unless there are issues with moral development or lack of support in his environment. Maybe medium weight here because it's not as direct as other factors.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple high risk factors like prior arrests, living situation, education, joblessness, substance use, and being Black contribute significantly to a high likelihood of recidivism over three years. The prediction should be YES with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adulthood can lead to impulsive decisions and lack of life experience, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues faced by minority groups may contribute to recidivism rates compared to non-minorities with similar profiles.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"high\", \"Potential for dangerous activities or health issues that require medical attention, acting as a red flag.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Isolation can lead to emotional distress and neglect, increasing vulnerability to triggers and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education contributes to low self-esteem and dependency on substance abuse, linked with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Joblessness correlates with unemployment and negative outcomes that can lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and mood issues may indicate underlying mental health challenges affecting functionality and stability.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Exposure to multiple family members, especially in an urban setting, can expose him to various stresses and influences.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"The influence of religious beliefs on behavior or decision-making is less direct compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
