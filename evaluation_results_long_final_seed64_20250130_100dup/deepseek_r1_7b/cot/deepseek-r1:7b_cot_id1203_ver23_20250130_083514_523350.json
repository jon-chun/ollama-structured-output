    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a solid indicator of past trouble, which usually means higher recidivism risk. So that factor is definitely high.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't think race plays a direct role here; maybe it's more about his personal circumstances. He's 6'1\" and 165 lbs, which doesn't seem to relate directly to recidivism unless he has issues with weight management or something else, but the info given doesn't mention that.\n\nLiving alone might mean he's less likely to get support from family or friends who could help him stay out of trouble. But maybe it also means he's more isolated and vulnerable. I'm not sure how much this contributes, so probably medium.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED, which puts him at a disadvantage in getting jobs or opportunities. That increases the risk because without education, there are fewer chances for positive outcomes. So that's another high factor.\n\nNo college enrollment means he's not seeking higher education, which can limit his options and increase dependency on substance abuse. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHe only held one job during the year. Having a stable job is important for financial stability and reducing stress, so only having one might mean he's struggling financially or has other issues that could lead to more problems. High risk again.\n\nUsing drugs, particularly marijuana, in the past four years, especially feeling down recently, could indicate substance abuse issues. That's a strong indicator of potential for further trouble, so high.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area might have had some stressors or challenges that could affect his behavior. Urban environments can sometimes be more conducive to delinquency, but without knowing specifics, it's hard to say\u2014maybe medium.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it affects his decision-making regarding substance use or seeking help. If he's using drugs despite believing in a higher power, maybe that indicates other issues. But since the info is limited, I'll consider this as medium because it's not a strong factor here.\n\nPutting all these together: four high factors (criminal history, living alone, no education, job issues), two mediums (age of onset, household size), and one low or negligible (religion). The high factors seem to significantly increase the risk. So I'd lean towards a high prediction with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Individual has four arrests and two convictions, indicating past trouble which suggests higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support but also increase vulnerability to isolation and stress factors that could contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED reduces opportunities for positive outcomes, increasing the likelihood of further involvement in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"job experience\", \"high\", \"Only one job during the year may indicate financial instability which can be a risk factor for further issues\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use (marijuana) and feelings of low mood recently suggest potential substance abuse issues that could lead to further problems\"),\n    (\"household environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of five in an urban area may have had some stressors, but without specific details on family dynamics or support systems, it is considered medium risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
