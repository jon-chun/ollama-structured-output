    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the risk of this 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times. He's got a few factors that might contribute to his recidivism over the next three years.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's a solid indicator of past behavior issues, which usually means higher chances of reoffending. So that's probably high risk.\n\nHe's only 165 lbs at 6'1\", which is on the lighter side. But weight alone doesn't directly correlate to recidivism unless it's related to substance abuse or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNo prior marriage and living alone could mean he might not have a strong support system. Some stressors can lead to self-harm thoughts, especially if he's feeling down as described. That could increase his risk because mental health issues often precede recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Without formal education, he might face barriers like employment or housing, which are common triggers for recidivism. Plus, maybe he's not getting the necessary support to improve his situation.\n\nOnly one job during the year is good, but it might be temporary. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which can spiral into more crimes.\n\nDrug use in the past four years and recent use in the last month are red flags. Drug-related issues often involve multiple offenses and longer prison sentences, which don't help upon release.\n\nLiving with five people at a young age in an urban area suggests he might have experienced abuse or neglect, which can lead to behavioral problems as he grows up.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance use\u2014the risk is high. I'm going to predict \"YES\" on three-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Having four arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending due to established criminal behavior and history.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, indicates potential for increased risk of future offenses and substance abuse issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living Situation\", \"low\"|\"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network suggests some level of independence but may also correlate with higher stress or instability, which could be a moderate factor in risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, combined with not attending college, can contribute to challenges in employment and personal development that may increase recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year might indicate limited opportunities for stable living conditions and economic independence, which could be a factor but perhaps less significant than other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
