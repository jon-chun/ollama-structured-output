    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male reverting to criminal behavior within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, which definitely increases his risk.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't see how that affects the recidivism rate here unless there are systemic issues or biases in the system, but since it's not mentioned, I'll assume it's a neutral factor for now.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant to recidivism, so they can be considered low risk factors.\n\nHe's living alone, which might suggest he doesn't have immediate support from family, possibly increasing his chances of making bad decisions. But again, this is somewhat low.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this points towards potential lack of education, which could contribute to substance abuse issues but maybe not directly to criminal behavior unless it's tied to other factors like drug use.\n\nHe only held one job in the past year, so he might be underemployed or without steady income. This can lead to dependency on illegal activities as a means to support himself.\n\nDrug use history is significant\u2014four years ago and recently. Drug abuse often leads to other criminal behaviors like theft or violence, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nFeeling down for a long time suggests possible substance abuse issues, which ties into his drug use history but might also point towards emotional problems affecting his judgment.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with an urban environment could mean he wasn't exposed to positive influences and might have learned negative behaviors from that environment. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nHis belief in God might help him stay on track, but it doesn't negate the other factors. However, if he struggles with feelings of despair, his lack of faith could exacerbate those feelings, making him more prone to substance abuse or criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nPutting all these together: High due to multiple arrest convictions, drug use, living in a challenging environment, and possibly lack of support structures.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating past criminal behavior which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Four years ago he used marijuana and recently felt down, suggesting possible substance abuse issues that can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support structures but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless other factors are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
