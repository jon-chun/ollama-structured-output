    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old Black male. He has a history of four arrests and convictions, which immediately raises some red flags. Age-wise, he's in his early twenties, so his criminal history might indicate some unstable behavior.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. While that doesn't directly impact risk factors like weight or stature, it's worth noting if it relates to past issues, but I don't see a direct link here.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might not have a strong support system, which can sometimes lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. That ties into his drug use history of the past four years and recent marijuana use during the last month. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, relationships, and safety.\n\nHe never married and lives alone, so he might not have the same level of accountability or support that someone with a partner would have. This could contribute to substance abuse issues as well as potentially higher recidivism rates.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Without formal education, he might face barriers to better opportunities or treatment programs, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, indicating limited economic stability. Unemployment or underemployment often correlates with higher recidivism rates because individuals may not have the necessary skills or support systems to avoid criminal behavior.\n\nReligiously, he believes in God and thinks it influences his personal events. While this can be a protective factor in some contexts, his young age and living situation might suggest he's seeking guidance through religion as part of his struggle with substance abuse and other issues.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests, drug use, living alone without support, limited education, and low job stability. These points collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of four arrests and convictions indicates a pattern of past criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism, especially if there are underlying issues such as substance abuse or unstable personal circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and a history of drug use in the past four years suggest ongoing substance abuse issues, which are significant risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism but does not directly correlate with high risk unless combined with other factors like drug use or lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"Limited Educational Background\", \"high\", \"A lack of a high school diploma and GED, along with not being enrolled in college, places him at a disadvantage in accessing support systems and opportunities that could reduce recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for a year may indicate limited economic stability or skills that do not align with his future goals, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors to sustain criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide some level of guidance and support, which could potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with living alone and substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
