    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That\u2019s a significant red flag. Repeated arrest is usually linked to higher recidivism rates because it shows a pattern of behavior that could lead to more trouble if released.\n\nHis age is 21, which isn't too old yet, but it's also not too young for substance abuse issues or other behavioral problems. However, since he's only four times arrested, maybe the severity of his past convictions matters here.\n\nHe\u2019s 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. Not sure how weight affects risk directly unless combined with other factors like behavior or health issues, which I don't see here.\n\nLiving alone: living at home can sometimes lead to dependency issues or lack of support system if he becomes unstable. But since he's not married, maybe that's a neutral factor unless there are underlying issues.\n\nEducation level: He doesn\u2019t have a high school diploma or GED and isn\u2019t in college. Lower education often correlates with higher recidivism because it can lead to less employable skills or substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which might indicate inconsistency or perhaps he's facing challenges keeping employment. Unemployment can contribute to other negative behaviors that increase risk.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt very down recently. Drug use can have psychological effects and may lead to self-destructive behaviors, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nYouthful living situation: Living with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area could be related to family dynamics or environment that might influence his behavior later on. Urban environments sometimes have higher rates of certain issues due to social factors.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God is involved in his life, which can sometimes provide stability but also may correlate with substance abuse issues if he's struggling with addictions.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor seems to contribute positively to the risk. The criminal history is a strong indicator, followed by education and employment issues, drug use, and unstable living situation. All these point towards high recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Recurrent Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant past arrest record (4 arrests) with a conviction, which is strongly associated with higher likelihood of recidivism as it indicates previous involvement in criminal behavior that may lead to similar patterns upon release.\"),\n    (\"Youthful Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living at 18 years old in a household of five under his biological mother could indicate potential family dynamics or social circumstances that may influence future behavior, though the direct impact on recidivism is less clear compared to other factors like criminal history and education level.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year suggests limited income stability and employability, which can increase stress levels and substance abuse risks, indirectly contributing to recidivism but not as strongly as direct criminal history or education issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Admission to marijuana use in the past four years and feelings of low mood recently highlight potential substance abuse issues.
