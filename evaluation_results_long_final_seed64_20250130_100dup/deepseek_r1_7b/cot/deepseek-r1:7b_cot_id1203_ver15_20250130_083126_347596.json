    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment for a 21-year-old Black male. He has a history of four arrests and convictions, which is quite significant. That alone points towards high risk because recidivism tends to run higher among individuals with prior convictions.\n\nHis current circumstances are concerning. Living alone without a support network could mean he's isolated, which isn't great for his mental health or ability to get help when needed. Plus, he's never married and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might indicate lower educational attainment that can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's only held one job, so income stability is another concern. Unemployment or underemployment can lead to dependency issues and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nThe substance use history\u2014marijuana use over the past four years, especially feeling down recently\u2014is also a red flag. Substance abuse often comes with self-destructive behaviors that can contribute to other criminal tendencies.\n\nHis early life living with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he might have experienced some form of neglect or abuse, which can have long-term effects on his mental health and decision-making abilities. This could make him more prone to substance use issues or unstable relationships, all of which are risk factors for recidivism.\n\nHe acknowledges the role of God in his life, but that's a personal belief and doesn't directly relate to recidivism risks. However, it's worth noting if there were any prior interventions or support he received.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014prior convictions, isolation, lack of education, job instability, substance use, and early-life circumstances\u2014all point towards high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"isolation_and_support_network\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network could lead to feelings of isolation and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors or substance use \"), \n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can contribute to dependency issues and lower educational opportunities, which may correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job during the year may indicate instability, which can lead to dependency on employment and increased risk of engaging in other risky behaviors \"), \n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Use of drugs (marijuana) in the past four years, especially feeling down recently, could indicate potential for self-destructive behavior that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"early_life\u7ecf\u5386\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age and acknowledging the role of God suggests possible exposure to neglect or abuse, which can have long-term effects on mental health and decision-making abilities, increasing the risk of engaging in negative behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
