    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male with four prior convictions. Four convictions are significant because each one can increase the risk. Having multiple convictions often means more time served and possibly higher recidivism rates due to past behavior.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think his height or weight directly affect recidivism, so maybe this is a low factor.\n\nLiving alone with no family around could be medium risk because isolation might lead to substance abuse issues he mentioned. He hasn't married anyone, which probably means he's single and living on his own, but since he doesn't have any dependents, it's not as high of a risk compared to having children.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Education level is important because people with lower education might face more challenges in finding stable jobs and managing substance abuse, so this could be medium to high.\n\nOnly holding one job for the past year. Employing someone who's unemployed can increase stress and dependency on substances. Not having a steady income might make him turn to other substances when he feels down.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but recently felt low. Substance use is a clear risk factor, especially recent or frequent use which could impair judgment and lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This suggests he was raised in a multi-child environment, which might have had both pros and cons. Urban environments can be isolating but also offer opportunities for wider circles, though multiple children could have provided support or led to abuse.\n\nHe believes in God, so religious factors should probably be low unless there's evidence that religion is actively preventing him from engaging in risky behavior, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nPutting this all together: four prior convictions (high), substance use (high), lack of education and job stability (medium), living alone with no family (maybe medium), young age and urban environment (low). The strongest factors are the convictions and substance use. While the other factors aren't as impactful, they still contribute.\n\nSo overall risk is high because of the multiple prior convictions and ongoing substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has four prior convictions, which significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism due to past behavior and associated risks.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Regular use of marijuana and recent feelings of low mood could impair judgment and lead to impulsive behaviors that may contribute to criminal acts.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can hinder job stability and self-sufficiency, increasing the risk of dependency issues such as substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Employing someone who is unemployed for an extended period may lead to stress and substance use, but this alone does not significantly increase recidivism compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone with No Family\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network can exacerbate isolation and dependency issues, though the absence of family members reduces some risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
