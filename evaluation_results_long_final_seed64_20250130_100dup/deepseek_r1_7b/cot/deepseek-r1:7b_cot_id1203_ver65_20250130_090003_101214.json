    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems like a high number of past offenses, which should definitely increase his risk. High weight because each prior offense is a warning sign.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 165 lbs. Weight doesn't usually directly affect recidivism unless there are underlying health issues, but I don't see any here. Maybe it's just medium since it's not directly relevant.\n\nLiving alone could be a factor, but without more info like his living situation's stability or surrounding environments, it's hard to say. It might be low because it's an external factor without supporting evidence of positive aspects.\n\nNo high school diploma and no college enrollment. Low education often correlates with higher recidivism since there are fewer resources and support systems. So medium maybe? Wait, but being without a degree could be more significant than just living alone. Maybe it's medium to high because not having an education can impact his ability to find employment or housing.\n\nHe held only one job in the past year. That's low because having a stable job reduces stress and provides income stability, which are positive factors against recidivism.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but not recently. Some use in the last month with feelings of low mood. Drug use can affect mental health, possibly leading to more substance abuse issues or strained relationships. Medium risk because while he hasn't been high in the past, recent use might indicate potential relapse.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological mother in a household of five could be concerning. Being raised in such an environment can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health. High risk due to the number of people around him, which might lead to instability or neglect.\n\nConsidering God's influence, he seems religious but doesn't provide direct info on how it affects his behavior. Maybe low because religious factors usually support positive behavior more than deterrence.\n\nPutting it all together: The high number of prior offenses and living with a large family are strong indicators. Education absence is significant. Drug use might not be severe enough to cause immediate issues but could be a risk factor in the long run. So overall, his risk seems high.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple factors that significantly increase his risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **High number of prior offenses**: Four arrests and two convictions are significant warning signs indicating past behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. High.\n\n2. **Living with a large family**: Living in a household of five under an urban setting, especially at a young age, can contribute to instability or neglect, which might increase the likelihood of further issues. High.\n\n3. **Education absence**: Lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college can hinder opportunities for positive change and may lead to increased stress or substance abuse. Medium to High.\n\n4. **Drug use**: While he hasn't used heavily recently, occasional use could indicate potential relapse, contributing to a lower but still significant risk. Medium.\n\n**Prediction**: YES  \nThe combination of high past offenses, living in an unstable environment, and education gaps collectively points towards a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and two convictions indicate significant criminal history, which is a strong indicator of future recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with five family members in an urban area at a young age suggests potential instability or neglect that could contribute to increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college can hinder opportunities for positive change, increasing risk but not as directly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \" occasional marijuana use may indicate potential substance abuse issues contributing to a lower but still significant risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
