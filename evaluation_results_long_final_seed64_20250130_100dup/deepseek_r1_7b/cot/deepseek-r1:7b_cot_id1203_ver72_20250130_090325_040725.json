    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a case of a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. He's described as being around 6'1\", weighs 165 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, only held one job recently, used marijuana in the past four years, and sometimes felt really down in the past month. His early life was tough with five people under him at a young age in an urban area, and he attributes his experiences to God.\n\nFirst, I need to assign relative weights to each risk factor\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014and then use those to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet me start by breaking down each factor:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests and Convictions**: He has four arrests and is convicted. More past criminal history typically increases the risk of future arrest because it's a clear indicator of problematic behavior. So this should be high.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: He has used marijuana in the past four years, which can lead to substance abuse issues. Substance use can affect judgment and increase crime rates. This is medium but perhaps leaning towards high since he also mentions feeling down sometimes, indicating possible mental health issues that could tie into substance use.\n\n3. **Age at Which He Lived with Biological Mother**: At a young age in an urban household of five. Younger children might be more vulnerable to abuse and neglect, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates. This seems like high risk because it's a sensitive early-life factor.\n\n4. **Current Employment Status**: He's only held one job recently, maybe part-time or not actively looking. Unemployment or underemployment can lead to stress, which might result in criminal behavior if not addressed. Medium risk but could be higher depending on circumstances.\n\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher crime rates as it can limit opportunities for positive development. High risk because education is a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\n6. **Mental Health Symptoms**: He feels down sometimes, which could indicate depression or anxiety. Mental health issues are major predictors of recidivism since they can impede effective decision-making and self-control. High risk here.\n\n7. **Living Alone**: Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk but combined with other factors like unemployment or substance use might elevate it. Since he's already got high on some, this could be medium to high based on context.\n\nPutting these together:\n\n- **High Risk Factors**:\n  - Past Arrests and Convictions\n  - Age at Home with Biological Mother (Urban Environment)\n  - Education Level (No HS or GED)\n  - Current Job History (Only one job)\n  - Drug Use and Possible Mental Health Issues\n\n- **Medium Risk Factor**:\n  - Living Alone, though it's context-dependent.\n\nConsidering all these, his risk of rearrest is likely high. The multiple past issues in arrest history, education, living conditions, and mental health all point towards a high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"This individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Age at Living with Biological Mother\", \"high\", \"Living with an older biological mother in an urban environment at a young age may have exposed him to environmental factors that could contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education, including no high school diploma or GED, is a strong indicator of potential challenges in finding positive opportunities and contributing to societal issues which can lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mental Health Symptoms\", \"high\", \"Substance use and reported feelings of depression/anxiety suggest underlying mental health issues that could impede effective decision-making and self-control, increasing the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"While living alone does not inherently increase risk, it may interact with other factors like unemployment or substance use to elevate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Current Job Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for a year could indicate past instability but without further context on employability or support systems, the risk remains moderate.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
