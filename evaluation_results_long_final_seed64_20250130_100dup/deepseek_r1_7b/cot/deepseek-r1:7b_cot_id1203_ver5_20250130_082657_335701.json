    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old Black male with a history of four arrests and convictions. He's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs, living alone without a high school diploma or GED. He's only worked one job in a year and has used marijuana in the past four years. He feels down sometimes, especially recently. His early life was spent with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, and he believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each factor step by step.\n\n1. **Arrest History (High)**: Four arrests and convictions are significant. Recidivism often follows past criminal behavior.\n   \n2. **Drug Use (Medium)**: marijuana use over the past four years suggests substance abuse, which can impair judgment and contribute to unstable behavior.\n\n3. **Young Age of Conviction (High)**: Being arrested at 18 or 19 is a strong indicator of early exposure to criminal justice systems, possibly leading to more recidivism later on.\n\n4. **Living Alone (Medium)**: Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk but might limit support and resources, which could affect his ability to reintegrate positively after incarceration.\n\n5. **Education Level (High)**: No high school diploma or GED puts him at a disadvantage, both personally and legally, which can lead to more opportunities for reoffending.\n\n6. **Employment Status (Low)**: Only one job in a year might mean he's not actively seeking or maintaining stable employment, which is crucial for reducing recidivism.\n\n7. **Mental Health (High)**: Feeling down a lot could indicate underlying mental health issues that aren't addressed, increasing stress and negative coping mechanisms.\n\n8. **Household Size at Young Age (High)**: Living in a household of five suggests he might have experienced neglect or abuse as part of his upbringing, which can deeply impact his behavior and willingness to comply with laws.\n\n9. **Religious Belief (Low)**: While believing in God isn't a mitigating factor, it doesn't necessarily counteract negative life circumstances either.\n\nPutting this all together, the high-risk factors are dominant here. The arrest history, lack of education, substance use, young age, and household environment all point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"High\", \"Four arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which is a significant predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Medium\", \"Use of marijuana over the past four years suggests ongoing substance abuse, which can impair judgment and contribute to unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"Young Age of Conviction\", \"High\", \"Convictions at such a young age may indicate early exposure to criminal justice systems that could lead to more recidivism later on.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but might limit support and resources, affecting his ability to reintegrate positively after incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"High\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED puts him at a disadvantage both personally and legally, increasing opportunities for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"Low\", \"Only one job in a year suggests limited stability or actively seeking employment, which is crucial for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"High\", \"Feeling down a lot could indicate underlying mental health issues leading to stress and negative coping mechanisms that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"High\", \"Living in a household of five suggests possible experiences of neglect or abuse as part of his youth, deeply impacting his behavior and willingness to comply with laws.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
