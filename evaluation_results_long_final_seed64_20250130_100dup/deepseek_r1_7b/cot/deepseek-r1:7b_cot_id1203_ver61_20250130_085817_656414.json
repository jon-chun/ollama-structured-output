    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual. Let's break down his history first.\n\nHe's a Black male, 21 years old with four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant criminal history right there. Age might play a role too; being younger could mean he's more impulsive or less experienced.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6'1\" and 165 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out as particularly concerning in terms of weight, so maybe that factor is low to medium.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which means no family support. Lack of a stable environment could increase risk factors like substance abuse or lack of supervision.\n\nEducation-wise, he has no high school diploma and isn't in college. Without education, he might have limited opportunities and could turn to other substances as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year\u2014unemployment or underemployment can strain mental health and lead to substance use as a way to cope.\n\nDrug use history is present\u2014he used marijuana before and recently felt down, which might suggest some underlying issues. Recent feelings of low mood could indicate depression or anxiety, both of which can affect judgment and legal behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area adds stress. Younger siblings and living in a crowded urban environment can lead to instability and exposure to negative influences.\n\nConsidering he believes in God, that might provide some moral guidance, but the other factors seem more concerning. Maybe his spirituality could help mitigate risk if he's actively seeking positive change, but his current behavior doesn't reflect that.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance use\u2014all these points lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the individual's factors:\n\n- **Multiple Arrests and Convictions**: The history of four arrests and two convictions is a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to future issues. This factor should be considered as **High**.\n\n- **Unstable Living Situation**: Living alone with no family support increases vulnerability to substance abuse and other risk factors, contributing to a **High** risk assessment.\n\n- **Lack of Education**: Without a high school diploma or GED and not attending college limits opportunities for positive change, adding to the **High** risk.\n\n- **Drug Use and Mental Health Issues**: The use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues and mental health challenges, which are significant factors. This is also a **High** factor.\n\nConsidering all these elements together, the overall risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual is assessed as **High** with high confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"High\", \"The history of four arrests and two convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior that could lead to future offenses, increasing the risk of rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Living Situation\", \"High\", \"Living alone with no family support increases vulnerability to substance abuse and other risk factors associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Education\", \"High\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED and not attending college limits opportunities for positive change, contributing to higher risk of rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mental Health Issues\", \"High\", \"Substance abuse history and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential mental health issues that could impact judgment and legal behavior, increasing the risk of rearrest recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
