    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with two convictions already. That seems like a high number of prior offenses, which is definitely a red flag.\n\nHe's got some personal issues too: living alone, no high school diploma or GED, and only one job in the past year. That suggests he might be struggling to support himself, maybe facing financial instability or unstable employment which could contribute to substance use or other negative behaviors.\n\nHis history of using marijuana for at least four years, with some recent downward mood affecting his mood during the past month\u2014this could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to impulsive behaviors and self-harm.\n\nHe was raised in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. That might imply he's experienced family dysfunction or neglect, which are known predictors of criminal behavior and poor life choices that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral support but it doesn't necessarily protect him from substance abuse or risky behaviors if he's struggling with personal issues.\n\nPutting all these together: prior convictions (high), unstable living situation (medium), low education (low), recent drug use (high), family background (high). These factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest. I'm pretty confident, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to four prior arrests and two convictions indicating a history of criminal behavior that may contribute to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no high school diploma or GED, coupled with only one job in the past year, suggests potential financial instability and possible substance abuse issues which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana for four years, especially recent instances where he felt down, indicates ongoing substance abuse which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"high\", \"Raised in a household of five with biological mother issues may suggest family dysfunction or neglect, both of which are associated with higher rates of criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"moral support\", \"low\", \"Belief in God provides some personal support but does not necessarily mitigate the risks associated with prior substance abuse and unstable living conditions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
