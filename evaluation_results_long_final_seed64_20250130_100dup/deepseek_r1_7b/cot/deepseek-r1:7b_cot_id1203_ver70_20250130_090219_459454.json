    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor provided for this 21-year-old male and then predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black. From data, Black individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like police stops being more likely in predominantly Black areas and biased practices. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. Multiple arrests significantly increase the chances of reoffending within a short period. Definitely a high factor.\n\nAt 21, he's considered too young to commit serious crimes, but his history shows he might still do it. Young adults can be impulsive or involved in transient activities. So medium risk here.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs \u2013 not sure how this affects recidivism unless it relates to health issues leading to substance use. But given he's only 21, maybe low impact on recid.\n\nNever married and living alone don't directly point to criminal behavior but could indicate past stability issues. Maybe medium risk if he was unstable before.\n\nNo HS diploma or GED \u2013 lack of education can lead to not finding better opportunities or understanding the consequences of his actions. High risk as many without education might engage in illegal activities.\n\nOnly held one job during the year \u2013 low to no income support could mean he's relying on other means, maybe leading him towards substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nDrug use past four years, especially marijuana, and recent feelings of low mood. Drug use is a direct risk factor for reoffending due to potential substance-induced crimes or relapse. High risk here.\n\nHe lived in a household of five at a young age in an urban area \u2013 high social stress and exposure can lead to behavioral issues. High risk as urban environments often have higher crime rates and family dysfunction.\n\nBelieves in God, which might suggest he's looking for moral guidance but doesn't directly tie into recidivism unless he's prone to sin or unethical behavior. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk factors are his criminal history, being Black, lack of education, drug use, and family background. Medium on young age, living alone, joblessness. So overall, high confidence (78%) that he'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending within a short period.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Criminal justice disparities suggest that Black individuals may face higher rates of recidivism due to systemic issues such as over-policing in predominantly Black areas and biased law enforcement practices.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Although 21 is considered too young to commit serious crimes, his history suggests he could still engage in impulsive or transient criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Health Status\", \"low\", \"His height and weight at 21 years old do not directly correlate with substance abuse issues unless accompanied by other indicators such as drug use or mood swings.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse does not inherently indicate high risk but may suggest past instability which could influence current behavior and likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"A lack of education or GED can lead to a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, seeking employment opportunities, or substance use as a means of coping with life challenges.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job during the year may not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless combined with other factors such as substance abuse or unstable living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, especially marijuana, and recent mood issues suggest a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five at a young age in an urban area may have exposed him to high social stress and exposure to criminal environments, increasing the likelihood of behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Moral Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God does not directly correlate with recidivism but could influence his susceptibility to sin or unethical behavior based on personal circumstances and values.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 78\n}\n```",
