    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got to figure out whether this person is at risk of rearrest within three years. He's a Black male, 21, with four prior arrests and convictions. That immediately raises some red flags because re-arrest rates are higher for people with a criminal history.\n\nHe's only 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. While weight isn't typically a major factor in risk assessment unless it's related to substance use or health issues, but here he's using marijuana and feels down sometimes. Maybe that's contributing to his mental health issues, which could affect his ability to commit new crimes.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have the support system needed for re-arrest prevention. Being in a group household can provide safety and social support, so living alone increases risk factors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is linked to lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and community involvement. Without education, he might not have the skills needed for successful re-arrest prevention programs.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which is another indicator of low educational attainment since most adults with a GED or high school diploma typically work full-time. Reliance on only one job could mean instability if that job ends, making it harder to find alternative employment and support himself financially.\n\nUsing drugs for mood improvement in the past four years shows substance abuse. Substance use can lead to impulsive behaviors and mental health issues like depression or anxiety, all of which are risk factors for reoffending.\n\nHe's considered that God has some influence on his life, which might suggest he hasn't dealt with his personal struggles deeply. If he's having emotional lows, maybe he needs help but isn't seeking it, making him a risk.\n\nPutting this all together: high prior convictions (4), lack of education or support system, substance abuse, and emotional issues without seeking help all point towards a high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of 4 prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"age_and_living\u73af\u5883\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to higher risk due to lack of support networks, though not as significant as other factors like substance use or education level.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college increases the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or failing to gain necessary skills for successful reintegration.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held during the year may limit opportunities for stability and support, but not as significant as education or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues which are linked to increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_history_and_mentalHealth\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five from a young age and considering God as a factor may indicate deeper personal struggles that could impact decision-making and re-arrest risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
