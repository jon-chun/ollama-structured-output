    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, 21 years old with four arrests and two convictions. Age is usually a factor; younger individuals might have more impulsive behavior or less life experience, which can increase the risk. So that's probably medium to high risk.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor unless it's related to health issues, but he doesn't mention any. So maybe this is low risk. I'll put it as low.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse or partner could mean less support system. If he has family around him, that usually helps with getting out of trouble and rebuilding his life. But since he's living alone, I think that's medium to high risk because isolation might lead to more risky decisions.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which is a sign of lower socioeconomic status. That could contribute to higher recidivism rates. So this factor would be high risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year, but that's not much experience for re-entering society after incarceration. Maybe low to medium risk here because having some work history might mean he knows how to support himself, but it's still a point against him since he hasn't built connections yet.\n\nDrug use in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood during the last month could indicate substance abuse issues. Both factors are concerning for recidivism, so this should be high risk.\n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area might have shaped his behavior or environment. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or different social dynamics. However, since he's been through the system before, maybe this is medium to low risk compared to someone from a similar situation.\n\nHe believes in God, which could provide some moral guidance but doesn't directly correlate with lower recidivism rates unless he actively uses that belief. So perhaps no direct impact here; maybe it's neutral or not as high a factor. I'll consider it as low.\n\nPutting all these together: Black male, age 21, two convictions, living alone, no education, one job, drug use, recent low mood, and urban background. The main factors pushing him are the lack of education, living alone, prior convictions, drug use, and recent emotional issues. These seem to add up to a high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black male with four arrests and two convictions\", \"high\", \"Age is a significant factor; younger individuals are more likely to have impulsive behavior or lack life experience, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone at 165 lbs.\", \"low\", \"Weight isn't typically correlated with recidivism unless health issues are present.
