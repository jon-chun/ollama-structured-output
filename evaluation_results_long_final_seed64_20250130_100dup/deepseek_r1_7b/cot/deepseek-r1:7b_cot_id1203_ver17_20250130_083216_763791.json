That's significant\u2014multiple offenses usually correlate with higher risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant unless there's an issue with his health or substance use. He's single living alone, which can contribute to isolation and stressors that might increase recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational challenges often lead to unstable situations, maybe harder to find meaningful employment post release.\n\nHe held only one job recently\u2014job instability is risky because it leaves him dependent on the job for income, which can be volatile if he loses it again.\n\nDrug use history, particularly marijuana over four years but recent use, adds a risk factor. Substance abuse can lead to legal issues and self-destructive behaviors. His mood swings might exacerbate these problems.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with an urban environment suggests he was raised in a potentially stressful environment, which can have long-term effects on his behavior and mental health.\n\nHis spiritual beliefs, though not directly tied to risk, might influence his coping mechanisms or provide some support that could mitigate negative outcomes.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, job issues, substance use\u2014all point towards a high risk. I'll predict \"YES\" for rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which indicates a pattern of criminal behavior that can lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age_and_irc\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is relatively young, but considering other risk factors, this factor alone does not contribute significantly to risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"The lack of a high school diploma and GED certificate places him at a disadvantage in the job market and society, increasing the likelihood of involvement with the criminal justice system again.\"),\n    (\" employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job during the past year may indicate limited opportunities for stability or meaningful engagement with societal institutions which can contribute to risk but is not the highest factor here.\"),\n    (\" drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana over the past four years and recent usage, can lead to impaired judgment, increased risk of legal issues, and health complications which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\" household_size_and_environment\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five within an urban area at a young age suggests exposure to potential stressors such as poverty, lack of supervision, or family dysfunction, all of which can increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\" spiritual BELIEFS\", \"low\", \"While his belief in God may provide some level of guidance or support, it is not directly linked to criminal recidivism risk but may influence personal behavior and coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
