    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems pretty significant because past convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism. I remember reading that each arrest increases the risk of reoffending, so this should be a high factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism directly, but maybe it relates to other factors like substance use or health issues. Since he's not married and living alone, maybe isolation is playing a role, which could influence his behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education gaps often correlate with unstable lives, higher crime rates in certain areas, and more exposure to negative influences. This probably adds to his risk.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which might mean he's underemployed or struggling financially. Financial instability can lead to substance abuse, lack of support systems, and increased likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use is a big red flag here. He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down for parts of the month. Substance abuse can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and contribute directly to criminal behavior if it leads to illegal activities or violence.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five kids suggests he's part of a larger family, which might indicate he wasn't raised well or had inconsistent support. This environment could have long-term effects on his stability and decision-making.\n\nHe believes in God but feels down sometimes. While spirituality can be protective, feeling low without a strong support system might mean he's struggling mentally, which is another risk factor for recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, each of these factors points towards high risk. The criminal history alone makes me lean towards a high prediction. The lack of education, employment, and living situation combined with substance abuse further amplify the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, which strongly indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"The use of marijuana and feelings of low mood may contribute to impulsivity and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education (no diploma or GED) can lead to unstable lives, higher crime rates in certain areas, and more exposure to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"holding only one job for a year may indicate financial instability, which could increase the likelihood of substance use and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with limited support may contribute to isolation but does not directly correlate as strongly with recidivism compared to other factors like substance abuse or lack of education.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
