    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. He's got a lot going on, so let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: four arrests and two convictions. That's a solid indicator that he has a problematic past. Four arrests is already concerning because it shows instability or issues with the law. Convictions suggest he's had some impact on his life, maybe leading to more issues now.\n\nAge-wise, he's 21. Younger individuals can sometimes be more volatile. But since he has four prior convictions, that might make him a higher risk regardless of age. He's living alone, which could mean he's less monitored or supported, making him more susceptible to triggers like substance use.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked to better opportunities and lower recidivism rates. Without education, especially if he's not completing any programs, it can keep him in a cycle of poverty and possible drug use.\n\nEmployment-wise, he only held one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances as a way to cope, which is another risk factor. Also, if he's not engaging in any form of support or self-improvement, that could contribute to his instability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and recently felt down. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism. It can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to more risky situations, all contributing to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of five means he's part of a larger family. This could introduce a lot of stress or neglect, especially if the environment isn't positive. Plus, being raised in an urban area might have its own set of challenges that can affect behavior and opportunities.\n\nReligious belief in God: While this is a personal choice, it doesn't directly tie into criminal risk unless he's using religion as an excuse to avoid accountability or seek leniency from authorities. Without evidence he's actively seeking help through religious practices, it might not be a strong risk factor here.\n\nPutting all these together, his multiple arrest and conviction history, lack of education, unemployment situation, substance use, living in a potentially stressful environment, and young age all point towards a high risk. Each factor compounds the others, making him highly likely to reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and two convictions indicate a history of problematic behavior that increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Although 21, having multiple arrests suggests he may be more prone to instability despite his age.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce supervision and support, potentially leading to increased substance use and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, coupled with not attending college, places him in a cycle of dependency and future challenges.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate instability, which can be a precursor to substance use issues and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, and feelings of low mood, can impair judgment and increase impulsivity leading to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with five family members in an urban area may introduce stress or neglect, increasing vulnerability to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"While considering God as a part of his life, there is no direct evidence linking this to increased recidivism risk without further context about seeking help or religious practices influencing behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
