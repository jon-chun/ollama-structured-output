    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm faced with this risk assessment query where I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The user is a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert, so they're looking for a precise and well-thought-out analysis.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors provided:\n\n1. **Demographics**: 21-year-old male, Black. Age isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless there's a history showing otherwise, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in some contexts.\n\n2. **Previous Convictions**: Arrested 4 times and convicted. Multiple convictions are a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, which generally increases the risk level.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: 6'1\" and 165 lbs. While height and weight aren't typically direct factors unless combined with other metrics like BMI or body fat percentage, they don't seem to directly contribute here.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Housing**: Currently living alone, never married. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or instability, but it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with more engaged criminal behavior, which can be a red flag for recidivism.\n\n6. **Employment History**: Held only one job during the year. Joblessness is linked to higher risk of poverty and substance abuse issues.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years, with some recent use in the last month. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n8. **Past History**: Young age (21), lived with biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This indicates living conditions that might be unstable and could contribute to behavioral issues from a young age.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Considers God has something to do with his personal events. While this doesn't directly impact risk, it's worth noting for context about behavior guided by faith versus secular influences.\n\nPutting it all together: The individual has multiple prior convictions (4), which is a strong indicator of past problematic behavior. His lack of education and job history also point towards lower self-esteem or instability. Additionally, his recent drug use, especially marijuana, suggests ongoing substance abuse issues, which can be a significant risk factor for further criminal behavior.\n\nHis age, despite being young, might indicate he's still developing, but the other factors are more concerning. The living situation with his mother in an urban area of 5 could imply family dysfunction or exposure to adverse environments that contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems like a high risk individual. The multiple convictions alone make me lean towards \"YES\" for prediction, even if confidence isn't extremely high because some factors might be mitigating (like age). But given the combination of factors, I'll set confidence at 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
