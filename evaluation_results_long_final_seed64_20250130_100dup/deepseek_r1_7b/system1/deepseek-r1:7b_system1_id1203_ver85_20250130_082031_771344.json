    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. First, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is 21 years old and male, identified as Black. Age isn't inherently a strong indicator of risk unless considering recidivism rates among that age group, which can vary but might be low since he's relatively young. His race could imply certain societal risks or systemic issues, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number; multiple convictions often indicate past problematic behavior. Recidivism is a big concern here\u2014previous convictions can strongly predict future criminal activity.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. These factors don't directly relate to risk unless considering potential substance abuse, which ties into the next point.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently pose a high risk in itself but might indicate potential isolation issues, which could affect mental health or social support availability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college: Educational barriers can lead to unstable situations, possibly increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors due to lack of resources or opportunities.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Having a stable job is crucial for financial stability and overall well-being. Unemployment or part-time work alone might leave him vulnerable.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years, with recent instances in the last month. Drug abuse can severely impair judgment, increase risk of criminal behavior, and negatively impact mental health.\n\nMental state: He feels extremely down and has no coping mechanisms, which could lead to self-harm or suicide attempts. This is a red flag for high risk.\n\nLiving conditions: At 18 with five siblings in an urban area\u2014this suggests instability and potential exposure to negative influences. Young adulthood often brings changes that can be challenging without proper support.\n\nReligious belief: He believes in God, which might offer some support but could also be a source of coping if he's struggling mentally. However, it doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are deeper issues with his mental health or environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, each points towards significant risk. Multiple arrests, drug use, instability, and lack of education and employment all contribute to higher chances of reoffending or presenting other high-risk behaviors. Therefore, I'm confident that this individual presents a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
