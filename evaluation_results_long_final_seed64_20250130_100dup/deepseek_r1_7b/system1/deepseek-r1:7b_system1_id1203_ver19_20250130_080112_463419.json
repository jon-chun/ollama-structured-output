    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. So, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone based on the given information. The person is a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. He's described as having a height of 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He's living alone, never married, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, only held one job recently, used marijuana in the past four years, and had some really bad mood episodes during the last month where he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, and he believes God has something to do with his personal events.\n\nFirst, let's break this down. The person is Black, which can be a risk factor due to systemic issues and historical discrimination. He's been arrested four times, which could indicate underlying issues or past mistakes that might predict future behavior. His lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014is a red flag because it can lead to unstable situations if he doesn't seek help.\n\nHe's only lived alone since he was young, living with his mother in a household of five urban setting. This could suggest he's experienced family dynamics that might contribute to his current state. His mood issues are significant\u2014he felt so down for most of the past month. Mood swings and emotional distress can be linked to various factors like substance abuse, lack of support, or previous trauma.\n\nHe's only held one job, which suggests instability. Unemployment or underemployment often correlates with higher risk in various areas\u2014criminal activity, mental health issues, etc.\n\nDrug use is another indicator; he's been using marijuana for four years but not recently. But the mention that during the past month he felt so low and couldn't cheer himself up adds a layer of concern about his mental health or possible substance abuse impact on mood.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has some level of spirituality, which might help mitigate some issues, but it's offset by other risk factors like past criminal history and unstable family environment.\n\nConsidering all these together\u2014multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone, emotional distress, unemployment\u2014it seems like a high-risk profile. The multiple risk factors point towards potential for further issues in areas like reentry into society, mental health problems, or substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
