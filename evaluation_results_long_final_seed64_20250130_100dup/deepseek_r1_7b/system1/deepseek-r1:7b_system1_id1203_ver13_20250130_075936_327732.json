    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being in his early twenties can be associated with higher recidivism rates because of developmental and life experiences that are often tied to this age group. Being Black is a protected race and can influence risk assessment based on systemic issues, but it's more about the individual's circumstances than just his race.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest increases the chances of future criminal behavior as he might be influenced by past experiences leading to repeat offenses.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch, weighs 165 lbs. While height and weight can relate to other factors like metabolism or risk tolerance for certain crimes, they don't directly indicate a high risk without additional context.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and currently single. Living alone is generally associated with lower stability, which could contribute to higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors, such as substance use or criminal activity.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can leave him with fewer opportunities for positive engagement, potentially leading to involvement in the criminal justice system due to lack of skills or alternatives.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment is a key factor; having no income can lead to dependency on social services, which might also be associated with higher risk behavior if he's engaging in illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some of the past month. Substance abuse, particularly among young people, is linked to higher rates of criminal behavior as it can impair judgment and lead to impulsive actions.\n\nHe feels down a lot lately. Emotional distress or low mood could be related to substance abuse but also might indicate underlying mental health issues which are risk factors for more serious crimes if untreated.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Poor living conditions and family experiences can contribute to behavioral issues. Urban environments often have higher concentrations of crime and substance use.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his personal events. This could indicate a lack of faith or a belief system that doesn't address his perceived problems, potentially leading him to turn to other sources like drugs for relief.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (4), substance abuse (marijuana and mood issues), young age living in a large household, limited education, no job, living alone. All these factors increase the likelihood of high-risk behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
