    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for someone. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age 21 isn't particularly old, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates in some contexts, so that's something to note.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are usually indicators of problematic behavior or past legal issues, which might suggest a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch, 165 lbs. While these don't directly indicate risk, they're within normal ranges so no immediate red flags there.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and hasn't been married yet. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behavior or instability, but it depends on other factors.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can contribute to risky behaviors like drug use and lack of stability.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, which is not bad, but if that job was unstable or ended abruptly due to issues, it could be concerning.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and in the past month felt very down. Drug use can have immediate negative effects on health and legal status, increasing risk of further issues.\n\nHe experienced significant emotional lows recently, which might relate to substance abuse but could also indicate other underlying mental health issues that need addressing.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area suggests potential family dysfunction or exposure to a high-risk environment. Urban areas often have different social dynamics compared to rural areas and can impact someone's behavior.\n\nHe believes in God, which might be a protective factor against some risk behaviors, but it's also common for many, so not sure if that's significant here.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests (4) suggest past issues; lack of education and employment; drug use with recent negative feelings; growing up in a high-support environment but also potential family issues. While there are several risk factors, the number of prior convictions is substantial\u2014four times\u2014and living alone can sometimes indicate instability.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think this person does have a high risk score. His multiple arrests and other contributing factors likely increase his chances of reoffending or engaging in problematic behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
