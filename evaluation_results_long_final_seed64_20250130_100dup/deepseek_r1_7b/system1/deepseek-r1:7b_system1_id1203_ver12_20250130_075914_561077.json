    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. His height is 6'1\", weighs 165 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, only one job, uses drugs (marijuana) past four years, felt down recently, lived with his mother at age, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, the number of prior arrests is significant. Four times shows a history of legal issues, which can indicate criminal tendencies. Since he's convicted, this adds to the risk profile.\n\nHis race being Black might be an indicator due to systemic factors that could contribute to higher crime rates or community issues affecting him. However, without specific data linking his race directly to risk, it's more about personal behavior and circumstances.\n\nHe is 6'1\" and 165 lbs. While his height doesn't immediately suggest a risk factor like being too tall or short in a job setting, his weight could be relevant if he has health issues that might affect his job performance or living situation.\n\nLiving alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of depression or anxiety. He's never been married and is single now, so social support levels are low. This isolation could exacerbate mental health issues mentioned.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, indicating limited educational opportunities and potential for lower job prospects. Jobless status can lead to boredom or lack of purpose, increasing the risk of substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nUsing marijuana, especially recently, might be a sign of drug use which can affect mental health and decision-making. Feeling down for much of the month suggests possible depression or stress issues, which are comorbid with substance abuse and could lead to more risky behaviors like self-harm or suicide thoughts.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at an urban area in early life might have provided certain protective factors but also indicates potential exposure to negative influences such as crime or substance use. His belief in God suggests he has a personal spirituality, which can sometimes mitigate some risk factors if he's actively seeking help, but it doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple prior arrests (high risk), isolated living situation (could contribute to mental health issues), lack of education and employment (limited opportunities for positive engagement), substance use (potential for negative outcomes), and possibly underlying mental health issues. All these factors point towards a high risk level, so I'd lean toward YES with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
