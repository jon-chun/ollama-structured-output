    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk and respond with a JSON object. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 years old and male, identified as Black. Age-wise, being in his late twenties might be considered high risk due to potential life changes like parenthood or career peaks. However, it depends on other factors too.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Multiple convictions are a strong indicator of criminal history, which usually correlates with higher recidivism rates. So this points towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While this might be relevant in some contexts like physical crime involvement or maybe domestic violence, without more info on his behavior, it's hard to say. Maybe not as significant here.\n\nHe's living alone, which could mean he's less likely to get support from family or friends, possibly increasing isolation risk. But again, that depends on other factors too.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a known factor in recidivism. Not having a degree might indicate lower opportunities and higher chances of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Job instability can be a risk factor as it may lead to financial stress or lack of support systems.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is legal but could still have negative effects. Also, feelings of low mood for extended periods might indicate underlying mental health issues, which can contribute to risky behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of five in an urban area. Parenting challenges early on are known risk factors. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and social issues that could influence behavior.\n\nBelieving in God affects personal outcomes; some religious beliefs might offer moral guidance, but it's not directly tied to criminality unless there's evidence of sinning or deviant behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, no education, living alone, drug use, and a challenging early home life. All these point towards high risk. Confidence is very high because the factors are significant and point clearly towards risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
