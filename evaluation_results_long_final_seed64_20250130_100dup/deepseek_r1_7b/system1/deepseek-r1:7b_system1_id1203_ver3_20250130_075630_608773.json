    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black ethnicity. While race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's not inherently predictive without more context. So, I'm neutral on that point initially.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Repeated arrests are a strong indicator of past criminal behavior, which typically correlates with higher risk of reoffending. This is a significant red flag.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch, and he weighs 165 lbs. While physical characteristics can sometimes be used in risk assessments, they don't directly correlate with criminal tendencies unless combined with other factors like body fat percentage or prior behavior. So, this alone isn't enough to conclude high risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk, but it could suggest independence which might be a positive factor in terms of reliability if he has any support network elsewhere. However, this isn't a definitive indicator on its own.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a formal education could limit opportunities and might contribute to substance abuse issues, which we'll look into next.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability can affect mental health; holding multiple jobs is generally seen as beneficial for managing stress and responsibilities. Having just one job might indicate some instability or difficulty in finding steady employment, which could be concerning but not solely indicative of high risk.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana over the past four years and has used it within the last month. Drug abuse can severely impact mental health and contribute to other risky behaviors. This is a serious red flag that suggests he might engage in self-destructive or dangerous behaviors.\n\nHe expressed that at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Extended family living arrangements can sometimes provide different dynamics, but the urban setting may offer more exposure to stressors and less stability compared to rural areas. This could influence his mental health and risk-taking behavior.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has some role in his personal events. This religious affiliation might indicate a strong moral compass or belief system, which could mitigate risk if it leads to ethical decision-making. However, it's also possible that this belief could be misused or conflict with other aspects of his life.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and negative living situation. These points collectively strongly suggest a high risk of reoffending. The confidence is very high because the combination of arrest history, educational challenges, substance abuse, and unstable living conditions are all strong indicators in predictive models.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
