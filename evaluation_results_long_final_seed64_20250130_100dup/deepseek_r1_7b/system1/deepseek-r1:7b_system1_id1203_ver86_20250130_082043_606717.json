    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their criminal justice context. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and prior convictions. These are significant red flags as recidivism rates are often higher among younger individuals.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise concerns but his age might suggest limited life experience. He's living alone without a family, which could contribute to feelings of depression or loneliness mentioned in the risk factors. Not having a high school diploma or GED despite being 21 is concerning as educational barriers often predict higher recidivism.\n\nHis job history shows he's been unemployed for part of the year since not working and not going back to college adds to that. Drug use, particularly marijuana, especially in recent times, indicates possible substance abuse issues which can affect judgment and relationships.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he was raised by multiple people, which could lead to inconsistent upbringing or emotional challenges. Believing in God for personal matters might indicate spirituality but also could mean he struggles with mental health aspects not tied to religion.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past criminal history, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance use\u2014the risk assessment points towards a high likelihood of reoffending. I'll rate his risk as high with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
