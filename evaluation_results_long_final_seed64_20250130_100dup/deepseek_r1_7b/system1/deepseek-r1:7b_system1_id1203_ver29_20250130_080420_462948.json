    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is often associated with lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals, but it can also be a risk factor in certain contexts. However, being Black might have socioeconomic implications that could contribute to higher risk if not addressed properly.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of high risk because multiple arrests suggest a history of engaging in criminal behavior, which typically correlates with higher likelihood of future crimes or substance abuse issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While this might be relevant in some contexts like traffic violations, it's not directly tied to risk assessment unless there are specific factors related to his weight class that aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and currently unenrolled from college while also jobless for a year. Unemployment can contribute to high risk as individuals might turn to more dangerous activities when financially unstable or seeking better opportunities. Living alone without support can increase the likelihood of substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; those with lower education levels are more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to lack of skills or alternatives.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which might indicate unemployment and stress, further increasing risk factors such as substance abuse.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana) over the past four years. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism rates. Additionally, he felt so down in the dumps for some months that nothing could cheer him up\u2014this indicates low self-esteem or mental health issues, which are also high-risk indicators.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five people in an urban area at a young age. Living in such a large household might have contributed to family dysfunction, lack of supervision, and potential exposure to negative influences that could impact his risk profile positively.\n\nLastly, he mentions believing God has something to do with his personal events\u2014this indicates he's religious but doesn't specify if this is a protective or risk factor. Without more context on how his faith affects his behavior, it's hard to gauge its influence here.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (high risk), unemployment (moderate high risk), lack of education (high risk), substance use issues (high risk), and living in a disadvantaged environment (moderate high risk). Additionally, low self-esteem could also be a contributing factor. Considering the number and severity of these factors, especially the four prior arrests, this individual likely has a high risk profile.\n\nHis age is 21, which might seem young for high risk, but considering his circumstances, it's probably still appropriate to rate him as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
