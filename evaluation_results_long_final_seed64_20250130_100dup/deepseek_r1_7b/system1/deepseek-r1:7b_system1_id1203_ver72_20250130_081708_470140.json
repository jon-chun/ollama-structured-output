    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's Black. He's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each one can increase the risk because they show a history of legal issues.\n\nHe's described as \"black\" but not specifying any racial profiling context, so I'll focus on other factors. His height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't particularly high or low, and his weight is 165 lbs. No info on BMI, but maybe it's average for his age.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a red flag because isolation might lead to self-harm or increased risk of domestic violence scenarios. But he's single, so not sure how much that impacts him specifically unless there's a partner involved.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not in college. Education is often linked with better opportunities, so lack thereof could contribute to lower self-esteem or higher risk of substance abuse.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to poverty, which might be a stressor. Also, if he's unemployed for an extended period, it can affect mental health.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and some recent heavy drug use or substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential for further behavioral issues and could relate to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a complex family situation which can have emotional and psychological impacts. Living in such a large household might not be conducive to bonding or providing a stable environment.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life, so he has some level of religious support. But that might also indicate a lack of other social support systems like family or friends.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions, substance abuse (marijuana and recent heavy use), living alone, unemployment, and a complex family background can all contribute to higher risk factors. The individual's self-perceived positivity (believing in God) might not be enough to offset these negative aspects.\n\nConsidering each factor's weight, especially the four prior arrests, high risk is indicated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
