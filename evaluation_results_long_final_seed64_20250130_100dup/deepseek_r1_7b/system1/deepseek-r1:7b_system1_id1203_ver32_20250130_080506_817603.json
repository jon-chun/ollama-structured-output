    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this risk factor indicates high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age 21 might be in the early stages of life, but being Black could mean more resources or less? Not sure yet. He's been arrested four times and convicted\u2014so that's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase risk.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's health concern, but no info on weight management or related issues here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, so no support network. That could mean he might not have the same level of support as others his age who are married or in a relationship.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. He only has one job last year\u2014could be unstable income if that job changes or ends.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana before, but recently (past four years). That could indicate occasional substance use, which might affect judgment or relationships.\n\nHe feels down a lot in the past month; nothing cheers him up. That's concerning emotional distress.\n\nAt 18, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area\u2014family environment that might have had challenges, but I'm not sure how that affects risk.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life\u2014which could be positive or negative depending on context, but maybe indicates some level of spirituality.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple prior convictions (4), which can indicate a history of problematic behavior. Age 21 isn't high risk unless he's actively risky now. Drug use and emotional distress are concerning. Living alone without support might leave him vulnerable. Without education or stable employment, job instability could affect his ability to manage well.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I think there's an increased likelihood of high risk behavior. So the prediction would lean towards YES with a confidence level around 75%. I'm not entirely sure if it's higher than that because some factors are mitigated by living alone but others like prior convictions and lack of education might not be as easily mitigated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
