    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's Black. He's been arrested four times and convicted once, which is already a red flag. Being only 21 but having four arrests suggests he might have inconsistent behavior or maybe substance issues.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly concerning unless there's something about his health that could affect his risk level, but nothing jumps out here. He's single living alone; that's fine, but perhaps if he has a history of domestic violence, living alone increases risk, but it's not mentioned.\n\nEducation-wise, no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college points towards possible lack of stability. Being jobless for a year might indicate some dependency issues or maybe he's been struggling with substance use which affects his employment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. That could be a sign of substance abuse, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. Feeling down without anything to cheer him up suggests possible emotional issues that might lead to more behavioral problems.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area might have shaped his behavior. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher stress or different family dynamics, but it's not directly linked to risk unless there are other factors like lack of supervision.\n\nBelieving in God could be a positive influence, but if he's struggling with things that make him feel down, maybe his spiritual support isn't enough to counteract negative behaviors. He might need additional help beyond just religious guidance.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests (4), no education, living alone, substance use issues (marijuana and mood), young age of conviction, and possible behavioral instability from a complex household. These factors suggest he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
