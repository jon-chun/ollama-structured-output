    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the number of prior convictions is significant. Four arrests and two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of recidivism. That should lean towards a high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to his risk unless there's some underlying health concern, but I don't see any info suggesting that.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support networks and stress levels, which might influence behavior. However, since he's young (21), it's possible he doesn't have a family yet. Maybe not the most significant factor here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete his education. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it can limit opportunities and knowledge about alternative pathways. That's another point towards high risk.\n\nHe only has one job, which might mean unstable income. Joblessness or underemployment can contribute to substance abuse, emotional issues, and other risky behaviors.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years shows some substance use, though not heavily. However, he also mentioned feeling down for much of the past month without any cheers. This could indicate underlying mental health issues which might increase risk if left untreated.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area suggests he was raised in a non-traditional environment. This can sometimes lead to different life choices and might have a complex impact on his behavior, but it's not directly correlated with high risk unless there are other factors indicating abuse or neglect.\n\nHis belief in God could be a protective factor if he's actively seeking help, but the information given doesn't suggest that he is. If anything, religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with substance use if they lead to self-medication through substances like marijuana.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (4), lack of education, unstable job situation, and some history of drug use along with emotional distress are all significant risk factors. The living arrangement might not directly point towards high risk unless there's a known issue. However, considering the recidivism rates for individuals with multiple prior offenses, substance use, and emotional distress, I would lean towards high risk.\n\nSo, the confidence level should be fairly high, maybe around 75%. That means the prediction is YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
