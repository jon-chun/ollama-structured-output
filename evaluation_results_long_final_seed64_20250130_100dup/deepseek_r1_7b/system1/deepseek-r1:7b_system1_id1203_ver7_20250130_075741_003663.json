    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a risk assessment query for someone who's a minor and has multiple risk factors. The individual is 21, male, Black, arrested four times with convictions, and now living alone without a high school diploma or GED. He's employed one job but has substance use issues, especially marijuana over the past four years. His background includes living in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area, and he believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each risk factor step by step. The age being 21 is concerning because it's quite young, which might indicate he hasn't yet formed stable life choices. Being Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like police disparity and lack of access to resources in some communities.\n\nFour arrests and convictions are significant red flags. Each arrest adds to the risk of reoffending or becoming involved in further legal trouble, especially with no high school diploma. The lack of education could lead him into risky situations, possibly including substance abuse. His current living situation alone might not provide necessary support and could contribute to isolation and increased risk.\n\nHe's employed one job but that doesn't necessarily protect him if he struggles with burnout or substance use. Substance use issues are a strong indicator; even occasional use can impair judgment and decision-making, which are crucial in risky situations.\n\nLiving at 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs might not directly correlate to risk unless it's associated with weight management or other health issues, but the main issue here is his personal circumstances. His belief in God suggests he has some level of accountability, but if that belief isn't enough to prevent him from making harmful choices, that still leaves room for concern.\n\nHis past living situation at a young age in a large household could have shaped his personality and coping mechanisms without adequate support, which might contribute to him facing challenges now. Additionally, his belief in God doesn't negate his potential for substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all this together: four arrests, lack of education, living alone, substance use issues, young age, and a past adverse family environment. These factors significantly increase the likelihood that he's at high risk of further involvement in criminal activity or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
