    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let's go through the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male at 21 years old. I know there are some disparities in the criminal justice system regarding race and recidivism, so that's something to note.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Recidivism is high here because he already has multiple convictions, which might mean he's more likely to reoffend.\n\nHis physical description: 6'1\" and 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone are significant unless they relate to past behavior or access to certain resources, but nothing here suggests that right now.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, which might increase risk factors like drug use or further involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because people might not get the necessary support for substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances like drugs as a way to cope, which is a known risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really low for part of the month. Marijuana isn't illegal anymore, but chronic substance use can impair judgment and increase risk behaviors.\n\nHe had a traumatic experience at a young age when he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That kind of environment is often associated with higher levels of stress and emotional distress, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors later on.\n\nHis belief in God might suggest he has some level of self-control or faith, but it's not clear if that mitigates risk factors here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone, drug use, and a traumatic early life. All these points point towards high risk for reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
