    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identified as Black. Age seems young, which might not necessarily be a high risk on its own. However, being Black could be an indicator of potential risk based on historical data and systemic issues.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are typically associated with higher risk scores because they indicate a history of violating the law, leading to more significant legal consequences and possibly higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While physical characteristics like weight can sometimes be indicators in certain contexts, without additional information about body fat or other metrics, this might not have a significant impact on risk assessment.\n\nHe's living alone, which doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like previous criminal history or unstable living conditions. Living alone could contribute to stressors but needs to be considered alongside other factors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational barriers can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as substance use, which is another factor here.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability is important; having no job or just one job might affect his ability to support himself and make responsible decisions.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse can significantly impact mental health and decision-making abilities, increasing the risk of further issues.\n\nHe felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up during the past month. This indicates a potential low mood or depression-like symptoms, which are strong indicators of high risk as they can lead to risky behaviors like substance use or self-harm.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Young age and living with multiple family members could indicate exposure to a chaotic environment, which might contribute to behavioral issues later on.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This attitude can influence risk-taking behavior; if someone sees their actions as having divine judgment, they may be more likely to engage in risky or impulsive behaviors.\n\nPutting all these factors together, each points towards a high risk profile. Multiple arrests, lack of education, substance use, living situation, and possible mental health issues all combine to suggest a significant risk of reoffending or engaging in harmful behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
