    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 21-year-old male who's Black. He's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions which usually indicates higher risk because recidivism is high among people with multiple offenses.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs, but I don't know if that info affects the risk assessment directly unless there's something about his weight or stature contributing to risk. Since he's single and living alone, he might be more vulnerable as he doesn't have family support which can provide stability.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, so educational barriers could contribute to his instability. Also, he only held one job during the year, meaning he might struggle with financial independence or having multiple skills that could help him transition smoothly if released.\n\nHis drug use history is limited to marijuana over four years, which doesn't have severe physical effects like alcohol, but it can lead to mental health issues as mentioned when he felt down. This could affect his ability to manage daily tasks and maintain relationships.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That might mean he's experienced family dysfunction or neglect which is linked to higher recidivism rates among younger offenders, especially Black males who face systemic issues like racial profiling.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral support but doesn't directly correlate with lower risk scores unless it indicates strong values that could positively influence him after release. However, the context of his prior negative experiences complicates this.\n\nCombining all these factors: multiple arrests, education gaps, unemployment, living alone, family issues, and mental health challenges, it's clear he has several red flags pointing towards high risk. The presence of drug use adds to potential behavioral instability, which is a known factor in recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
