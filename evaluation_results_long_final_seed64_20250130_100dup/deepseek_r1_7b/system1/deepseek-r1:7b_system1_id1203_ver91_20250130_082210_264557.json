    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black. There might be some racial disparities in the justice system that could impact his risk assessment, but without specific data, it's hard to quantify. So I'll note that as a point to consider but not assign a confidence yet.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. Four prior convictions can indicate past behavior issues, which often correlate with recidivism. However, the number of convictions alone isn't everything; factors like what crimes were committed matter too.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 165 lbs. No direct link to risk here unless it's related to physical rehabilitation or something else not mentioned.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can be a risk factor if he lacks social support, which could affect his mental health and ability to stay connected with treatment programs.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Educational attainment is a significant predictor of recidivism; those without education often turn to criminal activities as their next step.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability can impact personal stability. If he's unemployed or underemployed, it might lead to financial stress or other issues contributing to risk behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a direct indicator of potential substance abuse, which increases the risk of various behaviors like theft, violence, etc., especially if it's relapsing.\n\nHe feels so down that nothing cheers him up. This could point towards depression or mental health issues, both of which are strong risk factors for self-harm and substance use.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five at a young age in an urban area. Small households can sometimes lead to higher stress due to the need to provide for multiple people, possibly leading to behavioral issues as a result.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his personal life. This might indicate a lack of secular support or a strong religious community that could help with substance use if available, but it's not inherently high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nPutting this all together: The four prior convictions suggest some past behavior, but the factors like drug use, recent feelings of low mood, and living in a large household might be more concerning. His lack of education and employment could contribute to unstable personal circumstances. His living situation and small family could stress him out, possibly leading to substance abuse or emotional distress.\n\nConsidering these points along with the number of prior offenses, I think this person has a higher risk. The confidence is based on multiple factors indicating potential for future issues, especially given his history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
