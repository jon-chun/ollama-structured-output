    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a history of criminal behavior which usually increases risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here unless there's something about his physical state that could affect behavior, but nothing stands out immediately.\n\nHe's 21 and living alone without a high school diploma or GED. Young age can sometimes mean less life experience, but not necessarily a bad thing if he's proactive. Living alone might increase vulnerability to certain stresses.\n\nThe fact that he used marijuana in the past four years is concerning because substance abuse often correlates with higher risk behaviors like theft or violence. Also, feeling down for extended periods could indicate deeper issues affecting his mental health and ability to function.\n\nHe was raised in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. That's quite a large family, which might suggest living conditions that aren't optimal\u2014maybe neglectful or stressful environments can impact someone's behavior as an adult.\n\nHis belief in God could be a strength if it provides guidance and stability, but sometimes religious beliefs can also mask underlying issues leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest convictions, substance use, living alone without much education or support. These factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
