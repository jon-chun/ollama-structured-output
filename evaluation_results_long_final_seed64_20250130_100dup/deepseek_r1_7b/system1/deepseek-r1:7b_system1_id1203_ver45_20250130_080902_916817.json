    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk and provide a JSON response with \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age 21 might be early in his life, but being Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, though I don't have specific data on that yet.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and convicted. That's significant because reoffending after release is a major risk factor for high-risk assessments. Four prior convictions are a red flag.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6'1\" and 165 lbs. While height or weight isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, combined with other factors like living alone might influence it indirectly.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living in a single unit can increase feelings of isolation, which could contribute to substance use or self-harm, especially if he feels lonely or overwhelmed.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is another big factor; lack of education often correlates with higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use or criminal activity again.\n\nHe has a job history of one job during the year. While having some employment can help, consistently working might indicate stability. However, a single job doesn't necessarily predict future issues unless he's been unstable before.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for parts of the last month. Drug use, especially if it's recent or frequent, is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse, which can lead to further legal issues or increased risk behavior.\n\nHis background: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to family dynamics that might have negative effects on his mental health or substance use. Urban environments sometimes correlate with higher rates of certain issues due to community factors.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal happenings, indicating he may have a support system but also could be influenced by other less supportive factors given some of the risk indicators above.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple arrest convictions (4), lack of education, living alone, substance use, and family background suggest high risk. The confidence is quite high because these are strong risk indicators that point towards a high likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behaviors again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
