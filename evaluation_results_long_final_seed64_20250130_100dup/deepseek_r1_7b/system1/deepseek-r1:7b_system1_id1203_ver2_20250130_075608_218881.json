    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male aged 21, arrested four times and convicted. Age might be a red flag because younger individuals sometimes have more impulsive behavior or less life experience, but since he has a conviction, that's a serious indicator of past problematic behavior.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. That's tall and relatively slim for his height, which doesn't directly contribute to risk factors unless there's an associated issue like weight problems.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might be more vulnerable or experiencing isolation, which can sometimes correlate with substance abuse issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete traditional education, which could indicate he struggled academically in the past. Not attending college shows a lack of commitment to further education or personal development.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Frequent joblessness is often linked to economic instability and substance abuse, as many don't have steady income sources to sustain themselves.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) especially over the past four years could be a sign of ongoing substance abuse issues. Additionally, his feelings of low mood for extended periods points towards potential mental health issues or substance use disorders.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age might indicate family dysfunction, which can influence behavior and mental health. Being raised in such an environment often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse and other risk behaviors.\n\nHis belief in God could suggest he has some level of faith, but this alone isn't a strong indicator unless it's inconsistent with his actions or substance use.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions at a young age is concerning. Drug use history, lack of education, living situation, and past emotional distress are all significant red flags pointing towards high risk. His family background might exacerbate existing issues but doesn't by itself indicate high risk without further context on how it affects his behavior.\n\nConsidering the factors, I'd lean towards a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
