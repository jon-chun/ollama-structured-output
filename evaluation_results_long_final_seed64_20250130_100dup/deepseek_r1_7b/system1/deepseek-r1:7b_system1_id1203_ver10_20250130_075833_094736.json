    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and convictions. He's 6'1\" and 165 lbs. Unmarried, living alone, no diploma or GED, currently not in college, has one job, used marijuana in the past four years, felt down sometimes recently, lived in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age, and believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, the number of arrests and convictions is significant. Four times arrested and convicted suggests a history of criminal behavior, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. That's a strong indicator for high risk.\n\nHis race being Black might contribute to systemic issues but without additional context like discrimination or previous convictions in specific areas, it's harder to assess fully here. However, race can be an indirect factor linked to higher arrest rates and risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to risk unless there's a health concern mentioned, which isn't the case here. He's not married or living with family, which might indicate some social isolation but doesn't directly point to criminal risk without more context on his mental state or interactions.\n\nHe lacks education, which can limit opportunities and contribute to substance use issues like marijuana use. Substance abuse often ties into higher risk behaviors such as drug-seeking or impaired decision-making.\n\nHe's been employed for one job, so maybe he's stable but perhaps struggling with work-life balance or personal challenges that led him astray. Recent marijuana use over the past month could indicate a potential slip up or ongoing substance use issues which can affect judgment and behavior.\n\nLiving alone at 21 suggests he might be facing some life challenges without support, which could increase stress and contribute to risky behaviors. However, this is more of an indirect factor related to overall well-being rather than direct risk factors.\n\nBelieving in God might suggest a focus on spirituality or personal accountability, but it's not directly tied to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues he's grappling with that aren't addressed here.\n\nPutting all these together: four arrests and convictions, lack of education, substance use, living alone. These points strongly indicate high risk. The other factors don't add significant weight either way beyond these clear indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
