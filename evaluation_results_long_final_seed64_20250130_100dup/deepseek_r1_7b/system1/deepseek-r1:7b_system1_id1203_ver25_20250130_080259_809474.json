    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with systemic issues that may contribute to higher risk in certain contexts, so that's a point towards a high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, which usually correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While his physical characteristics might not directly indicate risk, it's more about other factors here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can lead to social isolation, which may increase the likelihood of experiencing stress or loneliness that could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and sometimes lead to engagement with riskier activities as a means of survival or coping mechanisms.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having just one job might leave him more vulnerable if that job becomes unstable, leading to unemployment issues which can be risky.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, particularly marijuana. Substance use is a known risk factor for various complications and can also affect social connections and decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, he felt so down in the dumps during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. Persistent feelings of low mood or hopelessness are indicative of possible mental health issues, which can influence risk-taking behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Shared environment from such a young age might have exposed him to family dynamics that could contribute to behavioral issues later on.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his personal circumstances. While this doesn't directly point towards risk, religious involvement can sometimes correlate with certain types of behavior or support systems.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple arrests, lack of education and employment, substance use, living situation, and possibly underlying mental health issues\u2014all these contribute to a high risk profile. The individual has a history that suggests he may engage in behaviors that could lead to further complications or reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
