    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this risk factor for a person and determine if they present a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old Black male. Age 21 might indicate he's still in his prime years, but considering he has been arrested four times with convictions, that's concerning. Having multiple arrests and convictions can significantly increase recidivism risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. While this doesn't immediately raise red flags about physical health or safety concerns, weight is a factor in recidivism studies; however, without more context on his health or lifestyle, it's hard to tie directly to risk here.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might be less involved with community support systems, which are often protective against reoffending. But living situation can also indicate potential stressors if not properly addressed.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, indicating lower educational attainment. Education is linked to lower recidivism rates because it provides skills and opportunities that can aid in reintegration once released.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which might mean he has limited financial stability or support network. Unemployment for extended periods often correlates with higher risk of reoffending due to lack of income and potential stressors at work.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned other substances. Drug abuse can have serious consequences on personal and social stability, increasing risk of further legal issues or violence.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood for much of the past month could be indicative of mental health issues such as depression. Depression is a significant risk factor for substance abuse and criminal behavior, making him more prone to negative behaviors that could lead to further trouble.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at an early age in a household of five in an urban area suggests possible exposure to a variety of environmental factors\u2014both positive and negative\u2014that might influence his behavior. Urban environments often have higher rates of crime and substance abuse, which can increase risk.\n\nHis belief in God could either be a protective factor (religion often offers comfort) or indicate underlying issues if it's leading to neglect or unstable family dynamics. This is a bit tricky because without more context on how he interacts with his faith, it's hard to assess definitively.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests and convictions, low educational status, limited employment, living alone, drug use, recent emotional distress, early exposure in an urban setting, and mixed religious involvement. All these factors point towards a high risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
