    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who is predicted to have high risk based on criminal justice risk assessment. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male Black. Age-wise, he's young, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates. I should keep that in mind.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Four arrests are significant; it shows a history of problematic behavior which could increase the risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch, 165 lbs. No indication yet about his health or how these factors might influence behavior.\n\nNot married and living alone. Living situation can affect stress levels, social support, which in turn affects recidivism risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational disparities often correlate with higher risk due to limited opportunities and unstable environments.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment is linked to reduced recidivism because having a stable job can provide income and a sense of purpose, reducing the incentive to commit crimes.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. However, some drug use in the past can be a risk factor if it's inconsistent or if it leads to other issues like legal problems.\n\nMood: Sometimes feeling down for extended periods without any positive triggers can indicate emotional distress, which might lead him to engage in self-harming behaviors or substance abuse, both of which are risk factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 5 in a household of five. This indicates he was raised by his birth parents, but living in such an environment could have had mixed effects\u2014some positive like family support, some negative due to possible neglect or abuse.\n\nBelief in God: His spirituality might influence his behavior and decision-making, possibly providing guidance that could mitigate risk if he's using it constructively.\n\nPutting this all together: The number of arrests is a strong indicator. Additionally, factors like lack of education, employment history, substance use, and living situation contribute to higher risk. His age being 21 might not directly indicate high risk, but the other factors amplify it. Considering these points, I would predict that he has a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
