    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age 21 might be in a phase where he's just starting out, but it doesn't immediately indicate high risk. However, considering his past behavior and other factors could change that.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Repeated arrests are a red flag because they suggest substance abuse or criminal behavior that may put him at higher risk for reoffending.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch, 165 lbs. These aren't unusual unless linked to weight issues, but he doesn't mention health problems here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and not in a relationship. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, which might contribute to higher risk factors like substance use or antisocial behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education gaps are often linked to higher recidivism rates because they may lead to lower job opportunities or unstable living situations.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a steady job is important for financial stability, which can prevent stress and substance abuse. But if he's been unemployed, that could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt very down in the past month. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which are significant risk factors.\n\nHe feels down most of the time for much of the past month. Persistent feelings of low mood can point towards depression or other mental health issues, both of which increase risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nEarly life stress: He lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Small households in crowded areas are known to be associated with higher levels of stress, poverty, and exposure to negative influences, all of which can contribute to risk factors like substance use or antisocial behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God is involved in his life. While religious belief isn't inherently a risk factor, the environment he grew up in (an urban area) might have contributed to other negative factors that could be linked to religion's influence.\n\nPutting all these together, multiple risk indicators are present: past criminal history, substance use, living situation, lack of education and job stability. These points strongly suggest high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
