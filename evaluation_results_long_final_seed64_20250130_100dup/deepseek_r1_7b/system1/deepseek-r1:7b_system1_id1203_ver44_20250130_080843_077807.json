    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted once. He's 6'1\" and 165 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, only one job. He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. At a young age, he lived with his mom in a household of five in an urban area. He believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is significant\u2014he's been arrested four times, which puts him at moderate to high risk. Repeated convictions indicate past instability or substance use issues affecting his ability to function responsibly.\n\nHe has a body type that might suggest he's sedentary due to his weight and lack of physical activity, contributing to mental health struggles like feeling down. His low education level\u2014he didn't finish high school or get a GED\u2014suggests limited opportunities and potential for substance abuse. Not being enrolled in college indicates maybe he hasn't sought help.\n\nHis job is only one during the year; this could mean he's underemployed or struggling to find stable employment, which might tie into his use of marijuana as a coping mechanism. He uses marijuana regularly, which can lead to impaired judgment and increased risk of further legal issues.\n\nLiving with his mom in a household of five suggests he may have experienced neglect or abuse at home, especially since it happened when he was young. This environment could contribute to his emotional instability, making him more prone to mood swings.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some coping mechanism, but if his other factors are negative, that belief alone isn't enough to offset the risk of substance abuse and possible criminal behavior again.\n\nConsidering all these points\u2014criminal history, low education, substance use, unstable living situation, and personal beliefs\u2014it seems like he has multiple risk factors that point towards high risk. I would lean towards a YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
