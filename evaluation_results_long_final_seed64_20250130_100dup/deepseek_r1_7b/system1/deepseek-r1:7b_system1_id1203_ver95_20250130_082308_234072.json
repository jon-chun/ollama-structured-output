    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and a conviction. His height and weight are noted but not sure how relevant they are here. He's single, living alone, no diploma, and works one job. He uses marijuana and has been feeling down recently. He lived in a household of five with his mother as a child, which might indicate family issues or possible abuse. He believes in God.\n\nFirst, the number of arrests is significant\u2014he's been arrested four times. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending. Being convicted adds to that risk because past behavior often leads to future problems.\n\nHe uses drugs, specifically marijuana, which can impair judgment and contribute to antisocial behaviors. His recent feelings of depression might be a sign of underlying mental health issues, which can make him more susceptible to criminal behavior or substance abuse.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five could suggest family stress or neglect, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. Believing in God might indicate a lack of faith in other support systems that could help him change his trajectory.\n\nHe's 21, so relatively young, but the combination of factors like prior convictions, drug use, mental health issues, and family environment can still pose high risk. The GED or not having it shows limited education, which is another risk factor as education can reduce criminal tendencies.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems likely that this individual has a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 92\n}\n```",
