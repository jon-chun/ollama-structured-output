    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 21 years old, arrested four times and convicted. Age-wise, he's quite young, so maybe fewer life experiences which could affect recidivism rates. However, four arrests are significant\u2014higher than most in his age group.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs, but without knowing his BMI or past health issues, it's hard to assess here. Maybe not directly relevant unless there's a history of health problems leading to substance use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone; that could be due to social isolation, which might contribute to higher risk if he's struggling with mental health or substance abuse.\n\nLack of high school diploma or GED means he may have limited job opportunities or income, potentially making him more vulnerable. Not attending college could also indicate lower motivation or support system.\n\nOnly held one job in a year\u2014could be temporary, but maybe he's relying on it for stability. However, if the job doesn't provide enough income, it might not help with long-term issues.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) over the past four years and recent drug use could indicate ongoing substance abuse problems. He mentions feeling down and having no one to talk to during his bad mood, which suggests possible mental health struggles that substances might be trying to cope with.\n\nLiving with a biological mother in a household of five from a young age\u2014could mean growing up in an environment without close family support, possibly leading to isolation or behavioral issues as an adult. This could increase risk factors like substance use and lack of emotional support.\n\nReligious involvement\u2014he believes God plays a role in his personal life. This might provide some coping mechanisms but could also be a barrier if he's facing significant mental health challenges. If he doesn't seek help, it might not address deeper issues.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest convictions, substance use (marijuana and recent), living with a large household without close family support, possible mental health struggles due to isolation or lack of resources. These factors typically point towards high risk in recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
