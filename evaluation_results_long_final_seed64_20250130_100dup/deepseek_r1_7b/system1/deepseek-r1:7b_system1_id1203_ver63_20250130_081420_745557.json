    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk and respond with a JSON object. The person is a 21-year-old male Black, arrested four times, convicted, and has other risk indicators like drug use, living alone, no education, limited job history, and a troubled past.\n\nFirst, his multiple arrests and convictions are significant. Each arrest increases the chances of recidivism. Being Black might have some systemic issues affecting his outcomes, but without more info, I'll consider it as part of his background that could influence risk.\n\nAt 21 years old, he's still young, which might mean he can benefit from interventions or education. But since he has no high school diploma and isn't in college, educational support could help reduce future risks.\n\nHe uses marijuana, which is less severe than some other drugs but still present. His recent feelings of low mood might point to underlying mental health issues, possibly depression. If this is untreated, it could worsen his behavior or risk-taking tendencies.\n\nLiving alone without a support system like a family or friends can isolate him. He's considered God-related, which might suggest he's seeking spiritual help but isn't getting it elsewhere. This could be a red flag for not having mental health resources available.\n\nHe has a history of living with his biological mother in a household of five, which might indicate past neglect or abuse, affecting his current stability and future risk.\n\nCombining all these factors: multiple arrests, lack of education, drug use, isolation, and potential mental health issues. These are all indicators that could lead to high risk behavior if not addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind this prediction is as follows:\n\n- **Multiple Arrests and Convictions**: The individual has a history of four arrests and one conviction, which are significant indicators of past problematic behavior. This history increases the likelihood of future criminal activity or substance abuse.\n  \n- **Demographic Factors**: Being Black in the US can sometimes be associated with systemic barriers to rehabilitation due to factors like lack of access to resources and biased law enforcement practices.\n\n- **Drug Use**: The presence of marijuana use, particularly in recent years, is a concerning indicator that could lead to further drug-related issues or behavioral problems.\n\n- **Living Alone**: Living independently at such a young age without support from family or friends can contribute to isolation and increased risk of negative life choices.\n\n- **Education Level**: Lack of a high school diploma and not attending college despite only having one job during the year suggests limited opportunities for positive development and education.\n\n- **Mental Health Concerns**: The recent feelings of low mood could indicate potential mental health issues that, if untreated, could escalate into more severe behaviors or risks.\n\n- **Family History**: Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area might suggest past neglect or abuse, which can contribute to unstable family environments and increased risk of recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there is a high likelihood that this individual poses a significant risk. The confidence level is set at 85% due to the combination of multiple risk indicators pointing towards high-risk behavior if not addressed appropriately.",
