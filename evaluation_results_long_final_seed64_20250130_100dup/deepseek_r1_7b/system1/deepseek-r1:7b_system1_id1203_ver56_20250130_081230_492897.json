    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 21 might still be in a phase where he's just starting out, but it's also a time when individuals are more likely to make changes due to their youth. However, his race could be an indicator of systemic issues that affect him differently compared to others.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and is convicted. Having multiple arrests and convictions is a significant red flag because it often indicates unstable or criminal behavior. It's also possible that this person might still have a higher risk score due to the legal complications and potential lack of support systems.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't particularly unusual for someone his age, so I don't think this affects the risk assessment directly. Similarly, his weight of 165 lbs doesn't provide any specific insight into his behavior or health unless there's additional context about his BMI or health issues.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and is living alone. Living alone can have both positive and negative aspects. While it might offer independence in some areas, living alone without support could lead to feelings of loneliness or isolation, which are known risk factors for more serious behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment often correlates with higher stability and lower risk behaviors. Not having a degree or being out of school can contribute to instability, substance abuse, or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a stable job is crucial for financial stability and overall well-being. Employing just once might indicate limited opportunities or difficulties in finding better employment, which could lead to issues like unemployment benefits running out or lack of skills for advancement.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down multiple times recently. Substance abuse can significantly impact an individual's behavior, relationships, and mental health. Feeling down frequently is a sign of possible depression or anxiety, both of which are strong risk indicators.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in such a large household could lead to challenges like neglect, abuse, or lack of supervision, especially in an urban setting where resources might be limited. The mention of God playing a role might suggest some level of spirituality or belief but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the multiple arrests and convictions are particularly concerning as they often indicate past behavior that could lead to future issues. His living situation in a large household in an urban area adds to potential stressors. The lack of education and employment also contribute to instability. All these factors together point towards a high risk.\n\nI need to assess how confident I am about this conclusion. Given the presence of multiple arrest convictions, living with a large family in an urban setting, and other negative factors, it's reasonable to lean heavily toward high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
