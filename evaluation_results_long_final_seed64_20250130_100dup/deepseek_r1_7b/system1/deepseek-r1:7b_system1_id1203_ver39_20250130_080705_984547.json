    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black descent. I know that race can play a role in recidivism rates, though it's not the only factor. But being Black might increase his chances compared to others in similar situations.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That\u2019s a significant number of prior convictions, which is a strong indicator of high risk. Recidivists often have multiple past offenses, so this alone leans towards \"YES.\"\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an issue in some cases, without knowing his BMI or other health factors, it's hard to assess directly here.\n\nHe\u2019s never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk on its own but might suggest possible isolation which could contribute to substance use or depression as mentioned next.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn\u2019t in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree can increase risk, especially if it affects job opportunities or stability.\n\nHe\u2019s held only one job during the year. Employment stability is another factor; being unemployed for an extended period might lead to higher chances of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana use over the past four years and some recent severe mood swings. Drug abuse, especially with its association with mental health issues, can make him more susceptible to relapse or violent behavior.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could have contributed to social and emotional challenges, potentially making him a higher risk due to family instability or exposure to adverse environments.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral guidance but doesn't directly correlate with high risk. However, it's not without its own implications if he struggles with faith-based coping mechanisms for stressors.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, joblessness, drug use, and family background are strong indicators pointing towards a high risk. I'll set the confidence level quite high to reflect this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
