The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four prior arrests and convictions. His physical traits include being 6'1\" and 165 lbs, which might not directly impact his risk but could be noted as part of his profile.\n\nHe's single, living alone, so no family support nearby. He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college, indicating limited educational opportunities. He's only worked one job this year, suggesting inconsistent work history. His substance use, particularly marijuana in the past four years, could be a red flag for drug-related issues.\n\nHis recent feelings of depression are concerning\u2014he felt down for most of the past month. This could affect his mental health and ability to function. His early life was spent living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That might have shaped his personality or provided some protective factors, but given the circumstances, it's still a point to consider.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life, which could be a positive factor if it leads to positivity, but it also shows he has some spiritual connection that may aid in decision-making.\n\nConsidering all these factors: four arrests and convictions (very high risk), lack of education and employment (moderate risk), living alone with no support network (high risk), recent substance use (increased risk due to potential for addiction issues), and recent feelings of depression (high risk). His early life circumstances might mitigate some, but the higher risks dominate. \n\nI should rate this as a high risk with confidence around 85%. The factors like prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, substance use, and current emotional state all point towards significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
