    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given criteria. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Four arrests are significant; that's multiple convictions which can lower self-esteem but maybe also indicate past issues that could affect his behavior now.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs\u2014no indication of physical issues here, just noting the stats.\n\nNever married, living alone\u2014that might suggest some level of independence or perhaps an unstable family environment. But without more info, it's hard to say if this is a risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Being educated can reduce recidivism, so lacking education could increase risk but depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nHe has held one job during the year\u2014not much work history, which might mean he hasn't sought opportunities recently, possibly leading to more substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, especially if it's ongoing or relapsing. Since he used some during the past month, that's concerning\u2014frequency of drug use can be a strong indicator.\n\nHe felt so down and couldn't find cheer for part of the past month. This could indicate depression or anxiety, which are serious mental health issues linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nYoung age\u2014he lived at 17 in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. Young adulthood often lacks life experience, which can be both a plus and minus. Living with multiple family members might suggest instability if the parents aren't supportive or contributing positively.\n\nBelieves God is involved\u2014so he's religious but doesn't necessarily align that with positive behavior; could also mean he's dealing with personal issues that haven't been addressed.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, drug use, mental health issues like depression/anxiety, and perhaps a lack of support system. These factors are strongly linked to higher risk of reoffending. The presence of any of these should lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThe individual presents multiple risk indicators: past criminal history, substance use (marijuana), recent drug use during the month, and signs of mental health distress. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of reoffending or involvement in further criminal behavior.\n  \nConfidence is based on the presence of multiple risk factors that are strongly associated with recidivism. The individual's history includes four arrests, current substance use, recent emotional distress, and living circumstances potentially contributing to instability. These points significantly increase the likelihood of high risk.\n\nAnswer: ```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
