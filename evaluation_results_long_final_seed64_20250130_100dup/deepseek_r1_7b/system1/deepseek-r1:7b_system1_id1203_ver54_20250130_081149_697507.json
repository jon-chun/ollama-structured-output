    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from a Black background. While race can be a factor in recidivism studies due to systemic issues, at this point, I'm not sure if it's enough on its own. He has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which is significant because each arrest adds to the criminal history, indicating past problematic behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs, but without knowing his BMI or how he maintains his weight, it's hard to assess if obesity is a risk factor. Also, he's single living alone, which can be isolating and potentially increase stress, though I don't have data on how that ties directly to recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not completing education often correlates with higher recidivism rates as there may be fewer opportunities for positive changes after incarceration.\n\nHe has one job, which is better than not working at all but could also indicate some dependency issues if that job isn't stable or sufficient to support him financially.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years. Some recent drug use can sometimes correlate with higher risk as it might lead to ongoing substance abuse problems. However, recent use during the last month seems concerning because substance abuse often leads to other behavioral issues that could increase risk.\n\nHe felt very down for most of the past month. Persistent negative mood can contribute to self-harm thoughts or actions, which are serious indicators of high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Youngage living conditions and being in an urban setting might expose him to various risks like higher crime rates or unstable environments, which could impact his behavior and future criminality.\n\nLastly, he believes God has some influence over his life. While religious affiliation can be a protective factor, without knowing how that affects his current behaviors, it's hard to gauge its direct impact on risk.\n\nPutting all this together: four arrests, two convictions, lack of education, recent substance use, emotional distress, and living in an unstable family environment. These factors point towards high risk. The confidence level is 85% because these are strong indicators but not absolute without more context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
