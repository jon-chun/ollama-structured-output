    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male at 21 years old, arrested four times and convicted once. Age isn't too concerning unless there's a history of recidivism, which seems like there is with four prior arrests.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6'1\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how significant that is on its own; maybe related tojuvile delinquency stats? Doesn't jump out as high risk.\n\nHe's single living alone. Living situation can be a factor, but without more info on any issues there, it's hard to gauge.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so this could increase risk. Maybe contributes to higher chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year; part-time maybe? Unemployment can be a risk factor if it's consistent, but only holding one job might not be enough on its own.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to further problems like theft or violence. The recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues, which also increase risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 5 in a household of five in an urban area. That's quite a large family setting, possibly indicating he was raised by relatives who might not have provided the same care and support as biological parents do. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or unstable families, which could affect his risk.\n\nBelieving in God: This is more about personal spirituality than an indicator of criminal behavior. However, if he's struggling mentally due to recent low mood feelings, this belief might offer some coping mechanisms but isn't directly a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: His prior convictions, lack of education, substance use issues, and unstable living situation all point towards higher risk. The personal belief in God doesn't add much here. Considering everything, he's showing characteristics that could indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
