    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone involved in the criminal justice system based on their description. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 years old and male, Black. Age might be a consideration because younger individuals sometimes pose different risks compared to older ones. But since he's only 21, which is relatively young, maybe that doesn't carry as much weight on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of potential for recidivism. Each arrest represents an interaction with the system, so four already suggest some level of trouble.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. While that might relate to other factors like physical activity or health issues, it doesn't directly tie into criminal behavior or risk assessment here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be linked to social support levels; however, without more information on whether he has a stable environment, this factor is less significant.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often inversely related to recidivism. People with lower education levels might have fewer opportunities for positive employment and may engage in riskier behavior if they can't access support or resources.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which suggests limited income stability and could lead to financial stress, potentially increasing risky behaviors like drug use or illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: he has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known predictor of recidivism. It can impair judgment, lead to unstable relationships, and contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nIn the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates a high level of emotional distress or depression, which can affect decision-making and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 5 in an urban area. Early experiences in poverty and living conditions can have long-term effects on behavior, potentially making him more prone to negative influences.\n\nHis belief in God: while this is a personal faith aspect, it's not directly linked to criminal risk unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems that aren't addressed by his belief.\n\nPutting all these together, the multiple arrests, lack of education, job instability, drug use, emotional distress, and early challenging home environment all point towards high risk. I would rate this as a strong yes with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
