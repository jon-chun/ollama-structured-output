    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and convictions. His demographics are significant here\u2014being Black can influence recidivism rates. He's not married and living alone, which might increase vulnerability.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED, possibly due to barriers like poverty or lack of access to education. Working one job is positive, but his drug use in the past four years, especially recently, could be a red flag. His recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying issues affecting his mental health and ability to function.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother suggests exposure to a variety of environments that could impact his development. Additionally, he attributes his experiences to God, which might influence his coping mechanisms but also indicates possible emotional instability.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the risk level appears high. His background and recent issues point towards a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
