    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 21 years old, with four arrests and prior convictions. Age-wise, being in his late twenties could mean he has had several life experiences that might contribute to substance use or other issues. But let me look at each factor individually.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. That's a bit on the taller side but not extremely tall for someone of his age, so maybe not an indicator yet unless combined with weight issues. He's living alone, which could contribute to isolation or stressors in the environment.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED, so he might be facing educational barriers that could affect his stability and opportunities. Not attending college could mean limited skills or exposure to positive influences.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Unemployment for a significant portion of time can lead to financial instability, which in turn might increase substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt low mood recently. Substance abuse often correlates with higher risk of other criminal behaviors or health issues, which could impact his reliability if he's involved again.\n\nHe feels down for much of the recent time. Mood swings can be a sign of mental health issues or stressors that aren't being addressed. This could lead to self-harm thoughts or behaviors, increasing risk.\n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of five people suggests he's been part of a multi-parent household since childhood. While this might not directly correlate to high risk, it's something to consider along with other factors like family dynamics and support systems.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a positive influence but could also mean he doesn't seek help from alternative sources if things go south.\n\nPutting all these together: four arrests, prior convictions, substance use, lack of education, joblessness, living alone, and personal issues. These factors often indicate a higher risk of reoffending or involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning includes multiple factors indicating a high risk: prior criminal history, substance use, lack of education and employment, living situation, and personal issues such as mood swings and family background. These elements collectively suggest a higher likelihood of involvement in the justice system again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
