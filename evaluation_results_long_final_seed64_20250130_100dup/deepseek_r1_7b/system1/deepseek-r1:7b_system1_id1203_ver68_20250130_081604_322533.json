    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with this risk assessment query where a user is asking me as a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert to determine if certain risk factors indicate a high risk. The response needs to be only in JSON format with \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors provided:\n\n1. **Demographics**: 21-year-old male of Black heritage.\n   - Race can influence behavior and risk because of societal factors like systemic discrimination.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: 4 arrests, including a conviction.\n   - Multiple prior convictions are typically strong indicators of higher recidivism risk.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: 6'1\" tall and 165 lbs.\n   - While physical attributes aren't usually predictive unless linked to other factors like past behavior or living conditions.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Housing**: Living alone, never married.\n   - Living alone can be a sign of instability, which might increase risk due to potential issues with mental health or substance use.\n\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college.\n   - Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism; not having a degree could indicate higher risk if used as an excuse for past behavior.\n\n6. **Employment**: Held one job during the year.\n   - Employed individuals might be more motivated to change their behavior, so this alone doesn't necessarily raise the risk but may depend on other factors.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years; felt down recently.\n   - Drug use is a significant risk factor for re-offending. Recurrent drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which are linked to higher recidivism.\n\n8. **Past Living Situation**: At young age, lived with biological mother in a household of five in an urban area.\n   - Growing up in such a setting might have had negative influences on mental health and behavior, potentially increasing risk factors like anxiety or depression.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God is involved in his personal life.\n   - While religion can provide support, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues that aren't addressed by religion.\n\nPutting all this together:\n\n- The individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of past problematic behavior. These factors alone suggest a high risk.\n- Drug use is a red flag because substance abuse often correlates with higher rates of reoffending.\n- Living in a household of five could indicate potential family dysfunction or stressors that might contribute to behavioral issues.\n- Age at 21 is early, but combined with other risk factors like multiple arrests and drug use, it suggests he's just beginning his journey which might make him more prone to further issues.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the confidence level should be high. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with a confidence of around 85%. That seems reasonable because while some factors are mitigating (being employed, living alone), others like prior convictions and drug use heavily increase the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
