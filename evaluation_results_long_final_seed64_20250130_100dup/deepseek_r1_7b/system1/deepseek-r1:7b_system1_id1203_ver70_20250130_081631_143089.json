    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate whether these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male from Black. He's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each one can increase risk. \n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk but maybe could be associated with issues like substance abuse if they're not justifiable, which I'll consider later.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which puts him at a higher risk for isolation and potential emotional distress.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers can affect employability and independence, increasing risk factors.\n\nHe has only held one job recently; part-time work might lead to financial instability if it's not sufficient support.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) over the past four years is concerning but not severe yet. However, recent use during the last month indicates current substance abuse, which can impair judgment and increase risk behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, living with five people in an urban area might have contributed to his behavioral issues or social isolation as he got older. He associates God with his personal events, which could be a positive motivator but also suggests a possible lack of other support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (4), single living alone, limited education and employment, current substance use, and early family environment contribute to high risk. The factors point towards significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
