    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black descent. While race can be a factor in risk assessments, it's important to consider it alongside other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which typically indicates higher recidivism risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics are average height and weight for his age. Doesn't immediately suggest anything major on its own but context from other factors might change that.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living situation can impact stability and support network, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers can contribute to substance use, instability, and higher crime rates.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment continuity is crucial for financial stability and reducing recidivism, so this might indicate lower stability.\n\nHe uses drugs, specifically marijuana in the past four years, which could lead to legal issues, health problems, and family relations. This could also affect his mental health as indicated by feelings of low mood that he feels cannot be lifted.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Extended family living can sometimes provide support but might also expose him to certain pressures or environments that could impact his well-being and decision-making.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. Religious beliefs can offer coping mechanisms for stress and trauma, which might mitigate some risk factors.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions (4), lack of education, unstable living situation, drug use, and low self-esteem from feeling down often. These factors typically point towards a high risk of reoffending or involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
