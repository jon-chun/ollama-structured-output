    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and a conviction. His physical traits are average height and weight, living alone without a spouse, no diploma or GED, only one job, drug use in the past four years, and some recent deep mood issues.\n\nFirst, his criminal history of four arrests is significant. Repeated arrest suggests instability, which can increase risk. Being Black might influence societal perceptions but isn't inherently predictive unless there's systemic bias involved elsewhere.\n\nHe's 21, so relatively young, but with multiple arrests, indicating trouble early on. His living situation alone at an urban area could mean limited support network and isolation, contributing to higher risk factors like anxiety or depression.\n\nHis lack of education is concerning\u2014he\u2019s not even completing high school or GED\u2014which might affect his employability and ability to get involved in supportive programs.\n\nHe's employed only once during the year, which is low. Joblessness can lead to dependency on social services and possibly substance abuse issues if that's how he supports himself.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, could be a sign of underlying mental health issues or self-medication without professional help. Recent mood swings suggest possible depression or anxiety, which are serious mental health indicators tied to risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother might have had emotional challenges; this history can affect his own mental health and behavior patterns as an adult.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, age, education level, living alone, drug use, mood issues, and family background\u2014it's clear he has multiple risk indicators. These points together suggest a high risk of involvement in the criminal justice system again or experiencing other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
