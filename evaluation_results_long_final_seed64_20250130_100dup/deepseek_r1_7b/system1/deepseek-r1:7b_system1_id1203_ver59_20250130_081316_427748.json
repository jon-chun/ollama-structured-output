    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male Black individual who has been arrested four times and convicted. His height is 6'1\" and he weighs 165 lbs. He's living alone, not married, no high school diploma, not in college, worked one job recently, used marijuana in the past four years, felt really down during the last month, lived with his mom at age 5 in an urban area of five people, and believes God is involved.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: four arrests and a conviction. That's significant because recidivism rates are high for repeat offenders. This suggests he might have underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior again.\n\nHis socioeconomic factors: living alone with no high school diploma or GED means he might be in a tough economic situation. Unstable employment could contribute to his lack of motivation and higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe uses marijuana regularly, which is a drug use issue. Drug abuse can impair judgment, self-control, and relationships, all of which increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood for much of the past month point towards underlying mental health issues. Depression or anxiety could affect his decision-making and ability to function effectively in society.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban setting might indicate family dysfunction or exposure to adverse childhood experiences, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he's religious but doesn't provide direct insight into his risk factors. However, it's worth noting that some religious individuals still engage in risky behaviors despite their faith.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, socioeconomic issues, drug use, mental health concerns, and family background\u2014the individual appears to be at a high risk of reoffending. His past behavior patterns indicate instability and potential for further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
