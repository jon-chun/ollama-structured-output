    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of African American descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism, it doesn't inherently make someone a high risk unless there's evidence of systemic issues or discrimination. So maybe that's not enough on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and is convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which definitely increase the risk of reoffending. Each prior offense can signal higher chances of struggling with substance abuse, emotional issues, etc.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly relate to risk unless there's a history of health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and is currently single. Living alone can contribute to isolation, which might lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational barriers can prevent him from accessing better opportunities, leading to further involvement in the criminal system.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness often correlates with higher risk of becoming involved in the criminal justice system again, especially without support networks or opportunities for retraining.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt low for part of the last month. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behavior, emotional instability, and increased risk of further substance use.\n\nEmotional state: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five, which might have led to attachment issues or family dysfunction. He acknowledges God's influence on his life, which is positive but doesn't negate underlying issues.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (4), lack of education (no diploma), living alone, substance use, and possible emotional challenges from past family experiences all point towards high risk. The presence of multiple risk factors without significant mitigating factors makes me lean towards a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
