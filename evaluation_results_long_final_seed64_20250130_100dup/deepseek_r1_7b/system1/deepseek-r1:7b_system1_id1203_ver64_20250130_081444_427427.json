    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given criteria. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age-wise, being younger might actually reduce recidivism rates since he's still developing skills and life experiences. However, race can sometimes be an indicator in some contexts, but I don't see any systemic issues mentioned here, so maybe it doesn't heavily contribute to risk.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each one increases the likelihood of reoffending. So this is definitely pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. Not sure how that relates, but maybe he's in good health or maybe there's an association with certain criminal behaviors like drug trafficking based on his physical attributes. Not immediately clear if it contributes to risk, so I'll note this as a consideration.\n\nHe is living alone, which can sometimes be linked to higher crime rates due to isolation, making him more vulnerable to committing crimes. This could increase the risk assessment.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education levels are often associated with lower recidivism rates because they provide skills and opportunities. Not having an education might make him less likely to get involved in the criminal system, so maybe this lowers risk. But it's not as strong as prior convictions.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other activities that contribute to criminal behavior. So this is another factor pointing towards high risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, and in the last month felt very down. Substance abuse often correlates with higher crime rates, including violent or impulsive behaviors. This is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHis history includes living in a household of five at a young age in an urban area. Co-residing with multiple family members could lead to instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of support and increased stress.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has a personal view of what's right or wrong, but this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless it's tied to other factors like substance abuse or lack of motivation towards positive actions. However, it might counteract some negative tendencies.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions (4), living situation (single, maybe unstable), education level (low), unemployment (only one job), drug use (recent and significant), and age (young but not a risk factor on its own). The strongest indicators are the prior convictions, drug use, and limited education. These factors significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nSo, despite some mitigating factors like living alone and maybe having no prior positive experiences, the presence of multiple negative factors makes this individual's risk assessment high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
