    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on the given criteria. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, age 21, arrested four times and convicted once. Being of color can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues in the justice system, so that might contribute to high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6'1\" and 165 lbs. That puts him at a higher body weight, which is common for his age but doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there's evidence of ongoing health issues or other factors. He hasn't been married and is living alone, which might suggest he's not in a stable environment, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing education can lead to unstable employment and higher chances of engaging in risky behavior. Plus, being without a support network could make him more susceptible to negative influences.\n\nHe has only held one job during the year, which might mean he's either unemployed or underemployed, both of which are risk factors. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can lead to chronic stress and lack of purpose.\n\nHis drug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years, so that itself is a risk factor. Substance abuse can impair judgment, increase criminal liability, and have harmful effects on personal well-being. Additionally, he mentioned feeling down for much of the past month without any cheers, indicating possible mental health issues which might contribute to risky behavior.\n\nLiving alone at a young age with his biological mother in an urban area could expose him to various influences that might not be positive. Urban environments can have higher concentrations of crime and poverty, which are risk factors themselves.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has some level of religious support, but if that's the only support system, it could mean he lacks other social or familial support, increasing his vulnerability to negative influences.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions, education gaps, unemployment, drug use, living alone with a past that includes significant stressors. These factors point towards high risk behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
