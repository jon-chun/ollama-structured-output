    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male Black individual who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which might be considered at risk because he's still young but has had multiple arrests. Each arrest could increase the likelihood of more serious issues as he gets older.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which can be a risk factor due to systemic inequalities and potential for higher recidivism rates in certain areas.\n\nHe's been arrested four times before conviction, so past criminal history is definitely a red flag. Recidivism is high among people with multiple arrests.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch at 165 lbs might be a sign of health issues or lack of proper nutrition, which can affect his ability to manage substance use and other factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone increases the risk of isolation, which can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education gaps often correlate with higher rates of incarceration and substance abuse.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, indicating possible economic instability. Unemployment can lead to substance abuse, lack of support system, and other risk factors.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is a mild substance but could indicate potential for more severe drug use or misuse. Also, his recent feelings of low mood might suggest depression or stress, which are linked to substance abuse and risky behaviors.\n\nHe experienced adverse childhood conditions at age 15-17, living with five family members in an urban area. This exposure can lead to mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, all of which increase risk.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some coping mechanisms but doesn't necessarily reduce risk; in fact, religious factors can sometimes contribute to substance abuse or risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, substance use (past four years), living situation, and adverse childhood experiences all point towards a high risk. The combination makes me highly confident he's at significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
