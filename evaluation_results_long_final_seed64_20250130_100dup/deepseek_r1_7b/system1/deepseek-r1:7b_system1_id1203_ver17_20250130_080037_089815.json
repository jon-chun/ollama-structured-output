    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which might be relatively young, but considering he has four prior convictions, that's significant. Each arrest can have long-term impacts on his risk profile.\n\nHe's Black, so I should consider any racial biases or data that might influence his risk assessment. However, without specific statistics, I'll focus on the given factors.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. No mention of weight issues, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nNever married and living alone could indicate a lack of support system, which can be a risk factor as he might turn to other sources for help or stability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests he's behind in education, which can affect his employability and self-sufficiency. Not attending college shows a lack of commitment to further education or professional development.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, so maybe underemployed or facing unemployment, which could impact his financial stability and ability to seek help if needed.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years might indicate substance abuse issues, which can lead to legal problems, health issues, and social problems. He also admitted to feeling down for much of the past month; perhaps this is a sign of mental health struggles or low self-esteem, which could affect his ability to manage daily tasks.\n\nLiving at age 15 in a household of five with his biological mother might have had significant family dynamics that could influence his current behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nLastly, he believes God has some role in his life. This could be a positive motivator but might also indicate a lack of other support systems or religious communities nearby if he's struggling.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests increase the risk. His drug use and emotional state are concerning. His living situation and lack of education and employment are red flags. Considering all these factors, I lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
