    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's break down each of the risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, he's quite young, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in some contexts. However, that might vary based on other factors like where he lives or his background.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convictions. That's already a significant number of prior convictions; each arrest is a red flag. Having multiple convictions increases the risk assessment score because it shows a history of trouble with the law.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch, weighs 165 lbs. No direct info on weight or BMI here, but height isn't particularly concerning unless combined with other factors like body composition.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor as it may indicate lack of support network which could contribute to substance abuse or isolation issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational challenges can lead to unstable situations, possibly linked to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Unemployment for that long with no attempt at further education might suggest he's struggling economically and could be at risk of becoming a statistic in the cycle of poverty and crime.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years, which is concerning on its own as substance abuse can lead to other criminal behaviors or self-harm. Also, feeling down for much of the month might indicate deeper issues affecting his mental health, possibly leading to more risky decisions.\n\nAt a young age (21) lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a tight home environment which can lead to neglect if conditions are poor or lack of supervision, contributing to higher risk factors like substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. This might indicate he's seeking religious support but could also suggest he's dealing with deeper personal issues that aren't addressed, leading him towards more risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, drug use, living in a tight home environment, young age without much support or education\u2014these are all high-risk indicators. The presence of prior convictions alone should be enough for a high risk assessment. Considering the other factors, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
