    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. His factors like living alone, not having a high school diploma or GED, only one job, substance use especially marijuana, and a troubled upbringing with his mother in a large household suggest he might be at higher risk. His age also means he's still developing socially and emotionally, which can lead to more impulsive decisions.\n\nThe fact that he hasn't married yet and lives alone could put him at risk of isolation or emotional distress. His lack of education and employment history adds to potential instability. Substance use is a red flag; even if it's marijuana, it might indicate underlying mental health issues or coping mechanisms affecting his life negatively.\n\nHis past convictions and recidivism history also make him more likely to reoffend. The urban environment he grew up in could expose him to risk factors like crime, drugs, and lack of support systems. Additionally, his personal beliefs about God might influence his coping strategies but don't necessarily mitigate risk unless there's evidence of strong supportive networks.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the risk isn't extremely high, it's definitely on the higher side compared to someone with fewer issues. I would rate this a 65% confidence that he poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
