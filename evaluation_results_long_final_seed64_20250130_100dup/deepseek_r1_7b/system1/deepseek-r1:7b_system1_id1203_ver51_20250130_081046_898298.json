    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the individual described. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male at 21 years old, arrested four times and convicted once. Age-wise, being 21 isn't too young, but having multiple arrests can be a red flag. Recidivism rates are higher for re-offenders, so that might contribute to high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. That's not an outlier in terms of weight category unless it's affecting his health, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe this doesn't directly impact the risk assessment much.\n\nHe's living alone, hasn't been married, so no family support structure. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are other factors involved. He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often a factor in recidivism; having less education might make him more vulnerable to making impulsive decisions.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which could mean he's either unemployed due to circumstances or not actively seeking opportunities. Joblessness can contribute to economic instability and higher risk behavior.\n\nDrug use history: He admitted to marijuana use in the past four years and felt down for parts of the last month. Drug use can have psychological effects and might influence decision-making, potentially increasing risk. However, it's a bit concerning but not immediately life-threatening unless combined with other factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That could indicate family instability or environment issues, which might affect his behavior and mental health as an adult, increasing risk.\n\nBelief in God: This is subjective. Some people have strong faith and others don't. Without more information on how this affects his behavior, it's hard to gauge its impact on risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there are several indicators pointing towards a high-risk profile. Arrest history, lack of education, joblessness, drug use, family living conditions, etc., each contribute to higher chances of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
