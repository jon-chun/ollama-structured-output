    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. His height is 6'1\", weighs 165 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, only one job, has used marijuana in the past four years, felt down recently, lived with his mother in a household of five as a young person in an urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, the multiple arrests and convictions are significant red flags. Recidivism is common among individuals with a history of arrest; each arrest increases the chances of reoffending. That's a strong indicator for high risk.\n\nHis lack of education\u2014no diploma or GED\u2014even though he's 21, suggests he might not have the necessary skills to find stable employment or manage responsibilities effectively. This can contribute to higher risk of involvement in the criminal system again.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly point to high risk unless there are other factors like instability, but since he's never married and has no children, it's unclear if this contributes much here.\n\nUsing marijuana is a drug use; while it's not as severe as harder drugs or alcohol, it can still affect judgment, relationships, and mental health. He also reported feeling down recently, which could indicate underlying mental health issues that might contribute to risk behavior.\n\nHis past living situation with his mother in a household of five suggests he might have experienced neglect or abuse, especially since it was in an urban area where such conditions are more common. This background can lead to behavioral issues and higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nBelieving in God could mean he's seeking support from religion for emotional well-being, which is positive but doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless other factors indicate instability.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests (4+), educational issues, recent drug use, potential mental health struggles, and a negative past living situation. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of reoffending or involvement in the criminal system again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
