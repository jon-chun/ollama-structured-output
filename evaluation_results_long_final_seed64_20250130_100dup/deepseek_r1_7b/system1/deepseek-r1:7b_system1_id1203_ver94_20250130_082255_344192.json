    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions; typically, that could be associated with higher recidivism rates. So that might lean towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't unusual, but his weight is on the lower side at 165 lbs. Not sure if that's directly relevant here unless there's a history of health issues, which I don't see mentioned.\n\nHe's living alone and hasn't been married yet. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or previous family issues, especially since he lived with his mother in a household of five when he was young. That might indicate family challenges which could contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers can lead to substance abuse and other risk behaviors because he may not have the necessary life skills to manage himself effectively.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which is another red flag. Having limited income sources and possibly unstable employment can increase stress and the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years could indicate substance abuse issues, which are known risk factors for recidivism. Plus, feeling down for extended periods might suggest underlying mental health issues or personal struggles that aren't being addressed.\n\nConsidering his religion as a possible influence on his behavior shows he's reflective but doesn't directly point to risk unless there are specific fears or beliefs causing distress.\n\nPutting all these together: prior convictions, living situation with family of five, lack of education, limited employment, substance use, and personal reflections. These factors collectively suggest a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
