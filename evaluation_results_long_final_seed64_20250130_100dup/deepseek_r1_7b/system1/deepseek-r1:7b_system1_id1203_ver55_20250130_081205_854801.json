    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of Black heritage. Age might be on the younger side, but it's also important to consider other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions; four is already high and indicates a history of substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. While this might be relevant for assessing risk in some contexts, it doesn't directly indicate criminal tendencies on its own.\n\nHe's living alone, which could suggest he might face isolation, potentially increasing stress or substance use issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Education gaps often correlate with higher rates of incarceration and substance abuse, so that's a red flag.\n\nHe has only held one job during the year, which can contribute to unemployment strain and increased risk of substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nHis drug use history is limited to marijuana in the past four years, but some recent use during the last month. While not heavy, any drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent.\n\nHe experienced deep lows recently, feeling so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates significant mental health issues, which can increase recidivism risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age suggests a potential for abuse or neglect, which can impact both personal well-being and risk-taking behaviors.\n\nLastly, he acknowledges a relationship with God as part of his belief system, which might influence his personal decisions but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless other factors are present.\n\nConsidering all these points together\u2014multiple prior convictions, lack of education, substance use, isolation, unemployment, mental health issues, and family background\u2014all contribute to high risk. I think the confidence level should be quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
