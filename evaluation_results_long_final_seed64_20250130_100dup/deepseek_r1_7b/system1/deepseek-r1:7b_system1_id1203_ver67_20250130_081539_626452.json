    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. His height is 6'1\", weight 165 lbs, living alone, no HS diploma or GED, only one job in the past year, drug use (marijuana) in the past four years, felt down recently, lived with his mother at age as a household of five in an urban area, and believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, the number of prior arrests and convictions is significant. Four times suggests a history of problematic behavior that might increase risk. His lack of education\u2014no diploma or GED\u2014could mean he's not engaging in higher education or training which might be necessary for stable living situations. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHis recent drug use, especially marijuana, could indicate ongoing substance issues, which are known to affect mental health and decision-making. Feeling down a lot lately suggests possible depression or emotional instability, both of which can influence risk behavior.\n\nLiving in a household of five might have social factors that contribute to his risk profile\u2014small households often face more stressors like financial strain or neglect. Believing in God could be a protective factor against some forms of abuse or neglect if he's aware and deals with it religiously, but I'm not sure how strong this is.\n\nConsidering all these points: prior convictions (which are a red flag), lack of education, recent drug use, emotional state, living situation, and personal belief. These factors together suggest a high risk. The confidence level should be high because the number of prior arrests is notable, along with other concerning indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
