    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who is a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and convictions. His height is 6'1\", single, no diploma or GED, currently living alone. He's employed one job in the past year, used marijuana before but not recently, and had some low mood feelings over the past month.\n\nFirst, the number of prior arrests and convictions is significant\u2014four times. That indicates a history of substance abuse because he's been in legal trouble multiple times. Substance use can have serious consequences on someone's ability to function and maintain relationships, which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's living alone, which could isolate him and increase stress or feelings of being abandoned, especially considering his young age and past living with five family members. Living alone might make him more vulnerable to negative influences or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED, which can limit opportunities and contribute to unstable situations. Being out of school might affect his motivation and ability to seek help or support.\n\nHis current job is only one in the past year; that could mean he's not stable economically or socially. Unemployment often leads to higher risk behaviors like substance use to cope with stress.\n\nHe used marijuana before, which can lead to other drug issues if not monitored. He also felt down and didn't feel able to get out of bed for a while, suggesting possible depression symptoms. If he's struggling with mood issues, it might affect his ability to function in daily life or maintain relationships.\n\nHis early life involved living with five family members in an urban area. Growing up in such an environment can have both positive and negative aspects. However, it also means he may not have had a stable or nurturing environment, which could contribute to behavioral issues later on.\n\nHe believes in God's influence over his life, which is a positive factor as spirituality can provide support and reduce stress. But if his substance use is causing problems, his spiritual reliance might not be enough to overcome it.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests indicate past instability or problem areas like substance abuse. His living situation could contribute to emotional strain or isolation. His lack of education and single status may affect his ability to find better opportunities. Substance use and possible mood issues further complicate his stability. While some factors are mitigated by his belief in God, the overall risk is high due to prior criminal history and other contributing factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
