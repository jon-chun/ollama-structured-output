    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this risk factor step by step. \n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, which doesn't immediately indicate high risk but could be relevant considering racial disparities in certain systems.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's significant because multiple convictions can impact an individual's risk level, especially if they're repeat offenders or have violent history.\n\nHis physical attributes\u20146'1\" and 165 lbs\u2014are within a typical range for his age but don't directly point to risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe lives alone, which might suggest he doesn't have strong support networks. Living alone can be isolating and may increase stress or substance use as mentioned.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so this could indicate higher risk.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which might mean he has inconsistent income sources. Unstable employment can contribute to financial stress and substance abuse.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned other substances. Since he feels down often, it's possible he might be using other substances now or experiencing mental health issues.\n\nHis background: At a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could indicate family dysfunction or exposure to trauma, which can affect behavior and risk.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a positive factor but doesn't negate risk factors related to substance abuse or prior convictions.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple factors like past convictions, lack of education, living alone, and drug use suggest he's at high risk. I'll set the confidence level quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
