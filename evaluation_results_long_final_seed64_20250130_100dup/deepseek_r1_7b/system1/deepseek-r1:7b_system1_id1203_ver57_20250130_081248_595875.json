    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this risk assessment case and trying to determine if the person is high risk. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age 21 might indicate he's still developing, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in certain areas, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's already a significant number of convictions, so that points towards a history of problematic behavior.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. I don't think these directly contribute to risk unless there's something about his past that ties into his weight or height, but nothing stands out here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, so no support system which might indicate lower risk if he has family for help, but it could also mean he relies on himself more, potentially leading to higher risk factors like substance abuse.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college. This is concerning because education can contribute to both positive outcomes and continued problematic behavior if not supported.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Unemployment for so long could mean he's struggling economically, which might lead him to turn to substance use or other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana over four years. Drug abuse is a major risk factor and can lead to further instability in personal life, affecting relationships and job prospects.\n\nHe felt down for much of the past month without any positive triggers. This could indicate depression or another mental health issue, both of which are significant risks that need attention.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. High family size can lead to neglect issues and potentially abuse, which is concerning for a risk assessment.\n\nLastly, he believes God has some role in his life. While spirituality can be protective against certain risks, if there's no support network, it might not help much, especially given previous risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and living alone without a strong support system. These factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
