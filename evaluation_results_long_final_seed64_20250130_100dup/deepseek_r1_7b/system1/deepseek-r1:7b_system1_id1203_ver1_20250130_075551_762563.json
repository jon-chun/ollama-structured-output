    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male with four arrests and a conviction. That seems like a lot of previous convictions; that could be a strong indicator of high risk because prior involvement in the system often leads to more criminal behavior now.\n\nHis physical description is next\u2014he's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I'm not sure if height or weight alone are significant here, but it doesn't immediately raise red flags either way.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which might mean he's an adult child living away from home. This could be a sign of instability, possibly leading to higher risk behavior.\n\nNot having a high school diploma and not going to college is concerning because educational attainment can correlate with lower recidivism rates if someone has the necessary skills or support. Not completing basic education might increase his chances of engaging in further criminal activities.\n\nHe's employed only one job during the year, which could mean he's struggling financially. Economic hardship often leads people towards risky choices to survive.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt low for part of the month. Drug use can have immediate effects on mood and decision-making, which might contribute to risk behaviors like substance abuse or impulsive actions.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a crowded living situation, which could lead to stress, neglect, or other issues that might increase risk.\n\nFinally, he believes in God and thinks it affects his personal life. This belief can be protective against some types of risk behavior but doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are other factors pointing towards criminal activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together\u2014multiple arrests, lack of education, living situation, drug use\u2014the likelihood is quite high that this person poses a significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
