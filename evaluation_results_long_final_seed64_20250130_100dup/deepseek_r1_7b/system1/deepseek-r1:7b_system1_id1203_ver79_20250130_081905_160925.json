Unmarried and living alone, which might indicate some instability.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Only one job in the past year could mean limited opportunities or maybe not much responsibility. Drug use from the past four years shows he's been struggling with substance abuse, especially recently when he felt really down.\n\nLiving in a household of five at a young age with his biological mother suggests he might have experienced a lot of stress or neglect. His belief in God could be a positive motivator but also might show limited coping mechanisms if that support isn't enough.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, his history of criminal behavior, lack of education, unstable living situation, and substance abuse all point towards him being at high risk. His recent feelings of low mood due to drugs add to the severity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
