    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male Black individual who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Black, which can be an indicator of higher crime rates in some areas but it's not the only factor here. Age-wise, he's young at 21, so maybe less experience, but multiple arrests indicate past issues.\n\nHe uses marijuana and has feelings of low mood recently. Drug use and emotional distress are red flags for substance abuse, which can lead to more risk behaviors or instability.\n\nMarital status: He's never married and living alone. Living with family at a young age (household size 5) might provide support, but it could also mean he relies on others too much. His lack of education\u2014he doesn't have a diploma or is in college\u2014might affect his stability and ability to contribute.\n\nOnly one job shows some work history, which can be positive if stable, but maybe limited opportunities for upward mobility. Emotional distress and recent low mood could indicate underlying issues that might affect his behavior or self-esteem.\n\nConsidering the prior convictions, especially at such a young age, this suggests he's had significant trouble fitting in or managing his life. His current living situation alone without support might increase stress or isolation, which can be risky.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education and skills, drug use, emotional issues, and living alone without family support. These factors point towards a high risk of engaging in risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
