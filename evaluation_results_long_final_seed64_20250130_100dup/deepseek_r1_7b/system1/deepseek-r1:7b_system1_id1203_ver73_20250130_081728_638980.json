    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being young might actually reduce immediate risk since he's still developing and has fewer life experiences that could contribute to criminal behavior. However, race can be a significant factor in predictive analytics because it's linked to systemic issues affecting his opportunities and outcomes.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and convicted. That's a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which is a strong risk factor. Repeated convictions usually predict higher future risk for reoffending or causing harm.\n\nHis height and weight (6 feet 1 inch, 165 lbs) don't seem directly relevant to the risk assessment unless there are specific health concerns, but nothing in the provided factors points to that.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone. Living arrangements can influence support systems; being single might mean he relies more on himself for decisions and support, which could increase risk if he makes impulsive or harmful choices.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when higher education is available as a stepping stone. Not having this qualification might indicate limited opportunities that could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which suggests potential instability. Job loss can lead to financial stress and increased risk of engaging in harmful activities like drug use or illegal behavior.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) for four years is concerning but not life-threatening yet. However, even moderate drug use can impair judgment, affect relationships, and contribute to negative moods which he expresses by feeling down and unmotivated.\n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area points to potential family issues or environment stress. Younger siblings might mean he's part of a larger family where there could be more supervision or less involvement that supports risky behavior.\n\nBelieving in God (God has something to do with his personal events) suggests he may seek moral guidance, which could sometimes indicate responsible behavior but also highlights possible areas of vulnerability if there's a lack of support for those beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest and conviction records, low educational status, single living situation, and history of drug use are significant red flags. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of future criminal behavior or harm to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
