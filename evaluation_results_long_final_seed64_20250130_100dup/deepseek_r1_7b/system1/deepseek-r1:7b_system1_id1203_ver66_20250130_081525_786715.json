    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, 21 years old. The race doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but that's not provided here.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Recidivism is definitely a red flag; multiple arrests increase the chances of future criminal behavior.\n\nAt 6'1\" and weighing 165 lbs, he falls into a weight category that might present health risks like hypertension or obesity, but without health issues mentioned, I can't confirm this as a risk factor here.\n\nLiving alone is common among many groups and doesn't inherently make someone a risk. No high school diploma or GED could impact his employability or ability to contribute financially, but again, not directly tied to risk unless it leads to poverty, which isn't specified.\n\nHe held only one job during the year; part-time work can be sustainable, so this might not be a significant issue.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood suggests possible substance abuse or mental health issues. This could affect his ability to manage daily life and may increase risk behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five means he's part of a larger family, which might offer emotional support but doesn't inherently correlate with high risk unless there are issues within the family that aren't mentioned.\n\nHis religious belief in God might indicate a stable upbringing or personal values, but without specific issues, it's hard to tie this directly to risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, multiple arrests and possible substance use seem like the strongest indicators of a high risk. Recidivism rates for individuals with prior convictions are significantly higher. The drug use and potential mood issues also contribute to risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
