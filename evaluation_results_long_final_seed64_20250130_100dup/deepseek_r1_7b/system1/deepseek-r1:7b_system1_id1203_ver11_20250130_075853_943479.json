    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk and respond with a JSON object. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 21 years old. Generally, younger individuals might have more energy and less life experience, which could influence risk behavior. However, this alone isn't a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nRace: He identifies as Black. While race can be a factor in certain risk assessments due to historical data on crime rates, it's important not to make assumptions without context or specific data. Without more information, I'll tentatively consider it moderate.\n\nNumber of arrests and convictions: He has been arrested 4 times and convicted once. Repeated arrest is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior, which can predict future criminal tendencies. This is a strong risk factor.\n\nPhysical attributes: Standing at 6 feet 1 inch and weighing 165 lbs don't raise immediate red flags regarding physical risk but could be relevant in certain contexts like job type or living situation, which he's currently living alone. Not sure how much this contributes to risk here.\n\nMarital status and living situation: He is unmarried and living alone. Living independently can sometimes correlate with higher responsibility levels, but it also depends on the individual's context and support network.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with lower income, higher unemployment rates, and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug use or criminal activity.\n\nOccupation history: He has held only one job during the year. Job instability is associated with higher levels of stress, substance abuse, and potential for criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt down for part of the month. Substance abuse, especially alcohol or other drugs, is a known risk factor linked to criminal behavior, legal issues, and health problems.\n\nEarly life circumstances: Living with his biological mother at age 5 in an urban area with five people could indicate exposure to potential stressors like substance abuse, neglect, or crime ridden environments, which can contribute to higher risk of negative outcomes later in life. Additionally, his belief in God might mitigate some risk factors if it leads to positive coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting all this together: The key indicators are the multiple arrests (4 times), lack of education, and drug use. These points suggest a moderate to high risk. Considering that he's 21, perhaps still developing, but with past criminal history, these could indicate higher risk despite being relatively young.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
