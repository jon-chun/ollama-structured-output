    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age-wise, he's quite young, which might not be directly linked to risk but could be a consideration in other contexts. His criminal history includes four arrests and one conviction\u2014this seems significant because multiple convictions often correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe stands at 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue there, though weight can sometimes indicate underlying health issues which might not be directly related to the risk assessment but could be a factor in other areas.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and hasn't studied much\u2014no high school diploma or GED. This suggests he might have struggled with education or family support, both of which are known predictors of recidivism. Not being enrolled in college also points towards instability or lack of motivation.\n\nHe has a job history of one during the year\u2014it's possible but might indicate recent arrest and thus temporary employment gaps due to incarceration or similar situations.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is generally not severe compared to other drugs. However, some use within the last month could be concerning if it's frequent or recent. The mention of feeling down for much of the time might suggest underlying mental health issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of five in an urban area\u2014this could indicate exposure to family dynamics and social environment that might influence his behavior and risk factors.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has a strong spiritual support system, which can be positive but also might imply limited other support networks if that's the primary source of help.\n\nPutting it all together: His multiple arrests and convictions are red flags. His lack of education and living situation could contribute to lower self-esteem or instability. The recent drug use is concerning, especially in the past month. However, his age makes him more susceptible to developing new habits. The positive spiritual aspect might provide some protective factors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards high risk because of the significant criminal history, possible underlying mental health issues from drug use and living situation, but not certain extremes. So confidence is around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
