    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate high risk. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, but race doesn't directly influence risk unless there are systemic issues involved, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each arrest increases the risk of reoffending.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6'1\" and 165 lbs don't raise immediate red flags but might be relevant if combined with other factors like weight management, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support networks, which are crucial for stability and reintegration after incarceration.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and skills.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, indicating possible underemployment or lack of steady income, which can strain financial stability.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for reoffending, especially if it's chronic.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood and depression are concerning. Depression without treatment is a strong indicator of potential risky behavior or self-harm.\n\nHe was raised in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. Parenting challenges can affect his ability to form stable relationships later on.\n\nLastly, he mentions believing in God's influence over his life. While religious factors are personal and not directly linked to risk, they can sometimes correlate with responsible behavior if adhered to, but it's not a clear indicator of high risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (4), lack of education, unstable living situation, substance abuse, recent low mood, and possible parenting issues. These factors point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
