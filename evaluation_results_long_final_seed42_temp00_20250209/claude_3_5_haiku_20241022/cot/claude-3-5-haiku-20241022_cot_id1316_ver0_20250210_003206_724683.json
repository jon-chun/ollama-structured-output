He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area.
