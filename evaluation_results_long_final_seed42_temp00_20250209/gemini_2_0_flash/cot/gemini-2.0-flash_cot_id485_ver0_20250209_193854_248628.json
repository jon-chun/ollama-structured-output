He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
