He has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
