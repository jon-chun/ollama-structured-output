He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 255 lbs. He is married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his adoptive parent(s) in a household of size 6, in a rural area.
