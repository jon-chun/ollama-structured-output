She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 214 lbs. She is separated and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 9.
