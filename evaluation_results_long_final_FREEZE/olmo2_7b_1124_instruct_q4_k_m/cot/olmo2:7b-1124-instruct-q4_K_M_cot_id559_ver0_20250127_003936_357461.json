Younger individuals often have less life experience and are more prone to engaging in risky behaviors which can lead to recidivism.\n* **Number_of_arrests:** High. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, suggesting a higher risk of reoffending within three years.\n* **Gender:** Medium. Males generally have a higher recidivism rate compared to females.\n* **Race:** Low. In this context, race does not significantly impact three-year rearrest rates.\n* **Marital_Status:** Medium. Being unmarried can indicate fewer social supports and potentially more isolation, which might increase the risk of reoffending.\n* **Education_Level:** Low. A high school diploma compared to a college degree is associated with higher rates of recidivism.\n* **Employment_History:** Medium. Gaps in employment or holding multiple jobs could signal instability, which may increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n* **Drug_Use:** Medium. Past drug use raises risk, but recent use indicates ongoing involvement with high-risk environments and associates.\n* **Past_Mood_State:** Medium. Feeling persistently down could be indicative of underlying mental health issues affecting behavioral choices and increasing the risk of reoffending.\n* **Household_Size_Young:** Low. Growing up in a larger household typically has positive socialization effects, which generally reduce the risk of recidivism.\n\n**Prediction & Confidence:**\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75%. This suggests that there is a moderate to high likelihood of this individual reoffending within the next three years based on the identified risk factors.",
