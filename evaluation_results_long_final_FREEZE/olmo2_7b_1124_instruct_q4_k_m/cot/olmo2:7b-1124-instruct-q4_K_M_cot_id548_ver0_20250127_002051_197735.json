However, no information on current relationship status.\n* **Residence:** Medium risk; living alone could increase risk if there's no supportive network, but school enrollment suggests structure and support.\n* **Employment History:** Low risk; holding jobs indicates responsibility, mitigating potential recidivism risk.\n* **Drug Use:** High risk; any drug use, especially multiple substances, increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n* **Depressive Symptoms:** Medium risk; depressive symptoms could affect judgment and increase propensity for criminal behavior if not addressed.\n* **Early Family Environment:** Medium risk; growing up in a single-father household in an urban area presents potential exposure to certain risks but also might have a protective effect due to parental figure present.\n* **Religious Belief:** Low risk; belief in God can sometimes provide a moral framework that may decrease recidivism risk.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:** The overall prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 70%. This reflects a balanced assessment of the risks and protective factors, with drug use and depressive symptoms standing out as higher risks, while educational engagement and employment history offer some mitigation.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
