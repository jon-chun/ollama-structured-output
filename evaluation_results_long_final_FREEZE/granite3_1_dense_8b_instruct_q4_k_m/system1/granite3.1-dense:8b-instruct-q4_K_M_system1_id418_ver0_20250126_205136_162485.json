Age (20-year-old) and gender (male) are not typically associated with high recidivism rates.\n2. One arrest without conviction is a lesser indicator of risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\n3. Physical attributes such as height and weight do not significantly contribute to criminal behavior predictions.\n4. Marital status and living arrangements are generally not strong predictors of recidivism.\n5. Educational attainment (high school diploma) and employment history (held 1 job) suggest some level of stability.\n6. Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a risk factor, but the absence of depression symptoms over the past month reduces this concern.\n7. Growing up in a large household may increase resilience or adaptability.\n8. Belief in a higher power can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is moderate due to the presence of drug use and the single arrest. These factors introduce some uncertainty into the prediction.",
