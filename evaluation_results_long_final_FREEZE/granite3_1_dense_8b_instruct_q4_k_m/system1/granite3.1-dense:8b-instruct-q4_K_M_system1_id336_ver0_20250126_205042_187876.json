The individual's age (19), gender, and ethnicity are not predictive of criminal behavior on their own. His arrest history is limited to one instance without conviction, which is a lower-risk factor. Living alone, being unmarried, and having a high school diploma also do not significantly increase risk. Holding multiple jobs indicates stability. Past drug use (marijuana) while concerning, does not necessarily indicate high recidivism risk. The absence of depression symptoms in the past month is positive. His upbringing in an urban area with his biological mother and siblings suggests a family structure which can provide support. Belief in a higher power can also be associated with lower risk. Therefore, based on these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 60%.",
