    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n1. Age and gender: At 22 years old, the individual is young and female, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Prior arrests and convictions: Although she has been arrested once, there is no indication of a prior conviction, which suggests that she may not pose a significant risk for reoffending.\n3. Education: She holds a Bachelor's degree, indicating a higher level of education, which tends to be associated with lower recidivism rates.\n4. Employment history: Holding 4 jobs in the past year could indicate instability but also suggests an active search for employment, which is generally a positive factor.\n5. Drug use: While she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), her current use patterns are not explicitly stated as problematic or chronic. The occasional use of marijuana and cocaine may not be indicative of a high risk for reoffending.\n6. Mental health: Although she reported feeling down during the past month, there is no indication of ongoing mental health issues that could significantly impact her behavior or increase her risk level.\n7. Family history: Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents and siblings does not suggest a high-risk environment.\n8. Religious beliefs: Not having a strong religious belief may not directly contribute to criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\n\nHowever, some factors like drug use, feelings of depression, and job instability could potentially indicate higher risk if they were more pronounced or chronic in nature. Given the information provided, it is reasonable to predict a relatively low risk level for reoffending, but with a moderate level of uncertainty due to the limited scope of available data.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
