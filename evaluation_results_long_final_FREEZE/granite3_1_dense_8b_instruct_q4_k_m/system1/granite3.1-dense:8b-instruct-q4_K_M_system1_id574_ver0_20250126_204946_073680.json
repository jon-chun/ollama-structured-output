The individual is young, has no prior convictions, and is enrolled in college, suggesting potential for positive life changes. Her drug use, while present, does not suggest a pattern of addiction as she has not felt depressed recently. She lives alone and has never been married, which can indicate a level of self-sufficiency and stability. The urban upbringing in a small household could potentially contribute to higher risk, but her current endeavors (college enrollment) offset this factor. Her religious belief may also contribute to a sense of personal responsibility and accountability. However, without more specific information about the nature and context of her arrests or drug use, it's challenging to definitively classify her as high risk. Therefore, the prediction is made with moderate confidence.",
