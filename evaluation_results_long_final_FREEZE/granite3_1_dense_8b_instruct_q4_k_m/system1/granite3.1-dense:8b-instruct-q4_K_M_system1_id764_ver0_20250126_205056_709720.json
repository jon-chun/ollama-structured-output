The individual is of young age, has had only one arrest and conviction, and is currently enrolled in school, which suggests potential for rehabilitation and low recidivism risk. Living alone indicates a degree of independence and self-reliance. His physical attributes do not suggest any inherent risks. The fact that he has never been married does not contribute significantly to the risk assessment. His drug use is concerning, but it's limited to marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. There's no indication of recent substance abuse or addiction problems. He has not felt depressed recently, which suggests a stable mental state. Living in an urban area with his biological mother at a young age could potentially indicate some level of instability, but this is mitigated by the fact that he's now living alone and enrolled in school. His lack of religiosity does not directly correlate to criminal behavior. The low confidence score reflects the limited information provided and the generalized nature of the assessment.",
