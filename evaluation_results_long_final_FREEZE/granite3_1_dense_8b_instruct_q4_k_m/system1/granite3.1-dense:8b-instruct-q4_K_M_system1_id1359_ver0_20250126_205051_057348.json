    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons:\n1. Age (19 years old) and gender (male) are not typically associated with high recidivism rates.\n2. Two arrests without a history of violent offenses suggests a lower risk profile.\n3. Current enrollment in school indicates stability and a commitment to personal growth, which can be a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n4. The absence of job history does not necessarily imply an increased risk, as it could be due to various factors such as educational pursuits or temporary setbacks.\n5. Past drug use (marijuana) is less concerning than harder substances and does not automatically indicate high risk.\n6. Absence of depression over the past month suggests emotional stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\n7. Growing up in a household with five siblings might promote social skills and resilience.\n8. Living alone indicates self-sufficiency and independence.\n9. Religious belief may provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n10. Urban upbringing does not inherently imply high risk.\n\nDespite some factors that could potentially increase risk (e.g., prior arrests and drug use), the combination of these factors overall suggests a moderate to low recidivism risk. The confidence level is 60% due to the limited information provided about the nature of the offenses, substance abuse history, and other potential risk factors not mentioned in the prompt.",
