Firstly, the individual is young (19 years old) and has only been arrested once with no prior convictions, indicating a limited criminal history. She has not used drugs in the past four years, which suggests a lower propensity towards crimes related to substance abuse. While she feels depressed at times, there is no history of mental health treatment or diagnosis. Her living situation (alone) and marital status (never married) do not suggest a higher risk for criminal behavior. She has held only one job in the past year, which could be indicative of challenges but does not necessarily predict future criminal behavior. The size of her household at a young age suggests she may have experienced some adversity, but this alone is not a strong predictor of future risk. Her religious beliefs also do not typically correlate with higher risk for criminal activity. However, it's important to note that confidence in this prediction is low due to the limited information provided.",
