The individual is young (20 years old), which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates. They have only been arrested and convicted once, suggesting limited criminal history. The individual's physical health indicators are average, with no history of drug use or depression. They have maintained employment and live independently, indicating stability. While living in a single-parent household at a young age can sometimes be associated with higher risk, the individual's current stable lifestyle suggests otherwise. Lastly, their strong religious beliefs may act as a protective factor against criminal behavior. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based solely on the provided factors and does not account for potential unmentioned variables or contextual information.",
