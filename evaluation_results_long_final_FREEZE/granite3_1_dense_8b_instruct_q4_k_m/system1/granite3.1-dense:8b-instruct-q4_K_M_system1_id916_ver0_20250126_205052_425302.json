While the individual has used drugs and has a history of arrest, these factors are mitigated by his young age, lack of prior convictions, educational attainment, employment history, and absence of depression or suicidal ideation. The fact that he lives with others rather than alone may also suggest some level of social support, which can be protective against criminal behavior. However, the confidence in this prediction is relatively low due to the limited information provided.",
