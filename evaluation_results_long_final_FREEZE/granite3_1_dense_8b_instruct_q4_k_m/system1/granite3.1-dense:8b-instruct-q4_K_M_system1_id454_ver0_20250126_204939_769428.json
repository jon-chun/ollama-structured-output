She has had limited arrests and convictions, held only one job in the past year, and has not reported feeling depressed recently. Her drug use, while present, was limited to marijuana. The absence of a history of marriage or living in a household with biological parents, along with her current independent living situation, could indicate some resilience. However, the relatively low number of risk factors and their severity suggest that this individual is not at high risk for recidivism. The confidence level is moderate due to the limited information provided about her criminal history and behavioral patterns.",
