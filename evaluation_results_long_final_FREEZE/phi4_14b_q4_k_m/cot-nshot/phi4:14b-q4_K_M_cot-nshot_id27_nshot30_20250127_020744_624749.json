However, any arrest can be indicative of potential risk factors.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Possession of a GED certificate indicates educational attainment above those who have no diploma or GED, potentially lowering recidivism risk slightly compared to lower educational levels.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some level of stability and responsibility, which can be protective against recidivism but also indicates possible instability if the employment was not long-term or stable.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"The use of both marijuana and cocaine is a strong risk factor for recidivism due to the association with criminal behavior and potential legal issues related to substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Reporting feeling 'so down in the dumps' all the time indicates severe depression, which can increase vulnerability to engaging in behaviors that lead to rearrest if not properly managed or treated.\"),\n    (\"household background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a household of four suggests some level of familial stability during childhood, though this factor is less predictive of future outcomes without additional context.\"),\n    (\"religious/spiritual beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God influences life events could be protective if it leads to positive behaviors and community engagement, but its impact on recidivism can vary widely depending on other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Age**: At 21, this individual is in a critical age range where risk for recidivism might be elevated due to potential ongoing development and life transitions.\n\n2. **Gender**: While gender can influence recidivism rates, with females generally having lower rates, it's not heavily weighted here because the examples show mixed outcomes regardless of gender.\n\n3. **Arrest History**: A single arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is not as significant a predictor as multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n4. **Education**: Having a GED provides more educational stability than no diploma or high school dropout, which can be protective against recidivism.\n\n5. **Employment History**: Holding two jobs might suggest some responsibility and ability to work, but frequent job changes could indicate instability.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: The use of both marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor due to the potential for legal issues and continued engagement in criminal activities related to drug use.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Severe depression reported consistently over the past month is a critical factor, as it can lead to behaviors that increase the likelihood of rearrest if not addressed.\n\n8. **Household Background**: A stable childhood household might provide some protective effects but doesn't strongly predict future behavior in isolation.\n\n9. **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs**: This factor's impact is mixed; while potentially providing a support network, it depends on how these beliefs translate into actions and community involvement.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within three years is based on the high risk associated with drug use and mental health issues, combined with moderate risks from employment instability and arrest history. The confidence level reflects the strong influence of drug use and mental health while acknowledging that other factors might mitigate or exacerbate these risks.",
