Female offenders typically have a lower recidivism rate than males.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** The person has been arrested once but not convicted. A lack of convictions suggests that there hasn't been sufficient evidence or behavior leading to further legal issues, indicating a lower risk.\n\n3. **Living Situation and Education:** She is currently enrolled in a graduate program, demonstrating ambition and engagement in education, which are positive indicators for stability and future planning. However, she is not living alone, which might reduce personal responsibility but also provides support from others.\n\n4. **Employment History:** Holding three jobs in the past year shows employment instability, which can be a risk factor, though it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own without additional negative factors.\n\n5. **Substance Use:** Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) within the last four years is concerning but not definitive for predicting future criminal behavior. The absence of recent depression symptoms suggests better mental health stability recently.\n\n6. **Family Background and Beliefs:** Growing up in a stable, albeit large household with biological parents can be seen as positive. Her belief that God influences her life might provide a moral framework that discourages criminal activity.\n\nGiven these factors, while there are some concerns (such as drug use and employment instability), the overall profile suggests a moderate to low risk of reoffending. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of both positive and negative indicators but leaning towards lower risk based on current information.",
