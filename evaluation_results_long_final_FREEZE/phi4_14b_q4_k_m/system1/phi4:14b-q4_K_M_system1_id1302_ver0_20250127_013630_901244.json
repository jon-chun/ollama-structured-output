Economic instability can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, especially recent use, is a strong predictor of future risky behaviors or offenses.\n\n5. **Mental Health Concerns:** The report of feeling \"down in the dumps\" suggests potential mental health issues such as depression, which can be associated with higher risk levels if not properly managed.\n\n6. **Social Support and Beliefs:** Living alone without a supportive network may contribute to increased vulnerability. However, religious beliefs might provide some protective factors, though they are less quantifiable in this context.\n\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects the presence of multiple significant risk factors but acknowledges that individual circumstances can vary widely, and not all factors are equally predictive for every person.",
