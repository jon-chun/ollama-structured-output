    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe analysis of risk factors for predicting high risk involves evaluating various elements such as criminal history, social and economic status, substance use, mental health, family background, and personal beliefs. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Criminal History:** The individual has been arrested three times and convicted at least once, which is a significant risk factor for future offenses.\n\n2. **Demographic Factors:** Being a young male (22 years old) can statistically correlate with higher risk levels in criminal behavior compared to other demographics.\n\n3. **Social Stability:** He has never been married and is not living alone, suggesting potential instability or lack of strong personal support systems.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Holding only one job during the year might indicate economic instability. Although he holds a high school diploma, not being enrolled in college could limit future employment opportunities.\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators; however, these do not significantly mitigate other risk factors present.\n\n6. **Family Background:** Having lived with only his biological mother at a young age might suggest limited family support or structure during formative years.\n\n7. **Beliefs and Attitudes:** His belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally may indicate a lack of spiritual or moral guidance, which some studies correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nOverall, the presence of multiple risk factors, particularly in criminal history and social stability, leads to a prediction of \"YES\" for high risk. However, there are also mitigating factors such as no recent substance use or depression, leading to moderate confidence (65) in this assessment.",
