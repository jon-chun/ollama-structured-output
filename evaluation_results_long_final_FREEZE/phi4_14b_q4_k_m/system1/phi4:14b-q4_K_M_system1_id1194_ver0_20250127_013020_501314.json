Being Black may correlate with systemic biases in some contexts, but without additional discriminatory factors, it does not inherently indicate high risk.\n  \n- **Criminal History**: A single arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\n- **Social and Personal Factors**: Living alone and lacking a high school diploma or GED can be indicators of social instability. However, holding two jobs in a year shows some level of responsibility and economic activity.\n\n- **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No recent drug use and no depression are positive indicators for risk assessment.\n\n- **Upbringing and Beliefs**: Growing up in an urban household with a strong belief in personal agency through faith may provide social support, though the impact varies individually.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could increase risk (e.g., lack of education, single arrest), the individual's positive aspects (employment, no recent drug use or depression) suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to these mixed indicators and inherent uncertainties in predicting future behavior based on past data.",
