While males are statistically more likely to engage in risky behavior, his age and being married may counterbalance this factor slightly.\n\n2. **Criminal Record**: He has been arrested once but not convicted. This indicates some contact with law enforcement but does not strongly suggest a high risk of future criminal activity without further context or convictions.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: His height and weight are within normal ranges, which do not contribute significantly to risk assessment.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being married and living with his spouse can be stabilizing factors, reducing the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate is a potential risk factor for socio-economic challenges, but holding two jobs indicates some level of stability and responsibility.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators regarding substance abuse and mental health stability.\n\n7. **Family Background**: Growing up in a rural area with his biological mother in a small household does not inherently indicate high risk, especially without additional negative factors such as domestic issues or exposure to crime.\n\n8. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God plays a role in personal life may suggest a moral framework and support system, which can be protective against engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., lack of education), the positive indicators (e.g., employment stability, absence of drug use) contribute to a lower overall risk assessment. The confidence level is set at 85 due to the presence of both mitigating and potential risk factors but leaning towards a more stable lifestyle.",
