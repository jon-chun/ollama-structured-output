However, this alone does not indicate high risk without additional negative factors.\n\n2. **Race and Demographics**: Identifying as White does not inherently increase or decrease risk based on statistical data. \n\n3. **Arrest Record**: Having been arrested twice but not convicted suggests a history of encounters with law enforcement, which could be concerning. However, the lack of convictions implies that these incidents may not have resulted in legal findings of wrongdoing.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes**: Height and weight are not direct indicators of risk unless correlated with other factors such as physical aggression or involvement in certain types of crime.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone does not inherently increase risk, though it might suggest a lack of stable support systems.\n\n6. **Education and Employment**: Having completed high school and held one job suggests some level of stability, although holding only one job in the past year may indicate potential instability or underemployment.\n\n7. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators, suggesting lower risk related to substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\n8. **Family Background**: Growing up with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area is generally considered stable, though urban environments can have higher exposure to crime.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Considering that God has something to do with personal events may indicate a moral framework or belief system, which could be protective against criminal behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile there are some risk factors present (e.g., arrest record), the individual also exhibits several protective factors (e.g., no drug use, stable family background). The balance of these factors suggests a moderate to low overall risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" for high risk with a confidence level of 75%, acknowledging that while there are some concerns, they do not overwhelmingly indicate a high risk.",
