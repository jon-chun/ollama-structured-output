However, this factor alone does not indicate high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Criminal History**: The individual has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests some involvement with the legal system but does not necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n- **Employment and Education**: Holding two jobs during the year and being enrolled in college are positive indicators. They suggest stability and a commitment to personal development, reducing risk.\n\n- **Drug Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine is concerning, as substance abuse can be linked to higher recidivism rates. However, there is no indication of current drug use or dependency issues.\n\n- **Mental Health**: The individual has not felt depressed in the past month, which suggests stable mental health at present.\n\n- **Family Background**: Growing up with both biological parents and in a household of size 4 is generally considered a positive factor for stability.\n\n- **Religious Belief**: Considering that God plays a role in personal life can be associated with lower risk due to potential moral guidance and community support.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (young age, drug use history), the individual's employment status, educational pursuits, and stable family background during upbringing suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75, reflecting moderate certainty based on these mixed indicators.",
