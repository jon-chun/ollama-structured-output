However, being female slightly reduces risk compared to males.\n\n- **Criminal History:** Two arrests without convictions suggest some interaction with the criminal justice system but not necessarily high risk. The absence of convictions is mitigating.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Being enrolled in college and having held two jobs are positive factors that generally correlate with lower recidivism risk.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) raises concern, as substance abuse can be a significant factor in criminal behavior. The recent feeling of depression could exacerbate this risk if it leads to continued or increased substance use.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Expressing feelings of being \"down in the dumps\" suggests potential mental health issues, which are important risk factors for recidivism if untreated.\n\n- **Social and Religious Beliefs:** Living alone and having no strong religious affiliation might indicate a lack of social support, which is crucial for reducing recidivism. However, these factors are less directly predictive than others.\n\nGiven the combination of substance use, mental health concerns, and some criminal history, there is a moderate to high risk indicated, though not definitive without further information on current behavior or interventions in place. The confidence level reflects this uncertainty.",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
