Additionally, no recent depression indicates good mental health recently.\n- **Living Situation**: Living alone may indicate independence; however, it might also suggest a lack of social support, which can be a risk factor if not managed well.\n- **Family Background and Beliefs**: Growing up in a non-traditional household and having spiritual beliefs could provide resilience or coping mechanisms.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a moderate to low risk for re-offending, although some areas such as substance use history and living situation should be monitored. The confidence level is set at 70 due to the relatively limited information on current behavior patterns and social support networks.",
