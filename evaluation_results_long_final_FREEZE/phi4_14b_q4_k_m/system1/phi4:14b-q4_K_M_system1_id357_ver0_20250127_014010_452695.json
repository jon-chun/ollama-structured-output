However, his belief that God does not influence personal events might suggest a lack of spiritual or moral guidance for some individuals, though this is subjective.\n\nOverall, while many factors do not indicate high risk alone, the combination of young age, criminal history, and social/economic instability suggests a moderate to high risk level. Confidence is set at 65 due to the presence of multiple risk factors but also considering mitigating aspects like no recent depression or ongoing drug use.",
