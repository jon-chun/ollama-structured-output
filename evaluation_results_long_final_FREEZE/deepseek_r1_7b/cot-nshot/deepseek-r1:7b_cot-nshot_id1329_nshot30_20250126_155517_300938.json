    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male with a criminal history of 2 arrests and a conviction. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's definitely high weight.\n\nHis weight is 130 lbs, which is quite low. Obesity has been shown to increase the risk of recidivism, so I'll assign medium weight here because while it's a contributing factor, it might not be as impactful as other factors in this case.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but since he's an 18-year-old with no ties, that's more of a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which is a red flag for employment and self-sufficiency, so another medium weight factor.\n\nNot enrolled in college suggests instability, which could be low to medium depending on the situation. Since he's 18 but not in school, maybe it's lower than if he were in full-time education.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year; having work experience is generally positive for recidivism, so that might actually reduce risk, perhaps a low weight.\n\nDrug use: only marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse can have significant psychological effects and may contribute to negative emotions, but since it's just marijuana and not hard drugs, maybe the impact is lower than if it were harder drugs or more recent use. So medium weight.\n\nHe felt down for some of the past month; this could indicate underlying mental health issues which might increase risk. So that's another high factor.\n\nAt 18 years old, living with both biological parents in a household size of 9 in an urban area. Urban areas can offer more resources and support but also higher stress due to community dynamics. Household size may provide stability or strain, so I'm leaning towards medium weight here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal issues; this is a strong positive indicator as religious affiliation can contribute to self-regulation and personal responsibility.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the highest risk, followed by no education. Drug use and feeling down also add to the risk, but other factors like being in an urban area might mitigate some of that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions significantly increase recidivism rates as they indicate past behavior issues that can predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"low Education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and contribute to instability, which is moderately concerning but not the highest risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana alone might indicate potential substance abuse issues that can impact mental health and behavior, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for a month could signal underlying mental health issues or dissatisfaction, which are serious factors in predicting recidivism\"),\n    (\"Urban Living with Biological Parents\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with multiple household members might offer more support but could also have stressors that may not directly correlate to higher risk without other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at 18\", \"low\", \"At this age, living alone is common and does not inherently indicate high risk compared to other factors like prior convictions or education issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
