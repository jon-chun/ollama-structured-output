    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this person based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person has a lot of arrest history\u201422 times\u2014and he's been convicted. That seems like a high indicator of past issues, which probably means he's more likely to reoffend. So that should be a high weight.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism directly, but maybe being underweight or overweight isn't related here. Maybe it's just about the arrest count.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014maybe living situation could influence if he has support, but since he's never married, perhaps he doesn't have a family network to rely on. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like drug use or high number of arrests.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education can play a role\u2014if he didn't finish high school, maybe he's more likely to engage in risky behavior again. So this should be considered a medium weight because it's important but not as critical as things like a lot of arrests.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Maybe having some work experience could provide stability, so this might actually lower the risk slightly. But since he has other serious factors like high arrest count and drug use, maybe this doesn't have a huge impact.\n\nDrug use is significant\u2014he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and most of the time now he feels down. Drug use can increase the risk of further issues because it can impair judgment and lead to more impulsive behavior. So that's definitely a high weight factor.\n\nMost of the time feeling down might indicate some level of emotional distress or depression. That could contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors, so another high weight factor.\n\nLived with his biological mother in an urban area when young. Maybe living with family can provide support, but since it was a long time ago (household size 2), perhaps the impact is less significant compared to more recent factors like high arrests or drug use. Still, some influence exists.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal issues. That might suggest he's more self-reliant and could take responsibility for his actions, which might lower risk slightly, but considering other harsher factors, maybe this doesn't counterbalance them enough.\n\nPutting it all together: high weight on the number of arrests (22 times), drug use (marijuana and cocaine), and lack of education. Medium weight on living alone and not being married. Some low weight on having a job and possibly considering religion's role.\n\nI think with so many high factors like multiple arrests, drug use, no education, it's more likely he'll reoffend within three years. The job factor might somewhat mitigate, but the other factors are too significant to ignore.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (22 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past and current drug use can lead to further substance abuse and impulsive behavior, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level (no diploma/GED)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education may contribute to unstable personal circumstances or decision-making that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment (1 job during the year)\", \"low\", \"Having a job can provide stability and reduce stress, which might slightly lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a family network may limit support and resources that could aid in reintegration and stability.\"),\n    (\"Emotional state (feeling down most of the time)\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood can contribute to substance abuse and risky behaviors, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family history (lived with biological mother in household size 2)\", \"low\", \"Living with family may provide some support but a long-ago situation might not have significant current impact compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
