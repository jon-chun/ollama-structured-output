    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this case based on the given risk factors and predict whether there's a recidivism within three years. The person is a 19-year-old Black male with multiple arrests and convictions, living alone without any education or employment history.\n\nFirst, his high number of arrests (9) and convictions suggests a history of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of recidivism. That would be a high risk factor.\n\nHis age being 19 might mean he's still developing, but since he has a significant past record, it's more about his current behavior than future potential.\n\nLiving alone without any family support could strain him socially and economically, possibly leading to further issues, so that's another medium to high risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED, which can hinder job opportunities and contribute to recidivism. That\u2019s definitely a high factor.\n\nNot being enrolled in college also points towards potential lack of educational support or motivation, adding to the risk.\n\nHis lack of employment history means he might not have resources to avoid criminal activities, making him at risk for future offenses.\n\nConsidering his living situation with 14 people in an urban area could create stress and dependency on the system, which is a medium-high risk factor.\n\nLastly, he believes in God's role, but since he hasn't felt depressed or involved in substance use, this might indicate some personal resilience, perhaps lowering the risk slightly from other factors.\n\nPutting all these together, despite one positive aspect regarding his spiritual belief, the overwhelming negatives about arrests, lack of education, and living conditions push him towards high recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"This individual has a history of multiple arrests (9) and convictions, indicating a strong tendency for criminal behavior that could lead to future rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, this individual is still developing, but their past criminal history suggests potential for continued involvement in the judicial system.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"high\", \"Currently living alone with no family support increases the risk of encountering challenges that may lead to further criminal activity or dependency issues.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED can limit educational opportunities and job prospects, potentially contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"No prior employment history shows no resources for stability or avoiding criminal activities, increasing the risk of future involvement in the system.\"),\n    (\"Current enrollment in college\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled suggests a lack of commitment to further education or personal development that could aid in avoiding recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother\", \"medium\", \"Living with 14 people in an urban area may create stress and dependency, contributing to higher risk factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
