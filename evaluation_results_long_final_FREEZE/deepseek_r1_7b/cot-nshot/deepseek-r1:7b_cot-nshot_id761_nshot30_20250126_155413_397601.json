    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The individual is a 20-year-old male, White, with two prior arrests but no convictions. He's 6'1\", weighs 180 lbs, single, living alone, has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college, held one job, no drug use, and no recent feelings of depression. He lived with both parents at age 5 in an urban area and believes in God.\n\nFirst, prior arrests: Two prior arrests without convictions might suggest some instability but aren't immediately alarming. Since there's no conviction, it indicates he hasn't faced any significant legal consequences beyond arrest.\n\nAge: Being 20 is a positive factor; younger individuals often have less criminal history. However, the number of prior arrests could still be a concern despite his age.\n\nRace: White is not typically associated with higher recidivism rates in general populations but doesn't inherently increase risk unless other factors are present. Since he's young and has no prior convictions, this might not heavily influence the prediction.\n\nWeight and height: 6'1\" and 180 lbs; while these aren't directly predictive of recidivism, they don't indicate any physical issues either. He doesn't appear to be at risk from substance abuse based on his weight or lack thereof.\n\nMarital status: Single living with no spouse might suggest he's not in a stable environment, which could affect his ability to make responsible decisions. However, since he's never married and has no kids mentioned, it's unclear if this directly impacts recidivism rates.\n\nNo children are mentioned, so that factor isn't present here. Education: High school diploma is actually beneficial as it often correlates with lower recidivism. Not being enrolled in college might be a risk if he finds it hard to commit, but since he has one job, it's less concerning.\n\nEmployment: Having held one job during the year suggests some stability and ability to support himself, which could reduce recidivism risk. However, if his job is unstable or underpaid, that could change things, but there's no info on that here.\n\nNo recent drug use: Being drug-free for four years is a strong positive indicator of lower risk compared to those who have used drugs before. He hasn't experienced any negative outcomes from substance use.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression: This is another positive sign. Depression can lead to poor decision-making, so not feeling depressed suggests better mental health and ability to make responsible choices.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household size 4 in an urban area at age 5: While living with parents might be associated with higher recidivism rates in some studies, since he's now 20 and presumably has moved out, this factor isn't as significant anymore. Urban areas can have varying levels of stability depending on the neighborhood.\n\nBelief in God: This is a personal belief that doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but might influence his decision-making. However, it's not a risk factor per se.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are positive except for two prior arrests without convictions and no college enrollment. The two prior arrests could slightly increase the risk compared to someone with no arrests, but since he's young and otherwise stable, these might not outweigh each other significantly. Without college enrollment, maybe there's a slight risk of less motivation or more instability in life choices, but again, his employment history is positive.\n\nConsidering all factors, while there are minor negatives like prior arrests and lack of college education, the positives like being White (no associated risk), high school diploma, no drug use, etc., make him at lower risk. The two prior arrests might increase the risk slightly to a medium level.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the risk factors:\n\n- Prior Arrests: Medium - Two prior arrests without convictions may slightly increase risk.\n- Education Level: High - High school diploma is associated with lower recidivism.\n- Employment History: High - Employed for one job indicates stability.\n- Drug Use: Low - No recent drug use correlates with lower risk.\n- Marital Status: Medium - Being single living with no spouse doesn't directly affect but isn't a strong positive either.\n- Belief in God: Low - Personal belief, not related to criminal behavior.\n\nOverall prediction: NO  \nConfidence level: 60%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"Medium\", \"Two prior arrests without convictions may slightly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"High\", \"High school diploma is associated with lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"High\", \"Employed for one job indicates stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Low\", \"No recent drug use correlates with lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"Medium\", \"Being single living with no spouse doesn't directly affect but isn't a strong positive either.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"Low\", \"Personal belief, not related to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
