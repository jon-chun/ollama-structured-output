    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by breaking down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female, White, with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's a significant risk factor because having a prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending. So that should be weighted high.\n\nHer weight is between 200 and 224 lbs, which is on the higher end but still within a healthy range. I don't see a direct link to recidivism based solely on her weight, so maybe this factor doesn't contribute much risk here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to substance use or depression, both of which are risk factors. So this should be weighted medium.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; without it, she's more likely to engage in risky behaviors again. That makes this factor high.\n\nShe has held one job during the year, which might indicate stable employment, but if she lost it due to substance use or other issues, that could be a risk. However, since she has one job, maybe it's not a strong indicator here, so perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. These drug-related issues are major red flags because they can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and lead to further legal or criminal consequences. This should definitely be high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of depression might suggest some coping mechanisms, but considering her prior drug use, which could have led to emotional strain, this factor is somewhat neutral, maybe medium.\n\nAt 20 years old with a prior conviction and living alone, she's at a higher risk for recidivism. This overall consideration points towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"Having one prior arrest and conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is within a healthy range, which does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and potential substance use or depression issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Having one job may indicate some stability, but it could be affected by past issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use history is a major risk factor for further criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression_history\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests she might have effective coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
