    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old male. Let me break down his risk factors step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a pretty clear indicator of a history of criminal behavior, which usually increases the chance of rearrest. So I'm thinking that's a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. His weight is within a healthy range for his height, so that doesn't seem to contribute much to risk unless there are other health issues mentioned, but there aren't any here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or potential substance abuse, which might correlate with higher recidivism rates. So this could also be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. educational attainment without further education might indicate lower self-control or opportunities, so that's another point towards high risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can sometimes show responsibility and stability, which are positive signs for recidivism. However, if he lost a job recently or has inconsistent work history, it could be a warning sign. But since there's no information on recent job loss or stability, I'll lean towards this being medium risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014suggests substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism because it can lead to impulsive behaviors or further legal issues. This definitely should be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's never felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate he's managing his substances without severe emotional distress. However, if there was a recent trauma or higher substance use, that could change things. Without more info, I'll consider this as medium risk since depression isn't mentioned.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of four in a rural area at a young age\u2014family support can be protective, but living in a large household might also indicate potential stressors. However, since he's now living alone and has a conviction, the family history is less relevant here.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his personal happenings\u2014that's subjective and indicates a higher likelihood of making impulsive decisions or facing moral dilemmas, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: three prior arrests (high), high school diploma without college (medium), living alone (high), substance use (high), and belief in divine involvement (high). The other factors don't add significant risk. So the overall risk is quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of three arrests, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Completing high school without further education may indicate lower self-control or opportunities for positive development.\"),\n    (\"current_residence\", \"high\", \"Living alone can contribute to instability and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years suggests possible impulsive behaviors that could lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of four indicates some level of family support, but this does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"moral_factors\", \"high\", \"Considering that the individual believes God has involvement in their life may increase impulsive decision-making and moral dilemmas.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
