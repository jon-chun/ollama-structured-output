    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who has been convicted once. That's a high risk because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nShe weighs only 110 lbs and is 5 feet 1 inch. Her weight might be a concern for substance use, but since she's already in treatment or enrolled in college, maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation alone can increase stress, but if she's attending school or working, it might offset some risk factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually means better job opportunities, so that's a lower risk factor.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple stable jobs generally reduces recidivism because it shows responsibility and employability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor for rearrest. Additionally, her feelings of low mood might be linked to substance use issues.\n\nShe's lived with both parents since childhood in an urban area. Being raised in such an environment can sometimes lead to stress but doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there were family issues.\n\nHer belief that God has no influence on her life might affect her motivation, possibly leading to lower self-esteem and increased risk of substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), living situation alone (moderate), education level (low), recent job stability (medium). The factors that pull her towards higher risk are the prior conviction, past drug use, and possible lack of motivation. However, education and job experience can mitigate some of these risks.\n\nConsidering all, she's on the edge. I'd lean towards a medium-high risk but might predict NO with lower confidence because of her education and stable employment history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as recidivism is commonly associated with individuals who have a history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly with both marijuana and cocaine, is strongly linked to higher rates of recidivism due to potential relapse and related behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress levels which may contribute to substance use or other negative behaviors but does not directly correlate with recidivism without additional risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma along with enrollment in college indicates a pathway towards better opportunities and reduced risky behaviors which mitigates the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility which can positively influence job readiness and employability reducing recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Frequency\", \"high\", \"Regular use of marijuana and cocaine indicates a potential for relapse and ongoing substance abuse which are significant contributors to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Parents in Urban Area\", \"low\", \"While living in an urban environment can sometimes lead to stressors, the absence of family issues does not inherently increase recidivism risk without other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Supernatural Influence (God)\", \"medium\", \"A lack of belief in a higher power might affect motivation and self-esteem which could influence substance use or other risky behaviors indirectly contributing to increased risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```",
