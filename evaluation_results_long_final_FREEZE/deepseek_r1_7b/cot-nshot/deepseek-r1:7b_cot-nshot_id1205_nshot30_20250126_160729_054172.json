    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 19-year-old female Black individual with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given information:\n\n- Age: 19 years old.\n- Race: Black.\n- Arrests: 1 time, not convicted.\n- Weight: 5'6\", 160 lbs.\n- Marital status: Never married, currently living alone.\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n- Employment: No jobs held during the year.\n- Drugs: Never used, no recent drug use.\n- Depression: Never felt depressed in the past four years.\n- Childhood environment: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area.\n- Beliefs: She considers God has nothing to do with her personal events.\n\nNow, I need to analyze each of these factors and determine their relative weight as risk factors for rearrest. Looking at the previous examples provided, certain factors like prior convictions, age, living situation, education, and childhood environment are significant.\n\n1. **Prior Arrests**: She has 1 arrest but no conviction. Since she's not convicted, this might be a mitigating factor compared to a prior conviction which could have more severe implications.\n2. **Age**: Being 19 is relatively young, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates as they enter adulthood, but her lack of experience might lower it.\n3. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Single and living alone are known risk factors for substance abuse and other criminal behaviors.\n4. **Education Level**: High school diploma without college enrollment could be a risk factor if she's looking to return to school or face job challenges that could lead to more crimes.\n5. **Employment**: No jobs held during the year might indicate instability, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n6. **Childhood Environment**: Living with her biological mother in an urban area might have had different influences compared to other examples where family environments vary.\n\nConsidering these factors and comparing them to previous cases:\n\n- Prior Arrests: Medium risk because it's a single arrest without a conviction.\n- Age: Maybe low, as she is quite young but still at an early stage of her life.\n- Marital Status and Living Alone: High risk due to potential for substance abuse or other personal issues leading to criminal behavior.\n- Education Level: Medium risk since high school diploma might mean some stability but also could lead to further challenges.\n- Employment: Low risk because not working could indicate underutilized opportunities, but it's a bit ambiguous without more context.\n- Childhood Environment: Maybe medium risk depending on the family dynamics and support structures.\n\nPutting this all together, her living situation and lack of education seem like the strongest indicators. However, she is quite young, which might reduce her risk slightly. Combining these factors, I lean towards a low confidence prediction of rearrest but acknowledge that without more data, especially on employment or education stability, it's hard to be certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"This individual has one prior arrest, which may indicate some risk factors like impulsive decisions.
