    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals might have a lower chance of reoffending within three years since they're closer to retirement or not yet established in their career. So that's probably low risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Since she's not behind bars, this factor might be medium because being arrested could mean she's motivated to change, but without a conviction, her history isn't as significant.\n\nHer weight is between 150-174 lbs. That's in the healthy range for someone her age and height, so no issues there\u2014low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone, which might suggest she has family support or maybe she's single-parenting, both of which can help prevent recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is generally as good as a degree for employment, so education is positive\u2014low risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests she's stable and capable of managing her finances, which reduces recidivism chances\u2014low risk.\n\nHer drug use history is clean; no drugs in the past four years, so that's a strong indicator against substance abuse issues\u2014low risk.\n\nSome of the time she feels down, but she might be dealing with personal issues. Not sure how this affects recidivism yet. Maybe if it's related to stress at work or family, but without more info, I can't assign too high a weight here\u2014maybe medium.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Being raised by a supportive family is protective against recidivism\u2014low risk.\n\nShe believes in God, which might provide some psychological support and reduce stress\u2014low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or none that would push the risk higher. She's relatively young, has a clean record, education, good job history, and supportive family. Her mood isn't a red flag unless it's severe. So my prediction is she won't rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\nThe case involves a 22-year-old female with several factors indicating low risk for recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old\u2014low risk due to being relatively young and possibly in a stable life stage.\n2. **Arrests/Criminals**: One arrest, no conviction\u2014low risk as motivation may be present but without a conviction, it's less impactful.\n3. **Weight**: Healthy weight range\u2014low risk related to health indicators.\n4. **Marital Status/Living Situation**: Never married and not living alone\u2014suggesting family support or single-parenting, which can aid in preventing recidivism\u2014low risk.\n5. **Education Level**: Holds a GED, not enrolled in college\u2014positive indicator with education contributing to employability\u2014low risk.\n6. **Employment History**: Employed four jobs during the year\u2014a stable job history reducing chances of reoffending\u2014low risk.\n7. **Drug Use**: No drug use in past four years and no recent down mood\u2014low risk related to substance abuse issues.\n8. **Family History/Living Arrangements**: Lives with biological mother in a household size three, urban area\u2014protective due to family support\u2014affecting recidivism risk\u2014low risk.\n9. **Mental Health/Mood**: Some down mood but not severe\u2014may relate to personal stress or issues beyond the current factors.\n\n**Prediction**: The individual has multiple protective factors with no significant risk indicators, suggesting low risk of rearrest within three years. Assign a high confidence level based on the protective factors outweighing potential contributing factors.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 22, which suggests she is relatively young and may have a lower risk of reoffending compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Criminals\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, so this could be a minor factor but not significant on its own.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is between 150 and 174 lbs., which is within the healthy range for her age and height.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"low\", \"She is never married and currently not living alone, suggesting she may have family support or be single-parenting.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.
