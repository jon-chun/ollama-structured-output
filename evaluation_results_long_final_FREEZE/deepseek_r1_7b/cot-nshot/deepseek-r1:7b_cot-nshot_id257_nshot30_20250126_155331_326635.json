    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old female. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals are generally at a lower risk of rearrest compared to adults, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe has one arrest but hasn't been convicted yet. A single non-convicted arrest isn't too significant on its own, especially if she's making progress in her case.\n\nHer weight is 120 lbs and height is 5'5\". She's living alone with no dependents, which is a positive sign as living arrangements can impact recidivism rates. She's enrolled in school, which could indicate good behavior or focus on self-improvement.\n\nShe has two job experiences, which might show she's actively seeking opportunities and possibly has some life stability that could reduce the risk of reoffending.\n\nUsing drugs is present\u2014marijuana use can sometimes lead to behavioral issues. The fact that she felt down during the month adds a layer; maybe she's struggling with mental health or stressors.\n\nShe lived in a household of six at a young age, which might indicate she had some support but could also suggest higher risk if there were family issues leading to her arrest now.\n\nHer belief in God is positive.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0 can provide support and cope mechanisms that help in reintegration.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one non-convicted arrest (low), living alone (high), school enrollment (high), two jobs (medium, but maybe high since job experience could correlate with stability), marijuana use (medium), feeling down (low?), household size six (low or medium depending on context), and religious belief (high). \n\nPutting this together, the overall risk factors don't seem too high. The positive aspects like school, job, and religion might outweigh some negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which generally reduces the likelihood of rearrest compared to older adults.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has one non-convicted arrest, which is not significant on its own and might indicate progress in her legal situation.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone with no dependents can positively impact recidivism risk as it may reduce exposure to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Education/Enrollment\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school suggests ongoing education or focus on personal development, which could aid in avoiding similar issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"She has two job experiences; however, employment can sometimes correlate with stable environments and reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana is present, which may correlate with behavioral patterns that could increase rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State During Past Month\", \"low\", \"Feeling down during the past month might indicate personal stressors but doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of six, which could suggest some level of family support or potential family issues leading to current arrest.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"She believes in God, which can provide support and coping mechanisms that may reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
