    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign weights to each risk factor for this case. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the person has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a single misdemeanor; that might be low to medium risk since it's a minor offense without a conviction.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 145 lbs. Weight alone isn't a big factor here unless it's related to substance use or physical health, which isn't mentioned.\n\nNever married living with someone else\u2014marital status can sometimes indicate support network strength but since he's not married, maybe no kids, so probably medium risk if anything.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Not having it might make him less likely to get better job opportunities, increasing recidivism\u2014so that's high risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. A job can provide stability, so maybe medium risk since only one job for a year isn't much.\n\nNo drug use and not feeling depressed in four years. Positive behavior suggests lower risk factors here.\n\nAt a young age lived with biological dad in a rural area\u2014rural living might offer different social opportunities but could also mean less support, possibly low to medium risk if he had positive experiences there.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014religion can provide guidance and structure, which might lower recidivism risk\u2014so that's medium or maybe high depending on the context.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: one misdemeanor, no diploma, being single living alone, one job, positive behavior. The education and lack of support from family could be significant. I think this person has a higher chance of reoffending in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time, not convictions)\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted can indicate potential for recidivism.
