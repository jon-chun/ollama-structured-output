    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 20-year-old male who's White, arrested once and convicted. He's 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Never married, living alone, has a high school diploma, enrolled in a 2-year college, held two jobs. Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but no depression feelings recently. At age young, lived with his biological mother in an urban household of size 4. Believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the risk factors from the examples given and see how they apply here. \n\n1. **Arrests and Convictions**: He has one arrest and it's a conviction. From the examples, having multiple arrests or convictions increases the risk. Here, just one, but it's noted as high risk in some cases.\n\n2. **Age**: 20 is relatively young, but not too old. Some examples with similar age had different outcomes based on other factors like living situation and drugs.\n\n3. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana and cocaine. In the examples, drug use was a significant factor. Both were present here, which could be high risk.\n\n4. **Employment**: He held two jobs but is currently enrolled in college. Some examples with employment had lower recidivism, but others with more stable employment didn't relapse. Here, he's actively working and studying, which might mitigate some risk.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married. In the examples, being married sometimes reduced recidivism, so being single could be a risk factor.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: Lived alone but with a high school diploma. Some examples of living at home had higher relapse rates when combined with other factors like drug use or prior convictions.\n\n7. **Religion/Support System**: Believes in God. In some cases, having religious support was protective, but here it's part of his belief system without necessarily providing help, so maybe low to medium risk.\n\n8. **Household Size and Location**: Lived with mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban areas sometimes have higher recidivism rates due to more resources or different social environments. Being in a larger household doesn't directly indicate risk but might relate to support networks.\n\nPutting it all together, his drug use is the most significant red flag here. The one prior arrest and conviction, along with living alone without a support system (though he's educated and enrolled in college), could be balancing factors. However, the presence of drug use often strongly correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nI think I'll assign high weight to drug use, medium to prior arrest, low to employment status but since he has two jobs and is in college, maybe medium? Also, living alone might be a medium risk factor because it's not as stable as having a support system. Marital status being never married could be low or medium.\n\nConsidering all this, the overall prediction leans towards NO for rearrest, but given the drug use and one prior arrest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe around 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which is noted as high risk in several examples where it contributed to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, particularly cocaine, was associated with higher recidivism rates in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs during the year but is currently enrolled in a 2-year college which could indicate proactive steps to avoid criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married; some sources suggest being married can be protective against recidivism, though this varies.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone without significant support from a partner or family, despite having a high school diploma and attending college.\"),\n    (\"Religion/Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes in God; religious factors can sometimes be protective but depend on the individual's support network within their faith community.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
