    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's an 18-year-old female Black with several specific circumstances. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old with only one arrest and a conviction. That doesn't seem like a lot of criminal history, so maybe not super high risk there. She's Black, which I know can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, but without more info on systemic issues or her current situation, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nHer physical stats are 5'10\" and 127 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless there's something about her weight affecting her ability to perform tasks, but she's also enrolled in college and working a job, so maybe she's in good shape.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase risk factors like stress or depression, but she says she hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually indicates some level of education that could help with future opportunities. She only held one job last year; maybe that was part-time or something, not sure if it affects her ability to support herself.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. I wonder if her drug use is recent or from earlier in life. Since she's young, maybe she's experimenting and hasn't hit hard drugs yet, which might not contribute much to risk.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of four in an urban area. That could have exposed her to certain environments or pressures that might influence her behavior or emotions. Urban areas can sometimes have higher stress levels or different dynamics compared to smaller towns.\n\nHer religious belief is mentioned too, which might provide support and coping mechanisms but isn't directly related to risk unless she's been impacted by it in a negative way.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a clean record except for one arrest, living alone with no recent issues, education that seems solid, and some positive factors like her religion. The only concern is maybe her drug use history if it's problematic now, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, perhaps she's managed it okay.\n\nI think her risk level might be on the lower side here. The factors don't point strongly towards high risk unless there are underlying issues not mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
