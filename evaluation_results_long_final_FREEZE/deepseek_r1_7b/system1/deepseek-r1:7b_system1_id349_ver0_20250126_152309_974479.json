    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. So, we have a 22-year-old male who is White. He's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because prior convictions are a strong indicator of past behavior issues.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 212 lbs, but I don't think his physical characteristics directly contribute to risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or health issues. He hasn't been married and is living alone, which could be a sign of instability, but not sure yet how significant that is.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, so he's presumably educated but maybe struggling with academic challenges. Not working during the year might indicate lack of motivation or job seeking skills. That could contribute to higher recidivism risk.\n\nHe uses marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can have behavioral impacts; while it's not severe here, substance abuse often correlates with other risky behaviors. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so no immediate signs of mental health issues that might influence his risk.\n\nLived with both biological parents at a young age (age 6) in a household of six in an urban area. That's quite a big family living together, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to living conditions or neglect if not properly supervised. However, the fact that he considers God involved suggests strong moral support and possibly better behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are major red flags. Drug use and possible instability from living with many people could increase risk. Education level might indicate some ability but also maybe a lack of focus or support system. Not working and no depression don't immediately point to high risk, but the prior criminal history is significant.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk assessment because of the arrest record and other factors that can contribute to further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
