    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. The output needs to be a JSON object with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, the person is White, but I don't think race plays a significant role here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated. He's been arrested once but not convicted, so he has a clean criminal record in terms of convictions, just one arrest. That might be mitigating factors because convictions are more impactful.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 145 lbs. No information on BMI or health issues yet, though weight is below average for his height. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years; that's a good sign as substance use can correlate with higher risk behavior like drug use now.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests he's mentally stable. No history of depression, which is positive. He lived with his biological dad in a household of four in a rural area at a young age. Living with multiple family members might indicate some stress or emotional factors from his upbringing, but it could also mean he has good support.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often a strong predictor of recidivism; not having one might increase future risk if he's motivated to self-educate now.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Job stability can affect financial stability, which in turn affects personal well-being and ability to support oneself or family.\n\nNo history of substance abuse, no depression, so he seems to be on track mentally. His past living situation could have challenges but isn't directly a risk factor unless it's associated with other negatives like higher crime rates in rural areas, though that's speculative.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one arrest (mitigating), clean substance use (mitigating), no prior mental health issues, moderate support from family, lack of education and job stability. These seem to lean towards low risk rather than high risk. So I'd predict \"NO\" with a confidence level around 20-30% because there are mitigating factors but also some underlying concerns like potential challenges from past living conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
