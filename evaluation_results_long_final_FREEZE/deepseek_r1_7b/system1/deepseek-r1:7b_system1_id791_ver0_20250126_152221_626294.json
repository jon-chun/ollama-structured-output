    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of race as a predictive factor, but it's good to note.\n\nShe has two arrests and a conviction. That's a significant criminal history. Recidivism is high among those with multiple prior convictions, so that's concerning.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 120 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is here; maybe related to substance use but not certain.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability from a partner can be positive, indicating she might not be at risk for high-risk behaviors unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not in college. This could mean she has low educational support, which is often associated with higher risk of engaging in risky behavior like drug use.\n\nShe hasn't held a job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances because there's no alternative income, increasing drug use likelihood.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Marijuana use itself isn't necessarily bad unless it leads to substance abuse issues, which she might be experiencing now or could develop.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area. That's a tough upbringing. Living with multiple family members can sometimes lead to emotional instability or dependency, especially if there was neglect or abuse. Her belief in God might counteract some negative influences but doesn't negate the impact of that challenging environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: two arrests, no job, lack of education, drug use history, and a tough childhood. These are all indicators of high risk for reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
