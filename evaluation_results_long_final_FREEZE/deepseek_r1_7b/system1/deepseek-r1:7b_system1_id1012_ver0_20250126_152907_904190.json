    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old Black female who was arrested once and convicted.Convictions are a red flag, especially since it's her first offense. That could mean she has some underlying issues that led to the arrest.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Her height is below average, which might contribute to lower body weight or obesity if BMI is considered. Being in a low-weight category can be associated with higher risk of certain health issues, but without knowing her BMI, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's living alone, not married, and hasn't worked during the year. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to increased stress or substance use. Not working could indicate she's facing financial difficulties or has lost job opportunities due to circumstances like unemployment.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a significant factor in reducing recidivism. Without it, she might have fewer support systems and higher chances of falling into similar situations again.\n\nUsing drugs, particularly marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years could be problematic. Substance abuse often goes hand in hand with other negative behaviors like not sleeping well or experiencing mood swings, which can increase stress levels.\n\nShe felt so down for most of the past month that nothing could cheer her up. Persistent feelings of depression are a serious mental health issue and can lead to substance use disorders as a coping mechanism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family living conditions can significantly impact someone's well-being and behavior. Small households might not provide enough supervision or emotional support, potentially leading to behavioral issues later on.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal life. This indicates a strong religious affiliation, which can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if the religion promotes antisocial practices or superstititions as part of their teachings.\n\nPutting all these together: First-time conviction at 21 is concerning. Her living situation and family dynamics might contribute to stress or substance use. She's without support systems like education and employment, which are crucial for managing personal issues effectively. Her mental health indicators, such as persistent drug use and mood issues, suggest she may need help but isn't currently accessing it.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, her risk level is high. She has multiple warning signs across different domains: criminal history, family environment, education, employment, substance abuse, and mental health. Each of these contributes to a higher likelihood of reoffending or experiencing other negative outcomes in the future.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
