    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male of African American descent. Socioeconomic factors often play a role in recidivism rates. Being from an African American background can sometimes be associated with systemic issues that might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. The number of prior arrests is a factor, but since he's not convicted yet, this might indicate that the offense wasn't severe or he was able to avoid custody. However, even a single arrest without a conviction can still be significant in risk assessment.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; they're more physical characteristics than risk indicators.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect stability, but without more information on how stable his current life is or if he has support networks, it's hard to gauge the impact on risk.\n\nEducation level: He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of lower recidivism rates. Without education, especially in a time when many jobs require some level of education, this could increase his risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Employment stability can influence recidivism because having a job provides a sense of purpose and direction, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years; that's positive and can indicate good sobriety, which is linked to lower risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health stability is another factor. Depression can sometimes be a trigger for criminal behavior if not properly addressed.\n\nHis background: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This suggests he's part of a larger family living in an urban setting. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and different social dynamics that might contribute to risk behaviors.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or spirituality, which some studies suggest might be associated with higher recidivism rates due to less guidance and more personal responsibility.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest without a conviction, no education, living alone, no job, no drug use, and a potential lack of religious support. These points lean towards high risk because each contributes to instability or vulnerability in different areas.\n\nI should assign a confidence level based on how many of these factors are significant indicators. Since most of the factors are pointing towards higher risk without any mitigating positive signs like employment or education, I'll set the confidence at 85%. This means there's an 85% chance that this person has a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
