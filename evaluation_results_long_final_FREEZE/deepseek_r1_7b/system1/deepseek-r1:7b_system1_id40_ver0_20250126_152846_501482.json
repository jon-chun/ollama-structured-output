    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze the given risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old male Hispanic, who has been arrested three times and convicted. He's separated, living alone, lacks a high school diploma or GED, isn't enrolled in college, hasn't worked during the year, uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine), and feels down for much of the past month. Additionally, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area at a young age and doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is significant. Arresting three times and having a conviction already puts him at risk. Repeated offenses often lead to longer sentences or supervision, which can affect his stability.\n\nHe's 21 years old, so he's still relatively young, but without a high school diploma or GED, combined with not being enrolled in college, suggests he might be undereducated and possibly struggling with basic skills. This could impact his ability to function independently, which is another indicator of risk.\n\nLiving alone can be isolating; he doesn't have support from family or friends, especially since he's separated. Without a network, he may experience higher stress or anxiety.\n\nHis drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, particularly in recent months when feeling down, suggests substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a strong risk factor as it can lead to further instability, legal issues, or health problems.\n\nFeeling \"down\" for much of the time points towards depression or some mood disorder. This could affect his motivation and ability to engage with daily activities, potentially increasing risk behavior.\n\nLiving in a household of four without biological parents might have contributed to his current challenges. Growing up in such an environment can lead to dependency issues, which might influence his substance use and overall well-being.\n\nHis lack of belief in God may not directly affect his risk but could indicate potential stress or coping mechanisms that don't involve seeking help from a religious source, possibly leading to isolation.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests, lack of education, substance abuse, recent emotional distress, living alone due to separation, and a history of unstable family environments. These are all red flags for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
