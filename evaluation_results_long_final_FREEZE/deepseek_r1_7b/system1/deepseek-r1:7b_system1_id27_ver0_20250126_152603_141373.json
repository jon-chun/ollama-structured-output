    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. \n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. That alone doesn't raise immediate red flags, but it's worth noting her age and race in context.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That suggests she might be in custody but hasn't been formally charged to trial. This could indicate some underlying issues that haven't reached a conclusion yet.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and she weighs 139 lbs, which places her at a healthy weight for her height. No information on any health issues here.\n\nShe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of possible stress or social isolation, especially if she feels down all the time. \n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college, which might suggest she's seeking some education but hasn't started higher education yet. That could be a positive sign, though she's been employed for two jobs.\n\n drug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, but specifically mentioned that during the last month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This persistent drug use might indicate ongoing struggles with addiction or possible relapse.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of four in an urban area. That environment might have had both positive and negative influences, but it's possible she learned some coping mechanisms from there.\n\nHer belief in God could be a strength, but it also means she might not seek help when needed, relying on her faith instead of other support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: She has no prior convictions, so the risk of reoffending is lower. Her drug use is inconsistent but shows some recent struggle, which isn't immediately concerning unless it's a pattern. Her living situation could contribute to emotional instability but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Her age being 21 also means she's in her prime years and might be more motivated to change.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low risk here because the factors don't strongly indicate a high need for intervention. However, considering she feels down all the time without any support, that could increase the risk of internalizing negative emotions or seeking help which hasn't been provided yet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
