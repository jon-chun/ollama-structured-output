    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't immediately raise red flags, but race can be a factor in some assessments based on stereotypes, though I should be cautious about that.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s just one offense; however, being convicted does show criminal history, which can indicate past behavior issues.\n\nHer height is 5'3\" and she weighs 155 lbs. This makes her underweight for her height. Underweight individuals might have lower self-esteem or substance use issues, so that's something to consider.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Living in a stable household usually correlates with better social support and lower risk of criminal behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she's making an effort not to continue education, which might be linked to low self-esteem or substance abuse.\n\nShe holds two jobs during the year. Having multiple income sources generally reduces financial stress, so that's a positive indicator.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is mild compared to harder drugs like cocaine or alcohol, but even casual use can have psychological effects. Not feeling depressed might suggest she's managing her substance use well, though it could also be a sign of low engagement with other aspects of life.\n\nShe lived at a young age in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might contribute to social issues like substance abuse or behavioral problems due to living with multiple people who may not provide positive influences.\n\nLastly, she believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can correlate with certain behaviors; however, it's important to note that all religious individuals aren't necessarily high risk, but this might suggest a lack of secular support or involvement in risky activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest, being White (neutral), living situation in a rural area with multiple family members, substance use (marijuana), not feeling depressed recently, low education, working two jobs. She's married and has stable living conditions. The negative factors seem to be outweighed by the positives.\n\nI think while there are some concerns about her past behavior and living conditions, she presents as having positive attributes like stability and employment. So overall, I might lean towards not high risk but perhaps lower than average. Maybe a confidence level of around 40-50%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
