    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. That might not be directly linked to risk unless there's a stereotype involved, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Her past convictions are two, but since she's only 22, it's possible that these convictions are minor or from earlier in her life. The number of prior arrests also matters; two times isn't too bad if they were for minor offenses.\n\nHer height and weight don't provide much info on risk factors unless there's a concern about health issues, but she's just 5'5\" and 130 lbs, which is within a normal range. Her marital status is single, living alone \u2013 again, not inherently a risk factor unless combined with other issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually indicates some level of education that might lead to better job opportunities and stability. She's held only one job during the year; that could be a red flag if it was a low-paying or unstable position, but without more context on her current employment status, I can't say for sure.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. While drug use can impact behavior and relationships, recent marijuana use might not directly correlate to high risk unless there's evidence of substance abuse disorder or ongoing issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression is a serious mental health issue that could affect her ability to manage daily tasks or work, but the lack of symptoms here doesn't necessarily indicate low risk.\n\nLiving with other adults in an urban area since a young age, in a household of five. That's a lot of people living together, which can be stressful and might influence her behavior. The environment she grew up in could have both positive and negative impacts on her risk profile.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has religious support and some level of mental health coping mechanisms, which is generally protective against certain types of stressors.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions, living with multiple adults, substance use (marijuana), no recent depression. The education level and being in college might provide some stability. She's 22, so the risk peaks are probably lower than in older individuals. Her current job situation isn't clear\u2014only one held during the year. Without more info on employment stability or other risk factors like criminal history beyond convictions, I'd lean towards a low confidence level.\n\nSo, considering all these points and her age, I think the overall risk is not high enough to label her as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
