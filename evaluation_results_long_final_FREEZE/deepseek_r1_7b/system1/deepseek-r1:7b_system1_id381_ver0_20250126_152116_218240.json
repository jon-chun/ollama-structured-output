    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual based on their background and circumstances.\n\nFirst, age: 19 years old. Young adults often have less life experience but are still considered to be at a point where they might make impulsive decisions or seek help without considering long-term consequences. This isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high risk alone.\n\nNationality: White. This factor is complex and varies based on societal perceptions, but generally, being White doesn't inherently indicate higher risk unless it's tied to specific systemic issues. So, it might not be a primary concern here.\n\nArrests: 1 time, not convicted. A single arrest can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or potential supervision, which could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors if not addressed properly. However, one arrest isn't typically a major red flag unless followed by further issues.\n\nGender: Male. Being male doesn't inherently make someone riskier than another gender, but it's often associated with certain types of risk-taking behavior in different contexts.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 155 lbs. While physical characteristics can sometimes be linked to substance use or risky behaviors if not within a healthy range, this alone doesn't strongly indicate high risk without additional context on diet, exercise, or health status.\n\nMarital status: Currently living alone and never married. Living alone is common for young adults, especially males, but it doesn't inherently correlate with higher risk unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse leading to isolation.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma and currently enrolled in a 4-year college. Education can be a protective factor as higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of risky behaviors. However, if there's a disconnect between educational aspirations and actual achievements or if there are other challenges, it might be a concern.\n\nOccupation: Has held only one job during the year. Job instability can lead to substance use as a coping mechanism for stress or lack of purpose. This could potentially increase risk but isn't definitive on its own.\n\nDrug use: Past four years include marijuana use, and in the past month, felt down and couldn't find any cheer. This is a significant indicator of potential substance abuse. Substance use can lead to risky behaviors like self-harm, accidents, or involvement with law enforcement, which all contribute to higher risk.\n\nYouthful living situation: Lived with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area. Younger siblings living together could mean shared responsibilities and environments that might influence behavior. However, this alone doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God to be involved in his personal life. This is a personal choice without direct correlation to risk levels but can sometimes influence decision-making regarding health and safety issues.\n\nPutting it all together: The individual has a history of substance use, which is a strong indicator of potential risky behaviors. The presence of a single arrest doesn't necessarily negate this but could suggest underlying issues that need addressing. However, the primary red flags here are the drug use and the potential for coping mechanisms leading to further issues.\n\nConsidering all factors, especially the recent substance use and possible underlying stress from living with both parents in a large household, it's reasonable to categorize this as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\nThe individual has a history of drug use, which is a significant indicator of potential risky behaviors. The single arrest and possible stress from living with both parents in a large household add to the risk factors. While these are not definitive on their own, they collectively suggest a high risk.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
