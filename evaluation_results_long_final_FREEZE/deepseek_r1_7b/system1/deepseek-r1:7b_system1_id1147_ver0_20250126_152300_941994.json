    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this risk factor step by step. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male with three arrests and a conviction. Age-wise, being 21 might indicate he's still in his prime years, but having multiple arrests can be a red flag.\n\nHe's described as being clean now from drugs (marijuana) for the past four years, which is positive, but only if he hasn't been using recently. His living situation alone adds some instability, even though it's not specified how long he's been doing this.\n\nEducational background: He has no high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. This could mean he lacks stability in life due to educational barriers, which often stems from family issues or other challenges.\n\nEmployment history: Only one job during the year might indicate he's somewhat stable but could also be underemployed or not seeking better opportunities. Job instability can lead to dependency on transient income sources and may contribute to higher risk.\n\nReligious beliefs are mentioned; sometimes religion can provide a sense of purpose, which might reduce recidivism in some cases. However, it's subjective and doesn't directly correlate with risk without more context.\n\nThe fact that he was raised in a household of six as a young person could suggest family issues or a lack of support system early on, which often correlates with higher risk behavior later in life.\n\nHis drug use history is only for marijuana, but even so, any substance use can have negative long-term consequences. The lack of recent feelings of depression might indicate he's mentally stable now, but past experiences could play a role.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple arrests suggest a history of problematic behavior. Age being 21 might mean he hasn't faced too many consequences yet, but having three convictions is still concerning. Educational and employment gaps can lead to unstable situations which might contribute to further issues. Living alone without a family support system could increase vulnerability.\n\nThe lack of recent drug use (only marijuana) and no depression in the past month are positives that might reduce risk, but they don't outweigh the negative factors like prior convictions and living circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I lean towards him being at high risk despite some mitigating factors. The multiple arrests and potential family issues are strong indicators of higher likelihood to engage in risky behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
