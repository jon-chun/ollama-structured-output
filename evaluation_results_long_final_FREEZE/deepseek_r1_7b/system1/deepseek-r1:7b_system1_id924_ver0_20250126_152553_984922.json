    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male Hispanic individual. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested twice and convicted. That seems like a significant factor because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. So that's a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nNext, his physical characteristics: 5 feet 8 inches and 160 lbs. Not sure if those specifics affect much here since they don't indicate any health issues or previous crimes related to substance abuse beyond what's already mentioned.\n\nHe's living alone, which might suggest he doesn't have a support system, potentially increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors without supervision.\n\nHis lack of a high school diploma and GED could mean limited opportunities and higher chances of engaging in risky activities. Not attending college further points towards lower educational aspirations, which can lead to unstable situations.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor; it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and contribute to various negative outcomes like theft or violence.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some substance use might lead to depression symptoms, if he's not feeling it now, does that mean he's more motivated to change his behavior? Or is this a red flag because of past issues?\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area at a young age. That suggests a potential for abuse or neglect, which can have long-term effects on an individual's behavior and mental health.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might contribute to risky behaviors as he turns to other sources of motivation or none at all.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions, drug use, living alone, limited education, early abuse/neglect, and a lack of religious support all point towards high risk. The presence of prior convictions is particularly strong. So, I'd lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
