    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 22 years old and male, White. Age-wise, being 22 might be considered young, but since he's already been arrested three times and convicted once, that's a significant risk indicator regardless of age. Each prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can definitely contribute to criminal behavior, although it's not as severe as other drug substances like alcohol or meth. Still, past use is concerning.\n\nHis living situation: he's not living alone and hasn't been married. Being in a non-marital status without a support system could increase vulnerability to substance abuse and unstable environments.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not continuing education might mean he doesn't have the skills needed for stable employment, which can lead to re-entering the criminal justice system.\n\nOnly holding one job during the year suggests limited income stability or opportunities. Joblessness can be a root cause of poverty and substance abuse issues.\n\nHe reported not feeling depressed over the past month. A lack of mental health support could mean he's not addressing underlying issues that might contribute to risk behaviors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household size of three in a rural area at a young age. This might indicate family dysfunction or exposure to domestic violence, which can have long-term effects on behavior and risk-taking.\n\nConsidering that God has some influence on his life shows he's seeking religious support, which is generally positive but doesn't directly relate to criminal risk unless there are underlying issues with trust or relationships elsewhere.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, unstable living situation, lack of education, limited employment, and no recent mental health issues. These factors point towards a high risk of future criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
