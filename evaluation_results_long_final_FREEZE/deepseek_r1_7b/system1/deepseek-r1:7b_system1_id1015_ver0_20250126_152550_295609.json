    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests are definitely a big red flag because they increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Conviction means he's already had some negative impact on his life, so that should tip the scale towards high risk.\n\nNext, he's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs between 200 to 224 lbs. That puts him in a heavier category. Being overweight can lead to health issues which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. I know that obesity is linked with drug use, which ties back to his past use of marijuana.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily make someone at risk, but it could mean he has fewer support systems around him. Without a family or friends to rely on, he might turn to other substances or engage in risky behaviors because there's no one to check him or provide guidance.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a significant factor in reducing recidivism. Without education, someone might not have the necessary skills for job opportunities or effective communication, increasing their chances of engaging in risky activities.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can help with financial stability and reduce stress, but if he's only had three over a year, it might indicate that finding steady employment is challenging. This could lead to financial strain, which sometimes leads people towards substance abuse or other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have mental health consequences, but if he's not experiencing depression now, it might mean he's managed it without severe issues. However, past drug use could still predict future use and potential substance-related risks.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have both positive and negative effects. Urban areas often provide more opportunities but can also be places of higher crime or stress, which might influence someone's behavior negatively.\n\nFinally, he doesn't believe in God. This is a personal belief that could affect his decision-making and interactions with the community. Without religious guidance, he might make impulsive decisions or associate with environments that are not conducive to positive behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: two prior convictions, weight issues linked to substance use, living alone without support, lack of education, limited job experience, past drug use, urban environment, and personal beliefs. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
