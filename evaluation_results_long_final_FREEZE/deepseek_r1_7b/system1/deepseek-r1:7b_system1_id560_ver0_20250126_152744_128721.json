    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut tribe. His age is young, but his past convictions mean two previous arrests and convictions. That's significant because reoffending potential is a key indicator of risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. Not sure how this affects risk, maybe related to physical activity or health issues? Probably not directly relevant unless there are other factors tied to his weight.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and single. Living alone can be a red flag for possible substance abuse or neglect. He lacks a high school diploma or GED, which might indicate poor educational background that could contribute to unstable situations.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, so income is an issue. Unemployment often leads to financial stress and possibly drug use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down sometimes. Substance abuse can lead to underlying mental health issues, which can increase recidivism risk.\n\nHis history of living with both biological parents at age 3 or younger in an urban area suggests possible exposure to substance abuse or neglect. This could influence his mental health and family environment.\n\nHe believes in God's role in his life, which might help with substance use if he's using it as a coping mechanism rather than for addiction. However, that belief doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there's evidence of misuse.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions, substance abuse (marijuana), living alone, low educational background, unemployment, and a history of family living conditions. These factors are all known to be associated with higher recidivism rates. The presence of marijuana use along with other risk factors like lack of education, unemployment, and unstable living situation increases the confidence level.\n\nConsidering each factor's weight: two prior convictions (high), substance abuse (moderate), living alone (moderate), low education (moderate), unemployment (moderate). Combining these, it seems high risk. So prediction is YES with a confidence of 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
