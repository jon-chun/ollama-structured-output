    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested multiple times and convicted. She's Hispanic, married, living alone, with a high school diploma but not in college, has two jobs, hasn't used drugs in four years, isn't depressed lately, lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area, and doesn't believe in God affecting her life.\n\nFirst, the multiple arrests and convictions are red flags. Each arrest can increase risk, especially if it's for serious offenses. She has five arrests and is convicted\u2014this suggests past problematic behavior that might continue.\n\nHer age at 21 isn't too young, but considering she's been through five arrests, that's concerning. Being Hispanic doesn't directly indicate high risk without more context, but in some areas, minority groups have higher arrest rates for similar offenses.\n\nMarried and living alone\u2014marital status can affect risk factors, but not sure if being married increases it here unless there are issues with support or domestic problems. Not enrolled in college might mean she's focused on work or other responsibilities, which could be a positive.\n\nShe has two jobs, which is good for stability, reducing unemployment-related risks. No drug use in four years and no depression in the past month\u2014positive indicators that her current behavior is healthy and perhaps more likely to maintain that.\n\nLiving with her mother in a household of four in an urban area might suggest family support or living conditions that could influence her well-being. However, it doesn't directly correlate with high risk if she's functioning well.\n\nHer lack of belief in God might be related to substance abuse or other issues, but without evidence, it's hard to link. She has a high school diploma and isn't pursuing higher education; maybe she's looking for stable employment which could help prevent further issues.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, convictions, no drug use, good mental health, family support\u2014these factors might suggest she's at moderate risk but with some signs of stability. The lack of significant negative indicators in recent times could mean her current behavior is positive, so maybe lower risk.\n\nI'm not sure if 21 years old plays into this as high risk because often that age is when people are making decisions for their future. But considering the past behavior, it might be safer to lean towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
