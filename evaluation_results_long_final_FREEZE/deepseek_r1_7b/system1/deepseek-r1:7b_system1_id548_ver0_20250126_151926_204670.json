    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 18-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's white but hasn't been convicted yet\u2014so no prior incarceration. That might lower some risk indicators since convictions are often used as control variables in risk assessments.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and 130 lbs. Not sure how height affects risk here unless there's something about her body type or accessibility, which doesn't seem relevant.\n\nLiving alone is a bit concerning, but not by itself a high-risk indicator. Maybe if she's unstable socially, but that's speculative.\n\nShe's enrolled in school\u2014that\u2019s positive; education can correlate with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe held three jobs in the past year. Job experience usually isn't directly linked to risk unless it's about substance use or previous instability.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some recent drug use\u2014maybe not too bad, but I need to consider recency. She felt down for most of the last month; that could be related to drug use or other stressors.\n\nYoung age at living with biological dad in a household of four\u2014it might indicate family environment issues, possibly neglect or abuse if she's not doing well. But it depends on more info like if there were any incidents reported.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014religion can influence behavior; however, it varies widely and isn't directly a risk factor unless it's part of a structured support system that's missing here.\n\nPutting this all together: The most concerning factors are the drug use (past four years, including recent) and feeling down. The recent drug use could indicate substance abuse issues which might affect her ability to function or make responsible decisions. However, she's in school now, so perhaps she's working on managing these issues.\n\nThe fact that she's living alone without a family support system is another risk factor\u2014it suggests potential social isolation or instability, which can lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nConsidering the job history and education are positive indicators, they might mitigate some of the negative factors. But the drug use and emotional state should be taken seriously as red flags.\n\nSo overall, while there's no direct high-risk indicator here, these factors could increase the risk enough for cautious consideration.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
