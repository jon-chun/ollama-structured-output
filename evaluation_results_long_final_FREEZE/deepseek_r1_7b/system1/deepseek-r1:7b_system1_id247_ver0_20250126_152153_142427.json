    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: 20 years old. Young adults can sometimes be considered low risk because they are still developing socially and legally. However, being arrested twice might change that perception.\n\nRace: White. I don't think race directly affects risk assessment unless there's a systemic bias in the system, which isn't indicated here. So maybe not much impact.\n\nConvictions: He has been convicted before. That definitely raises the risk level because prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 2 inches and 275 lbs. While this might indicate obesity, unless there's a history of health issues or drug-related problems linked to his weight, it might not directly correlate with recidivism. But since he has used drugs recently, maybe that ties into other factors.\n\nMarital status: Married living with spouse. Stability in marital status usually correlates with lower risk because of the support system and accountability.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not college. Some argue that higher education can lead to better job opportunities and reduce recidivism, but if he's not actively seeking further education or using it for positive purposes, this might not be a strong indicator on its own.\n\nNumber of jobs: 2 during the year. Employed part-time or has a stable job could contribute to lower risk compared to someone unemployed or underemployed.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both legal and mental health impacts, so it's a bit conflicting here. If he's using drugs recreationally without severe issues, maybe that doesn't necessarily increase risk as much as other factors like ongoing substance abuse.\n\nUpbringing: lived with both parents at young age in an urban area of a household size 5. A large family can sometimes provide more support but might also have its challenges, such as living in a crowded environment which could lead to stress or exposure. However, the mention of God having something to do with his personal events suggests a sense of purpose and maybe less likelihood of substance abuse.\n\nReligion: He believes God is involved in his life. A strong moral compass can reduce risk, but it's not always directly measurable in risk assessments.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior convictions are a major red flag (high risk). Age 20 is typically low risk unless there are concurrent issues like substance use or unstable family environment. However, considering he has used drugs recently and a history of living with multiple parents who might have contributed to his drug use in the past, these factors lean towards high risk.\n\nI think overall, despite some mitigating factors like being married and having a diploma, the key factors here are prior convictions and recent substance use, which point towards a high risk. So I'll set the prediction to \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
