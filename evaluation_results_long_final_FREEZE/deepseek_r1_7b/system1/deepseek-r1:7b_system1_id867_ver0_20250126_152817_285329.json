    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 19 might be considered at-risk age, but without more context about his behavior or circumstances, I can't make an immediate judgment.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Multiple arrests often indicate potential for future offenses, especially if they're minor charges like marijuana use. However, since he's not convicted yet, maybe the risk is lower than someone with a full conviction.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly related to risk unless there are health concerns, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of instability, but again, without knowing more about his personal circumstances or social support, it's hard to assess the impact on risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. This suggests he might have some educational background that could lead to better opportunities, which might reduce recidivism risk compared to someone with less education.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience can be beneficial as it shows ability to support himself and potentially avoid higher risks associated with being unemployed or dependent on welfare.\n\nIn the past four years, he used drugs (marijuana), and recently felt down for much of the month. Drug use is a significant risk factor because substance abuse can lead to self-harm, violence, or other risky behaviors.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood might indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems are strong predictors of recidivism, often due to increased vulnerability to stressors and access to harmful substances.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to family dynamics that might include neglect or abuse if the individual has indicated such behavior (which isn't mentioned here). The lack of information about this affects my judgment slightly.\n\nThe individual states that God has nothing to do with their personal life, which might indicate a belief system that could be associated with risk-taking behaviors, but without more context on how this belief impacts his actions or decisions, it's unclear.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (though not convictions), substance use (marijuana), recent low mood indicating possible mental health issues, living in a family of four, and a lack of religious involvement. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
