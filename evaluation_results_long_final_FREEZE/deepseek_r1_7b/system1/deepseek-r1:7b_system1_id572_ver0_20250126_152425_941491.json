    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age-wise, being in his late twenties might be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to younger individuals who are still developing their skills or families. However, that alone isn't enough to classify him as high risk; it depends on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Multiple arrests significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior because each arrest can lead to more involvement with the justice system, potentially leading to substance abuse issues, unstable living situations, or lack of motivation to change. So this is a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. Without information on his BMI or body composition, it's hard to assess if his weight is problematic, but given that he's not enrolled in college and has only three jobs over the past year, maybe he's underemployed or struggling with work-life balance.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation and increased stress, which might contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral issues. However, without knowing his mental health history or any support systems, it's a bit speculative but still points towards moderate risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not continuing education after high school could indicate a lack of motivation or opportunities for personal growth, which might be a red flag for delinquency.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs is generally positive as it can provide financial stability and reduce stress from unemployment. However, if he's been laid off recently or has inconsistent income, that could pose a risk.\n\nUsing drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) shows substance abuse history. Substance use disorder is a significant predictor of recidivism because it often leads to unstable behavior, legal issues, and family dysfunction. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month but has drug use history, which could be linked to mental health issues that contribute to higher risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with both biological parents in a rural area at a young age might have had a complex effect on his behavior. While rural areas can sometimes offer different dynamics compared to urban settings, the presence of all four family members could indicate more support or perhaps challenges like sibling rivalry. His belief in God suggests he has some level of spirituality or faith, which might help mitigate risk factors but doesn't necessarily reduce them if other factors are present.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (3), substance abuse history, living alone, lack of college education, not being employed full-time, and a high school diploma. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
