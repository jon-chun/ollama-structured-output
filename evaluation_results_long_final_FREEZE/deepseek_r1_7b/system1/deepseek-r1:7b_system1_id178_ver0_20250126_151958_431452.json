    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who is a high risk based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male at 20 years old with 8 arrests and convictions. That's a lot of prior convictions which typically indicate higher risk because they have more history of violating laws.\n\nHe's only 5'7\" and 154 lbs\u2014maybe underweight or has health issues? Not sure if that affects risk, but weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies.\n\nLiving alone with no high school diploma or GED shows he might not have the skills needed to get out of prison successfully. Maybe limited job opportunities could lead to more incarceration.\n\nHe's been employed two jobs, which is better than nothing but still low. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years isn't great either; drug abuse can really mess with someone's life and increase chances of getting into trouble again.\n\nHis mood swings are severe sometimes\u2014feeling so down that he couldn't be cheered up. That's a sign of emotional instability, which is a risk factor in recidivism studies because unstable mental states might make it harder to reintegrate into society after release.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 7 in an urban area could have had some protective factors or maybe exposed him to stressors that could affect his behavior. However, the impact of such a situation on recidivism isn't clear without more info.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some support but doesn't directly indicate high risk; it's a personal factor and not necessarily linked to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all these together\u20148 arrests, no education, drug use, severe mood issues, living with family in an urban area\u2014the risk is definitely high. I'll say YES with 90% confidence because of the multiple negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
