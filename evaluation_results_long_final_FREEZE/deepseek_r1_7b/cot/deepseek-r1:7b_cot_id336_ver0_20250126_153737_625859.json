    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black, but I don't think race is a direct indicator here without more context on systemic issues or data from his area. So maybe low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That's not a lot to go on, so probably low impact.\n\nAge 19 with high school diploma\u2014usually, younger adults with less education might have lower reoffending rates if they're in stable situations, so this could be medium risk because he's still developing life skills.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to lack of supervision or support networks. So maybe medium weight here.\n\nHe has a history of substance use (marijuana) within the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, so high weight on that.\n\nHe's not depressed in the past month. Positive mental health might indicate better coping skills and less likely to engage in risky behaviors, so maybe this factor lowers his risk slightly, but since he uses drugs, it's still overall medium.\n\nYoung age with living with his biological mother\u2014could be part of a family environment, which is protective unless there are issues like neglect or abuse. Since the household size is 5 and urban area, might not directly affect much here, so maybe low weight.\n\nReligious involvement\u2014he believes in God. Religious factors can provide moral guidance and support, potentially reducing recidivism, so medium.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from drug use and living alone. Other factors like age and education are mitigating but don't outweigh the positives. So I'd assign a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Education\", \"medium\", \"He is 19 years old with a high school diploma, which typically correlates with lower reoffending rates compared to younger individuals without education or older adults with less educational attainment.
