    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I know there's some racial disparity in the criminal justice system, but at 22, he's still quite young and probably hasn't had much exposure to systemic issues yet. So maybe low risk here.\n\nHe has two prior convictions. That seems significant because more past offenses usually mean higher risk of reoffending. But since it's only two, I'm leaning towards medium risk from this factor alone.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 170 lbs. No info on BMI or if he's underweight or overweight, which sometimes correlates with substance abuse or health issues that could affect recidivism. So maybe no impact here; low risk factor.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014no ties to support him in times of need, but also not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. Probably medium risk because living alone can be isolating but doesn't directly relate to past crimes.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so maybe low or no impact from this factor. Unless he's not completing his education, which isn't stated here.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. That suggests some stability and ability to support himself, which usually reduces risk. So perhaps medium but more on the lower side because job count alone doesn't predict reoffending unless there are other negative factors.\n\nNo drug use in past four years, so that's a positive indicator. No recent substance abuse issues, which often contribute to recidivism. Low risk here.\n\nHe felt down for most of a month but nothing could cheer him up. Could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues. If it's a short-term problem, maybe no direct impact, but if it's ongoing, that would be concerning. I'm not sure how much this affects recidivism; perhaps medium risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both parents in an urban area at a young age\u2014high family support and living conditions usually are protective against recidivism. So low risk factor here.\n\nBelieves in God, which is a strong moral compass often associated with lower recidivism rates. That would be very protective; probably no high risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (medium), job stability (medium but maybe positive), education and employment (positive), no drug use (good), family background (good), personal beliefs (good). The negative factors are low or medium, but overall, I think the positive aspects outweigh. So maybe a 3-year prediction of NO rearrest with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have lower recidivism rates due to systemic factors that are less prevalent at this age.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two prior convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, but at 22 years old, this is not definitive for future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No BMI data provided; height and weight alone do not strongly correlate with recidivism without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress but does not directly indicate criminal liability.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma combined with college enrollment suggests good educational stability, which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Four jobs in a year indicates job stability and ability to support oneself, reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, indicating potential for low substance abuse risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Felt down for most of a month may indicate possible mental health issues but without duration or severity, it's unclear.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Household of five with both parents in urban areas suggests strong family support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is associated with higher moral compass and lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
