    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old Black female. She has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is Black. I remember that racial disparities in the criminal justice system are significant. There's evidence showing that Black individuals are often overrepresented in incarceration rates compared to their representation in the general population. So this could be a high risk factor.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That means she's already been locked up, which is a strong indicator of past behavior that might lead to future issues. High risk here.\n\nHer age is 20, which is relatively young but still early in her career. I'm not sure if the age factor increases or decreases risk at this point. Maybe lower risk? But she has other factors like drug use and living alone that might compensate for her age. So maybe medium to low.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 172 lbs, which is about average. Weight doesn't typically directly predict criminal behavior, but since she's Black, the racial factor might override this. So perhaps the weight isn't a high risk on its own.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating, which sometimes leads to substance abuse or mental health issues. Since she has a history of drug use (marijuana), maybe that ties into her living situation. But I'm not sure how strong this is as a standalone factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is in college. Education can correlate with lower recidivism, so having an education might actually reduce risk here. Maybe medium low.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the past year. That shows some stability and ability to support herself. Having multiple jobs could indicate good financial management and discipline, which are protective factors. So maybe this lowers her risk contribution.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a concern. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or other criminal acts. This seems like a high risk factor because it's ongoing.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but that doesn't necessarily mean she won't feel it again. Substance abuse and depression are often linked in predictive models for recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Racial factors and living environment can influence future criminal behavior due to exposure to certain influences or lack thereof. This might be another high risk factor because it's early in life and in a less supportive setting.\n\nPutting this all together: High due to race, high for prior arrest, medium-low for age but with other positive factors like education and job stability, high for drug use, and high for living in a less supportive environment. So overall prediction is high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Racial Disparities\", \"high\", \"Racial minority status (Black) is associated with higher rates of incarceration and recidivism due to systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending as past behavior can predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Age at 20\", \"low\", \"While age alone may not be a strong predictor, being younger could indicate higher motivation or potential for change, but other factors like substance use and living situation may mitigate this slightly.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation and substance abuse, which are risk factors, though it may not be as significant without concurrent issues like drug use.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college suggests some level of education and financial stability that may reduce recidivism risks compared to those with less education or no formal education.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs indicates employability and financial stability, which are protective factors against re-arrest compared to individuals with fewer job experiences or unstable employment histories.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a significant risk factor as substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or other criminal acts that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living in Rural Area at Age of 14\", \"high\", \"Early exposure in a rural household with limited support and resources may have contributed to substance abuse issues, which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
