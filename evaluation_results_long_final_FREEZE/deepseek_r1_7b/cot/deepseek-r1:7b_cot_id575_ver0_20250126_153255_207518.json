Generally, race can influence recidivism rates, but it's not a direct indicator. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That's a minor offense, so probably low risk compared to someone with a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes without any info on behavior or health issues.\n\nNot married and living alone\u2014unrelated to recidivism directly, but perhaps it affects his stability, which might be considered in other factors. Maybe medium? Wait, no\u2014the user didn't provide that factor, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Job stability often reduces recidivism because having steady employment can prevent future issues. So perhaps medium risk since he worked multiple jobs but maybe not very stable?\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression\u2014those are positive factors, so probably low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Being raised by family might offer support and stability, which could lower risk\u2014so medium or low? Maybe medium since it's a minor point compared to other factors.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't specify how that affects him personally. Maybe not directly related; so maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting all together: one arrest, education level, job history, no drug use\u2014all positive indicators. The only negative is the single arrest and living arrangement. But since it's a minor offense and he's relatively stable, I'd lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which may influence recidivism rates but not directly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"One arrest without a conviction suggests minor behavior issues rather than significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Employed in four positions within the past year indicates some stability and economic independence.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of substance stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban household of five suggests family support and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
