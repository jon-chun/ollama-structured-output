    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old Black female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her lack of convictions is a positive sign. She's only been arrested once, so that's one less point against her. But she has a history of drug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years. That could indicate substance abuse issues, which often correlates with criminal behavior or relapse. So maybe medium risk there.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently despite using drugs, but that might not directly relate to recidivism unless she's struggling mentally. Not sure how much weight to give that yet; perhaps low impact.\n\nHer background is concerning. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That could suggest instability or family dysfunction, which are risk factors for substance abuse and criminal behavior. That might be high risk.\n\nShe doesn't feel the influence of God recently. Religious factors can sometimes impact behavior, so this lack of spiritual connection could either positively or negatively affect her. I'm not sure about that yet; maybe medium.\n\nHer employment history is zero jobs in the past year. Unemployment for a year suggests she's not actively seeking help and might be experiencing barriers to reintegration. That's a high risk factor because she needs support but isn't getting it.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college, which could mean she's not prioritizing education or training that might reduce her risk of recidivism. High risk there as well since having a GED is better than no qualification, but not attending college shows possible disengagement.\n\nPutting this all together: one non-convict arrest (low), drug use (medium), unstable family background (high), lack of spiritual connection (medium), unemployment (high), and no college education (high). The high factors seem to outweigh the medium ones. I'd predict a high risk but with lower confidence since some factors are in play.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Non-Conviction Arrest\", \"low\", \"She has only one non-conviction arrest, which indicates she may not be a high risk for recidivism despite past incidents.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Her history of marijuana use could correlate with substance abuse issues that may influence criminal behavior or relapse.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living in an unstable household at a young age, particularly in an urban area, suggests potential family dysfunction and exposure to adverse environments which can increase risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Connection\", \"medium\", \"Her recent lack of spiritual connection might not directly impact her substance use but could influence mental health or personal stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"A year without employment indicates barriers to reintegration, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism as she may face challenges in accessing support systems and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a GED and not pursuing college shows disengagement from formal education, which could limit her ability to acquire necessary skills to avoid recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
