He's only been arrested once but not convicted, which is a good start because being arrested without a conviction might mean he's managed to avoid serious trouble yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so maybe I can skip that. He's never married and isn't living alone, which could be an issue if there are family issues or social support missing, but since he's 21, it might not be a big factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which is typical for someone his age. Not holding a job for a year doesn't necessarily indicate anything unless there was some job instability before, but I don't have info on that.\n\nNo recent drug use or depression over the past month is positive; it suggests he's mentally stable and maybe more likely to follow guidelines if given any supervision.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area could have its pros and cons. Urban areas might offer better resources, but having multiple family members could mean less individual support if something goes wrong. However, since he's considered under supervision by God, maybe that provides some moral guidance, which is positive.\n\nPutting this all together: no prior convictions, stable living situation with family, good mental health, and no drug use are all factors that would lower his risk. Since he's only 21, there might not be a lot of history of criminal behavior to predict future recidivism. So I'm leaning towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No prior conviction\", \"low\", \"His arrest is not severe and he has been released without a conviction, which suggests past behavior may not be indicative of long-term issues.\"),\n    (\"Stable living situation with family support\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of four provides some level of support and guidance, mitigating potential issues that might arise from living alone or being away from family.\"),\n    (\"Good mental health\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed recently and does not use drugs, indicating he is maintaining good mental well-being, which is a positive factor in risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and no college enrollment\", \"low\", \"His education level suggests he may have the skills to avoid further issues without additional academic support or challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
