    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history but it's expunged, so no prior convictions. That usually reduces risk compared to someone with a full record. But I don't think that's enough on its own.\n\nHer age is 21, which might mean she's relatively young and could still develop more habits or issues before being released. Maybe some factors are more significant in her case.\n\nShe uses marijuana, so drug use is present but not hard drugs. That might indicate she's been trying to change, but it's still an issue that can affect future behavior.\n\nShe felt down a lot recently, which could relate to mental health. High levels of stress or recent trauma might make her more prone to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six in a rural area at a young age suggests she experienced a lot of stress and possibly neglect. That environment can have long-term effects on her mental health and decision-making, which could lead to more substance use or criminal behavior later.\n\nShe identifies as God-negative, meaning she doesn't believe in a higher power. This might influence her coping mechanisms; maybe she deals with issues without seeking support, leading to isolation or risky choices.\n\nNo college education but high school diploma means she's not continuing her education, which could limit opportunities and contribute to staying in the criminal system if she's not motivated enough for better outcomes.\n\nLiving alone increases vulnerability to stressors like substance abuse triggers or unemployment. She has no job history, so she might be unemployed, making it harder to support herself healthily.\n\nPutting this all together: While her drug use is present but not severe, and her education level suggests some motivation, the factors pointing towards higher risk are living in a stressful household, recent trauma feelings, God-negative beliefs, and being in a vulnerable situation. These seem to stack up enough to suggest she's at moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Incarceration History\", \"low\", \"Her arrest is expunged, indicating no current criminal record which reduces recidivism risk compared to someone with a full conviction history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \" occasional drug use can impair judgment and contribute to relapse or new offenses. \"),\n    (\"Recent Emotional Low Point\", \"medium\", \" recent feelings of low mood may indicate ongoing mental health challenges that could affect decision-making and substance use. \"),\n    (\"Upbringing in a Household of 6 Rural Area\", \"high\", \" experiencing living with six family members in a rural area at a young age suggests exposure to stressors, neglect, and potentially unstable family dynamics which can lead to behavioral issues later in life. \"),\n    (\"God-negative Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"lack of religious support may influence her ability to cope with stress or seek help, increasing vulnerability to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. \"),\n    (\"Education Level (HS Diploma)\", \"low\", \" limited educational opportunities could present barriers to betterment and contribute to recidivism if motivation is low. \"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \" living alone increases susceptibility to stressors like substance use triggers, financial instability, or unemployment which can contribute to higher risk behaviors. \"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"low\", \" no job history suggests she may lack the means to support herself healthily and could be more vulnerable to substance abuse or other risky choices. \")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 230 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
