His weight is around 174 lbs, which might indicate some health issues but he's not been diagnosed as such yet.\n\nHe's single and living alone, so isolation could contribute to substance use or other behavioral issues. He has a GED and isn't in college, showing limited educational support which might affect future employability and stability.\n\nHe worked two jobs last year, but only used marijuana for drugs in the past four years. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is interesting because substance abuse often co-occurs with mood disorders.\n\nHis early life was spent in a household of four with his biological dad; that environment might have shaped his behavior without adequate support from family or other adults. His lack of religious belief could affect coping mechanisms and societal ties.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a history of substance abuse (marijuana use), limited education and employment, living alone due to singleness, and a past environment that didn't provide much support. These factors point towards a higher risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of eight arrests, indicating a significant criminal record which is a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and potential substance abuse or behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"limited_education\", \"medium\", \"Possession of a GED but not enrolled in college may indicate limited educational support and future employability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years, though not daily, could still contribute to behavioral instability.\"),\n    (\"past_environmental_problems\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological father in a household of four might have provided some level of stability but lacks broader support network.\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression despite substance use suggests mental health may not be a primary factor in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
