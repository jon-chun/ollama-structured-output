    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which might be a point against him since he's relatively young. But he has no prior convictions and only one arrest, so that's probably mitigating factors.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 145 lbs. That doesn't seem directly relevant to recidivism unless there's something about his weight or how it affects his ability to hold a job, but since he hasn't held any jobs, maybe not a big issue here.\n\nLiving alone is another point; living with family usually reduces risk of substance abuse issues, so that might be lower risk. But the fact that he never married and currently lives alone\u2014maybe indicating some independence, but I'm not sure how significant that is.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Some education can correlate with better job opportunities, which could reduce recidivism if he finds stable employment, but since he's not working now, maybe it doesn't help much.\n\nNot working during the year means he might have limited opportunities for positive engagement or learning from past mistakes. So that's a potential risk factor because lack of work can contribute to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nDrug use is zero in the past four years\u2014actually, he hasn't used any drugs, so that's good. No depressed feelings in the past month too; maybe better mental health overall. Positive indicators there.\n\nFrom his background: at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That might suggest exposure to certain environments or potential family issues, but without more info on that, it's hard to say if that increases risk.\n\nReligious belief\u2014he considers God involved in his life. Some people find comfort and guidance, which could prevent delinquency, so maybe lower risk from that standpoint.\n\nPutting all this together: low recidivism because he has no prior convictions, hasn't used drugs, is mentally stable, and living alone with a high school diploma. The factors don't point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe 21-year-old Black male has several mitigating factors that suggest a low risk of rearrest. His lack of prior convictions, recent positive drug use history, mental well-being, and independent living indicate stability. While his age is a consideration, the absence of significant negative factors points toward lower recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age of 21 might suggest he's still developing life skills and is less likely to engage in criminal behavior compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating a clean slate which can be a positive indicator for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, suggesting he is in a stable mental state which could prevent increased risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces the risk associated with potential family issues or substance abuse commonly linked to living environments with multiple household members.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While he has a high school diploma, not being enrolled in college may indicate limited opportunities for positive engagement which could be a moderate risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
