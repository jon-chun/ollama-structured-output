    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. I'll go through each factor step by step to determine the relative weight.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might indicate she's still developing skills, so lower risk compared to younger or older individuals.\nShe identifies as White, but race isn't typically a direct predictor of recidivism unless there are systemic issues involved. Since it's not specified, I'll consider it low weight.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction, which is moderate risk. Prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses.\nHeight at 5'4\" isn't directly relevant to recidivism but maybe if she's prone to falls or violence, but no such info here.\n\nLiving alone might suggest she's independent, so lower risk compared to those living with others who could offer support or safer environments.\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Educational attainment usually correlates with lower recidivism as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and stability.\nEmployed 4 jobs in a year \u2013 having multiple jobs can provide financial stability, so this factor might work against her risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be risky, but if she's not experiencing negative side effects now, maybe it's less severe.\nShe feels no depression recently despite past drug use, which could indicate she's managing well or perhaps using substances to cope with stress.\n\nYoung age of living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and less stability, increasing risk. Also, living with multiple family members could mean more supervision but also potential for abuse if not properly supervised.\n\nShe believes in God, which often correlates with good character or moral values, so this might lower her risk as she's likely to make responsible decisions.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (medium), drug use (low), urban living (high), lack of depression (low). High risk factors balance out the low ones. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old might indicate she is still developing skills and may have a lower chance of reoffending compared to younger or older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence outcomes, it's not directly predictive unless there are systemic issues involved, which aren't specified here.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and one conviction suggest a history of potential criminal behavior that could increase future risk.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"Her height isn't directly relevant to recidivism but may indicate physical stability depending on lifestyle factors not provided.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently pose a high risk, as it can offer independence and self-reliance which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and being in college indicates good educational attainments that often correlate with lower recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Employed 4 jobs in the past year suggests financial stability, which is generally protective against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years may pose some risk but not a high level if she hasn't experienced negative side effects recently.\"),\n    (\"Recent Depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month despite past drug use suggests good mental health and coping mechanisms.'),\n    (\"Urban Area Living at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area of household size 4 could indicate exposure to higher crime rates or less supervision, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may correlate with good character traits that reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
