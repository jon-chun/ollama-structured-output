    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has two arrests but no convictions. That means there are some past legal issues, which could indicate underlying problems that might make him more likely to reoffend. So that's a medium weight because it's not severe but still significant.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 195 lbs. I'm not sure how his size affects risk, so maybe this is low weight since body type isn't typically a big factor in recidivism unless there are other health issues involved here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That might suggest some social isolation or instability, which could increase the risk because he might lack support networks that help people stay out of trouble. So medium again, similar to the arrests.\n\nHaving a GED but not in college is interesting. Maybe he didn't value further education or found it difficult. This could point towards other areas of life where he's struggling, like job skills or social connections. Medium weight here too.\n\nNot working during the year means he might be underemployed or unemployed. That can lead to financial stress and other personal challenges that might contribute to criminal behavior. Medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine could have significant psychological impacts. The fact that he's not feeling depressed lately is a bit confusing because drug use often leads to mental health issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might reduce the risk slightly from drug use alone. Still, the history of drug use is medium weight.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of seven when young in an urban area. That's a tough start\u2014seven people living together can be chaotic and stressful. It could indicate family dysfunction or exposure to a high-stress environment that might affect his behavior. High risk factor because it's a significant negative influence.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from his past home situation likely has the most impact. The other factors are moderate but not as strong. So overall, I'd lean towards medium confidence in predicting rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Arrests (2 times)\", \"medium\", \"These arrests suggest potential underlying issues that may contribute to recidivism, though not severe enough to be high risk alone.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine in past 4 years)\", \"low\", \"The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently might mitigate the impact of drug use on his mental health, reducing it to a lower weight factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \" living alone can lead to social isolation and instability, which may increase risk slightly but not excessively high.\"),\n    (\"GED but not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Not being enrolled in college might indicate some focus on other areas of life, reducing the weight of this factor compared to severe educational barriers.\"),\n    (\"No job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment or underemployment can lead to financial stress and challenges that may contribute to criminal behavior, making it a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Household of 7 at young age in urban area\", \"high\", \"Living with seven people is likely chaotic and stressful, indicating family dysfunction which could have long-term behavioral impacts contributing significantly to high risk.\"),\n    (\"No depression felt in past month despite drug use history\", \"low\", \"The lack of recent depression symptoms may temper the negative impact of prior drug-related mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
