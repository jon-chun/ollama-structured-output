Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but I don't think race is a significant factor here beyond his personal statement about God not influencing his life, so maybe that's low weight.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and no conviction. That's a red flag because even if it's not a conviction, it still shows some past behavior issues. So that might be medium weight.\n\nHis weight is 6ft2 and 170 lbs\u2014tall and skinny\u2014but I'm not sure how height affects recidivism; maybe it's more about body fat or health issues? Maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's never married and currently not living alone, which could indicate instability. Unmarried individuals might face different pressures, so that could be medium weight.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college\u2014it shows he's actively trying to improve his education, but maybe not enough for long-term stability. Medium again.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year; that's good as employment can reduce recidivism, so low weight here.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor, especially if it's recent or linked to current issues. Medium weight because he might still be dealing with it without severe symptoms now.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That could expose him to certain environments\u2014maybe stressful or not conducive to positive outcomes. Medium weight.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life is significant. It shows lack of religious support, which can be associated with higher recidivism rates due to lack of guidance and community involvement. High weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest (medium), drug use (medium), living situation (medium), and lack of religious support (high). The GED isn't a strong positive either way. So the overall risk is moderate, but leaning towards high because of the strong factors like past drug use and unstable family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest which could indicate past behavior issues that might reoccur.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine could still be a risk factor, especially if it hasn't been addressed recently.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban household size 4 may provide some support but could also present stressors that might affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"high\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with his life is a significant risk factor, potentially indicating a lack of guidance and community involvement which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs during the year; consistent employment generally reduces recidivism risks but may not be sufficient for long-term stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
