They've been arrested once but not convicted, which might be a risk factor because even though it's just an arrest, it can lead to past mistakes affecting their future. Their height and weight don't seem relevant here.\n\nHe lives alone, so maybe that contributes to isolation or stress, which could increase recidivism. His lack of education is definitely a red flag; not having a diploma might make him more likely to fall into criminal activities again.\n\nHe's worked two jobs, but I'm not sure how that ties in yet. Drug use from the past four years, specifically marijuana, shows he has substance issues which are known predictors of recidivism. He didn't feel depressed recently, so maybe that's a mitigating factor or just personal stuff going on.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both parents at an urban area could have had a complex environment. Maybe that exposure led to some behavioral issues as he got older.\n\nHis religious beliefs don't seem directly related but might suggest he has strong moral values, which could be positive, but since he doesn't believe in God affecting his life personally, maybe that's a negative point because it can lead to lack of direction or responsibility.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor seems significant. The arrest history is low to medium risk, living alone adds medium, no education high, two jobs might not be enough so medium, drug use medium, lack of recent depression probably low but maybe a mitigator. Home environment could be low as he's an only child in a big family.\n\nSo overall, his recidivism risk seems high because several critical factors are present that point towards reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but no conviction, which may indicate a potential for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate is a significant risk factor associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs may indicate some ability to manage responsibilities but does not necessarily protect against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can be a predictor of future substance abuse and related risks.\"),\n    (\"Recent mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month may suggest better mental health, which could be a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of five with both biological parents suggests potential family dysfunction but does not directly correlate to high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Not feeling God's influence on personal life may indicate a lack of direction or purpose, potentially leading to increased risk of risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
