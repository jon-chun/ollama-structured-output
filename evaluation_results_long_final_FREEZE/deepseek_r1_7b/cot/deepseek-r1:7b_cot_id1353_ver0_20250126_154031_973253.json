    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can be more volatile because they're still developing their decision-making skills. That could mean higher recidivism rates, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and race can influence recidivism rates based on various socio-economic factors. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Re-arrest is a concern here because each arrest increases the chances of getting caught again if he tries to commit another crime. High risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 170 lbs, which don't seem directly relevant unless there's some health indicator I'm missing. Probably medium risk.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Unstable living situations can lead to substance abuse issues or other behavioral problems that might contribute to recidivism. Medium-high? Maybe high.\n\nNo college education but a GED. Having a high school diploma is generally associated with lower recidivism because it signals stability, so this might be low risk compared to someone without any education.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to lack of skills or motivation, which could increase risk if he doesn't get back into work. Medium-high, perhaps high.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can affect job performance and relationships, leading to higher recidivism. High risk.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can lead to dependency issues or emotional instability, increasing risk. High.\n\nBelieves in God. While spirituality might provide support, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. Maybe medium-low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high, high, high, high, medium-high, low, high, high, medium-low. Considering all factors, the prediction is YES with a confidence of 75%. He has multiple high-risk factors that significantly increase his likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are more volatile in decision-making, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Racial background can influence socio-economic factors linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests without convictions raise the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"medium\", \"No direct relevance in this context.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Unstable living conditions may lead to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"GED indicates some stability, though not as strong as a college diploma.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \" unemployment can signal lack of motivation or skills.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use/Recent Mood\", \"high\", \" Drug use and mood issues are significant contributors to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"high\", \" Experience in a household of three in rural areas may indicate dependency issues.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"medium-low\", \" Belief in God does not directly correlate with criminal behavior but may indicate support for substance abuse issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
