    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. Generally, race doesn't directly predict recidivism, but it's part of the background that might influence other factors like access to resources or community support. So maybe a low impact here.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and a conviction. That's significant because having a criminal history increases the chance of getting into trouble again. So high weight on prior convictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches, weighs between 175-199 lbs. I don't see how physical characteristics directly affect recidivism unless there's something about his health or living situation, which isn't mentioned here. So low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living arrangements can be linked to higher risk because he might not have support from family or friends, which could affect his ability to get help if needed. Medium weight here because it's a factor but not as strong as some others.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Education is a big deal in recidivism studies; lack of education often correlates with lower educational aspirations and higher risk of engaging in risky behavior. High weight on low educational attainment.\n\nNot enrolled in college, which reinforces the idea that he might be less likely to seek further education and maybe engage in other negative activities. High weight here too.\n\nOnly held one job during the year. Jobless status can lead to dependency issues or lack of skills that might help him reintegrate into society successfully. Medium to high? Since holding a job is positive, not having it could be moderately risky but maybe not as high as say employment history.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can have multiple effects: it can impede cognitive functions, increase risk-taking behaviors, and potentially lead to more serious crimes if used under influence. High weight here because drug use is a direct risk factor.\n\nFeeling down most of the time could be a sign of underlying mental health issues or substance abuse. This might contribute to self-harm or other risky behaviors. High weight on feeling low/miserable.\n\nLiving at 18 in a rural area with his mother and four siblings, which was an abuse household. That's a red flag for abuse and neglect, which can have long-term psychological effects. High weight because child abuse history is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nBelieves God has some role in his life. While this could be a protective factor against materialism or gambling, it might also indicate other underlying issues if he's struggling mentally or spiritually. Medium to low impact here as it's more about belief than behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), living circumstances with abuse (high). The rest are moderate. So the total risk is likely high.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several significant risk factors, particularly prior criminal history and drug use, which point to a high likelihood of recidivism within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Having one prior arrest and conviction significantly increases the risk of reoffending as past behavior often predicts future actions.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can impede cognitive functions and increase risky behaviors that may lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"abuse_history\", \"high\", \"Living in a neglectful household with a history of abuse is strongly associated with higher rates of recidivism due to potential psychological trauma and strained relationships which can contribute to risky decision-making or self-harm behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
