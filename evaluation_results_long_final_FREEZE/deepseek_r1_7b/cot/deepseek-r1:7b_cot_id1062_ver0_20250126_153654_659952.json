    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old Black male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a single arrest but no conviction. That might be significant because even if it's not a severe offense, it could indicate past behavior that might recur.\n\nHis height and weight are average, which doesn't immediately raise concerns unless there's an associated health issue, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or substance use, but since he's not currently using drugs as per the data, this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nHigh school diploma means he has some education, which could imply responsible behavior. Not college enrollment suggests maybe he's more self-reliant now than in the past.\n\nHe held one job last year, which is decent stability. Unemployment for longer periods can lead to behavioral issues or substance use again.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse often correlates with recidivism, especially if it's frequent or severe. However, his current mood isn't mentioned as depressed, which could be a positive sign.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area might suggest he has family support, but urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates and different dynamics that might affect his behavior.\n\nConsidering God's influence on his life adds a personal aspect. If he believes in a higher power, it might prompt him to seek betterment or change, which could be beneficial.\n\nPutting all these together: His drug use past is a red flag but doesn't necessarily mean he'll relapse immediately. The lack of conviction and living alone are mitigators. The rest don't point towards high risk. So I'd rate his overall risk as medium because there's room for improvement, especially regarding substance use patterns.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n1. **Drug Use History**: Medium - The individual has a history of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, which is a significant risk factor but not necessarily indicative of immediate recidivism.\n\n2. **Arrest Record**: Low - A single non-convicted arrest may indicate previous behavior that could potentially recur, but it does not directly correlate with high levels of risk without further evidence.\n\n3. Living Alone: Medium - Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, though this factor is mitigated by the individual's current substance use status and lack of depression over the past month.\n\n4. Education Level: Low - Having a high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates but may indicate some level of responsibility.\n\n5. Employment: Medium - Employing one job last year suggests a stable income, which can contribute to lower risk behaviors compared to those unemployed or under employability stress.\n\n6. Family History: Low - Living with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age could suggest family support but may also be influenced by the broader social context of urban environments.\n\n7. Religious Beliefs: Medium - Believing that God has influence over his life can provide motivation for positive behavior, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the overall risk is low to medium due to mitigating factors such as stable employment, family support, and some positive influences from religious beliefs. However, there are concerning elements like a drug use history that require attention but do not necessarily point towards high risk without further evidence of relapse or increased problematic behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, which is a significant risk factor but not necessarily indicative of immediate recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"A single non-convicted arrest may indicate previous behavior that could potentially recur, but it does not directly correlate with high levels of risk without further evidence.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, though this factor is mitigated by the individual's current substance use status and lack of depression over the past month.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates but may indicate some level of responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employing one job last year suggests a stable income, which can contribute to lower risk behaviors compared to those unemployed or under employability stress.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age could suggest family support but may also be influenced by the broader social context of urban environments.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has influence over his life can provide motivation for positive behavior, potentially reducing recidivism risk but may vary based on personal circumstances and environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
