    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the recidivism risk for a 22-year-old female named Maria. She's white, has one arrest but no conviction, is 5'3\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs, not married, living with someone who isn't alone. She has a GED, isn't in college, held four jobs, hasn't used drugs for four years, felt down sometimes, lived with her mom in a household of three urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Arrests**: She has one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad since she could be working on getting out of cuffs. But having an arrest still raises the risk compared to someone with no record.\n\n2. **GED**: Having a GED can sometimes lead people into further trouble, as education gaps often correlate with lower educational attainment and higher recidivism rates.\n\n3. **Job History**: Four jobs in a year isn't bad, but it also might indicate she's somewhat stable or trying to find better opportunities. Not being employed full-time could be a risk factor if she's not gaining the necessary skills or facing barriers.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: No use for four years is positive. Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues that might contribute to recidivism, but since she's clean, that reduces some risk factors.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: She felt down recently and sometimes so bad she couldn't cheer herself up. Mental health issues are a known factor in recidivism. If she's struggling with mood or has underlying mental health conditions, it could increase her chances of reoffending.\n\n6. **Family History**: Living with her biological mother in a household of three urban area might have some social factors at play. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or stressors that might contribute to recidivism if she's not getting support.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: While religious beliefs are generally protective, some individuals' faiths may not provide the same level of support as other factors like family or community resources.\n\nPutting it all together: She has no prior convictions but one arrest; her GED might be a risk factor; she's jobless for part of the year which could indicate she's not finding stable employment. Her recent mental health issues add another layer, and living in an urban environment with a struggling family situation. While some factors are mitigating (like drug use), others point towards higher risk.\n\nConsidering all these, her risk is likely on the medium side but leaning towards high because of the combination of factors like family situation, potential mental health issues, lack of stable employment despite having a job history, and no prior convictions which might indicate she's trying to turn her life around.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest without conviction, indicating potential instability but not a significant risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"GED\", \"low\", \"Her GED could be protective as education often correlates with better outcomes, though it might also present gaps leading to future issues.\")\n    ,\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Having four jobs suggests some attempt at stability, which is mitigating but not entirely positive given the context of her circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No use in four years reduces risk factors associated with substance abuse that often contribute to recidivism.\")\n    ,\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression and inability to cope suggest a higher risk of re-engaging in negative behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with her mother in an urban household of three may introduce social challenges without adequate support, raising the risk slightly.\")\n    ,\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While her religious faith is a positive factor, it might not address the systemic issues contributing to her current situation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
