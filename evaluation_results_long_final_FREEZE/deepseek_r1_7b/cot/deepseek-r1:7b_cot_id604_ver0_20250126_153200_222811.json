    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 22-year-old male. Let me break down each factor to determine their weight.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest but no conviction. That's a minor offense, so maybe it's low impact. He\u2019s also got a GED and isn\u2019t in college, which might indicate lower motivation or support system\u2014another low factor.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight 202 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics alone are significant here unless there's an issue with substance use, but since he only used marijuana, maybe that's not a big deal yet.\n\nLiving alone suggests no immediate support network, which could be medium risk because isolation might lead to stress or other issues.\n\nHe has two job experiences. Having some work history can help prevent further delinquency, so this is probably low.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014just marijuana\u2014isn't a major red flag yet, but he felt down recently. That emotional distress could be a medium factor as it might correlate with substance issues or stressors affecting his behavior.\n\nAt a young age, living with ten people for ten years sounds unusual and stressful. That's likely high risk because chronic stress can lead to behavioral problems later on.\n\nHis belief in God is positive but doesn't directly relate to risk factors, so I'll note it as low.\n\nPutting this all together: high risk from the extensive family environment, medium due to recent emotional distress, and other low factors. The overall prediction leans towards high recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"The individual has one arrest but no conviction, indicating minimal prior involvement in the legal system which may suggest low re-offending risk without further factors.\",\n    (\"ged and education\", \"low\", \"Possession of a GED and lack of college enrollment indicate some level of education attainment but also possible lack of motivation or support for further education which could influence recidivism risk.\",\n    (\"job history\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs during the year suggests a stable income source and potential for better economic opportunities, which may reduce re-offending risk despite other factors.\",\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years with recent feelings of low mood may indicate mild substance use issues which could be addressed with appropriate support but not directly linked to high recidivism risk yet.\",\n    (\"family environment\", \"high\", \"Living with ten people at a young age and considering God as a factor indicates significant family stress or dysfunction which is strongly associated with higher re-offending risk due to potential behavioral issues rooted in chronic stress or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Emotional distress\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying stressors or mental health issues which may influence substance use, employment, and other factors contributing to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 202 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
