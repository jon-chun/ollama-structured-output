    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. He's been arrested six times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of past issues. His height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about his personal circumstances.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which might mean he's less stable. His GED and not going to college could affect his employability in the future. He hasn't held any jobs during the year either, so no work history. That's a red flag because having a job can help with financial stability and support.\n\nHe used drugs for the past four years and recently felt really down. Maybe he's struggling mentally, which could influence his behavior. His early life was in an urban household of four with non-biological parents. That environment might have had both positive and negative impacts on him; I wonder if it contributed to his criminal history or present issues.\n\nHe believes in God, so he has a strong moral framework. That might help, but his other factors are more concerning. \n\nPutting this all together, the high number of prior convictions (6) is a major factor. His lack of job experience and living situation also add to the risk. The drug use and emotional distress could exacerbate any underlying issues. So I'm leaning towards a high relative weight for these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with 6 prior arrests and convictions, indicating past behavior that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a stable environment or support network could increase stress and dependency issues which may influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Not having a GED and not enrolling in college can affect job prospects and financial stability, potentially leading to unstable living conditions and increased risk of involvement in the criminal justice system again.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"No employment during the past year suggests difficulty obtaining stable income or support, which can contribute to substance abuse and other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent heavy use in the past month, may indicate ongoing substance abuse issues that could lead to more risk-taking behavior and legal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for extended periods without professional intervention or support may suggest untreated mental health issues that could contribute to criminal behavior or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Early Childhood Environment\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of four with non-biological parents, despite living in an urban area, may have had both positive and negative influences on the individual's current behavior and recidivism risk but is not a primary factor compared to other factors like prior convictions or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Having a strong belief in God may provide some level of moral guidance and support against criminal behavior, which could somewhat mitigate recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
