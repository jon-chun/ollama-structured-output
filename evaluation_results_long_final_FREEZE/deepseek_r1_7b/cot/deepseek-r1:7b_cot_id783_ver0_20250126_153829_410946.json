    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this individual for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which might indicate she's still developing skills like working and making responsible decisions. She has a White identifying, but race alone doesn't directly predict recidivism unless there are systemic issues in the area.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. While this isn't a huge number, it does suggest past criminal behavior that could impact future decisions.\n\nHeight is 5'4\" and weight is 115 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out as problematic here, but being underweight might affect self-control or health issues indirectly.\n\nMarried and living alone: Being in a relationship can provide support, while living alone doesn't inherently increase risk unless she's struggling with it. She isn't in a shared housing situation which could mean less supervision.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college indicates low educational attainment, which is linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for positive skills development.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year\u2014employment itself can be positive, but if she's unemployed or underemployed, it might affect her ability to support herself or make sound decisions.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor as it impairs judgment, increases crime rates, and can lead to relapse. However, since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe there's some improvement, but that's speculative.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with her biological mother in a household of five: Being in a large family from an early age might indicate growing up in a challenging environment without proper support or supervision, which can contribute to risk-taking behaviors.\n\nBelieving God has nothing to do with her life\u2014this lack of religious support could mean she lacks accountability and might engage in riskier decisions without guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use is the most concerning factor. Her low educational attainment adds to her vulnerabilities. Having lived in a large family from a young age may contribute to unstable home environments, which can lead to substance abuse or criminal behavior. While she's married and living alone, not having a support network could amplify her risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014especially drug use and low education\u2014it seems like the risk is on the higher side but maybe not certain. However, given that she has one prior conviction and no high school diploma, I might lean towards a medium to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 20 may indicate limited life experience which could affect her ability to make sound decisions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED may impede her ability to secure employment or contribute positively to society.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with a stable marital situation might provide some level of support, though it doesn't guarantee safety.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living in a household of five from a young age could indicate past challenges that may influence current behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Her lack of religious belief might not directly correlate with risk-taking behaviors but can affect personal accountability.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
