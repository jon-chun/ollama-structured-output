    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two prior convictions. That seems pretty significant because past convictions are a strong indicator of future behavior. So that would be high risk.\n\nNext, his education level\u2014he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Without proper education, especially in today's job market, he might struggle to find stable employment, which could contribute to substance abuse or other negative behaviors. That's another high factor.\n\nHe lives alone, hasn't been married, and has no children. Living alone can be isolating, which might lead him to turn to substances as a coping mechanism. This isolation is another medium-high risk factor.\n\nHis drug use history\u2014using marijuana in the past four years and sometimes in the last month\u2014is concerning. Drug use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and may lead to further involvement in the criminal system or substance abuse issues. That's definitely high.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. This suggests he was raised in a possibly stressful environment, which could have long-term effects on his mental health and ability to form stable relationships. This is medium-high risk.\n\nHis belief in God might be seen as positive, but sometimes religious beliefs can also lead to risky behaviors if they interfere with substance use or decision-making. So that's another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple factors\u2014criminal history, lack of education, living situation, drug use\u2014all point towards a high risk of rearrest. I'm pretty confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior convictions which indicates past criminal behavior and potential for future criminality.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests possible difficulty in obtaining future employment opportunities, increasing the risk of involvement in substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation which may result in substance use as a coping mechanism and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in past four years, with recent use noted, suggests potential for continued substance abuse issues which can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents at a young age in an urban area may indicate exposure to stressful environments that could impact mental health and long-term stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
