    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this person based on the factors given. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that lowers the risk compared to someone older who has a history of convictions.\n\nRace: he identifies as Black. Generally, there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can affect Black individuals more than others, so this could be a factor pointing towards higher risk.\n\nArrests and convictions: He's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some past behavior without serious consequences, which is concerning but maybe not as severe as having a conviction. However, being arrested still shows vulnerability.\n\nHeight and weight: 6ft 0in (182cm) and 165 lbs. I don't know if that relates to recidivism directly, so perhaps this factor isn't very significant here.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues that could increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but enrolled in college. Some people find it hard to stay in school after being released from prison, which could mean unstable living situations or lack of support for reintegration.\n\nNumber of jobs: He's held 3 jobs in a year. That seems stable; having multiple jobs usually leads to better economic stability and less time spent on welfare, reducing the chance of engaging in criminal activities again.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in the past four years. That\u2019s a positive sign. If someone isn\u2019t using drugs, it might indicate self-control or recent intervention, which could lower recidivism risk.\n\nMood: He feels down sometimes for an extended period. This could be linked to mental health issues like depression, which is a known risk factor for substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nUpbringing: At a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. High family dynamics can have mixed effects\u2014good if there's support but could also lead to instability if things fell apart. Urban areas might have better resources or higher stress which isn't directly helpful here.\n\nReligion: He believes God has something to do with his life. While some factors like religious involvement are considered positive, others might find it a barrier to seeking help, which could be a risk factor depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together, I think there's a mix of both positive and negative factors. The arrest alone isn't a huge red flag if it wasn't for conviction, but his living situation and recent family history are concerning. His mood and religion might not directly impact recidivism as much as other factors like family support or substance use.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards a medium risk because while there are some positive signs (education, job stability, no drug use), there are also significant concerns from his arrest, family environment, and mood swings that could lead to further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to developmental stages.
