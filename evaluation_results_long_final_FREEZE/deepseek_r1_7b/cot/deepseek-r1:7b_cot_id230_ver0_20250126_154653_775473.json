I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like education or substance use here.\n\nHe has two prior convictions. That seems like a red flag because having a history of criminal behavior can increase the chance he might do it again.\n\nHis age is 22, which is relatively young but still early adulthood. Young adults sometimes have more motivation and less recrimination compared to older adults, so maybe that's not as high a risk factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living with family can provide support, but being alone might limit opportunities for positive interactions or getting involved in community programs.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college suggests he has some education background, which might be protective against recidivism compared to those without any formal education.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Unemployment is a risk factor, but having at least one job shows he's employed somewhere, so that might lower his risk a bit.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) could be problematic. Substance abuse can affect judgment, relationships, and career prospects, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might indicate some level of mental health, but if he's been struggling before, that could still be a risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his parents at age young suggests exposure to various social influences, which can impact his behavior and decision-making.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with his personal life adds a layer of complexity. It might indicate a strong moral compass or some form of religious involvement that could either help or complicate efforts to assess risk accurately.\n\nPutting all these factors together: two prior convictions are significant, drug use is concerning, unemployment despite attending college and having a job\u2014though maybe that's not enough to offset the other negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two prior convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.
