    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has one arrest but no conviction. That means he might still be eligible for probation or community service, which usually leads to lower recidivism rates compared to those with convictions. So that's a low risk here.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 190 lbs. Weight can influence behavior; however, without knowing his BMI or how he maintains this weight, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe it's not directly relevant unless there are other factors like health issues.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone is generally associated with lower risk of family support which might help him stay out of trouble. But that depends on the circumstances, so I can't assign a high risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma but enrolled in college. Education usually reduces recidivism because it provides opportunities and better life goals. So this should be low risk.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Employment is positive as it offers stability and financial independence, which lowers the chance of engaging in criminal activities. Low risk again.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine but hasn't felt depressed recently. drug use can have both short-term and long-term effects on behavior. The recent lack of depression might indicate he's managed his substance use well, so maybe low risk, though it's still a factor to consider.\n\nLiving with four parents at a young age in an urban area. Being raised by multiple family members could provide more supervision and stability. This is actually a positive sign for low risk.\n\nHis religious belief that God has influence over his life: religious factors can sometimes lead to better decision-making or moral support, which might reduce recidivism. So this should be considered as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards lower risk with some minor considerations about drug use and employment history not being strong. The overall prediction is NO for rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one arrest without a conviction, which typically indicates potential for positive outcomes as they may qualify for rehabilitative services or probation.
