    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm trying to assess the risk of a 22-year-old Black female with rearrest recidivism over three years. She has two arrests but no convictions. She's 5'7\", living alone without a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. No job experience last year. She used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived with her biological mother at age two, and believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each factor:\n\n1. **Arrests**: Two arrests but no convictions. I know that arrests don't always lead to convictions, so maybe this isn't as significant as if she were convicted. However, even without a conviction, having two arrests could indicate prior trouble which might correlate with future issues.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can sometimes lead to more serious offenses or contribute to recidivism, but since it's only marijuana and not something like alcohol or other substances, maybe the risk isn't as high as if she was using harder drugs.\n\n3. **Living Alone**: Living alone can be isolating and might lead to issues with mental health or substance abuse. But without more info on her mental health or living situation, it's hard to gauge exactly how much of a factor that is.\n\n4. **Education Level**: She has no high school diploma or GED. Lack of education can increase the risk of entering the criminal justice system again, maybe for lower-level offenses.\n\n5. **No Job Experience**: Not working could lead to dependency issues, which might contribute to recidivism. But it's not always a direct indicator; sometimes people take on low-level work without issues.\n\n6. **Religious Belief**: She believes God is involved in her life. Some religious beliefs can provide a sense of direction or purpose, but others might be more about control or avoidance. It doesn't directly correlate with recidivism as strongly as other factors.\n\n7. **Past Experience Living with Biological Mother**: At age two, she lived with her mother. This could suggest a stable early environment which is generally protective against recidivism, so maybe this factor lowers the risk slightly.\n\nPutting it all together: The main factors that stand out are the lack of education and employment history, plus past drug use. These seem to be more directly related to reoffending than her two arrests or living alone. The positive aspect from growing up with a biological mother might somewhat mitigate some risk, but given the other negative factors, I'm leaning towards a higher risk.\n\nSo, weighing each factor: Education and employment are high risk because they're barriers to better opportunities which can help reduce recidivism. Drug use is medium since it's recent but not severe. The past experience with her mother is low as it's protective. The rest might be lower or no impact. So overall, considering the negative factors, there's a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the risk factors and their respective weights:\n\n1. **Lack of Education**: High - Lack of education can increase the risk of reoffending by limiting opportunities for positive development.\n2. **Drug Use (Marijuana)**: Medium - Recent marijuana use may correlate with past behavior but doesn't necessarily indicate severe substance abuse.\n3. **Employment History**: Low to Medium - Not working could lead to dependency issues, contributing to recidivism.\n\nConsidering the factors and their weights, there is a higher risk of rearrest due to the negative impact of lack of education and employment history, despite some protective elements from early life experiences. The prediction leans towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can increase the risk of reoffending by limiting opportunities for positive development and reducing chances of obtaining better employment prospects which may deter recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years could indicate prior substance use, though it does not necessarily correlate with severe substance abuse or direct involvement in criminal activity beyond the initial arrest\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\"|\"medium\", \"Not working during the year may lead to dependency issues and lower self-sufficiency, which can increase the risk of engaging in similar behaviors leading to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
