    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills and may not have established habits that contribute to reoffending.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic, which can be a risk factor due to higher crime rates in some areas, though this varies widely by location. Since she hasn't been convicted yet but has been arrested once, her criminal history is present, albeit not final. The nature of her offense isn't specified, so I have to consider that future offenses could follow similar patterns.\n\nShe's 5 feet 1 inch; height alone doesn't predict risk significantly, but combined with other factors like living situation and employment status, it might play a role.\n\nLiving alone is another point in her favor. Single adults are often less likely to reoffend compared to those living with others, possibly due to higher social support or fewer immediate connections who could influence her decisions.\n\nHer lack of college enrollment might mean she hasn't developed life skills necessary for stablement. Alternatively, if she's working, that could be a positive sign.\n\nShe has three jobs in the past year\u2014this suggests some financial stability and ability to support herself, which is protective against re-arrest.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years shows good substance abuse habits, which is a strong indicator of lower risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month indicates she's mentally stable. This is another protective factor as mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHer early life living with both parents at a household size of six in an urban area suggests she might have been exposed to various influences that could potentially impact her decision-making later on, though this varies based on the environment and support networks.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her personal events. This lack of religious guidance might mean she doesn't turn to religion for coping with stress or making decisions, which can sometimes lead to impulsive behaviors if not balanced by other support systems.\n\nPutting all these together: She's young but has a clean enough record, living alone is positive, good employment history, no drug use, and mental stability. The factors that could still increase risk are her Hispanic background (which I might have misjudged initially) and her early environment. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, the potential for re-arrest within three years isn't extremely high.\n\nI think there's a medium to low relative weight here. She has several protective factors that should lower the risk, but some background variables could temper that slightly. Given all this, I would predict a NO for rearrest with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills and habits.\"),\n    (\"Hispanic Background\", \"medium\", \"Higher crime rates in some areas, though varies by location and individual circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Positive indicator of social support and reduced risk of reoffending compared to living with others.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Three jobs suggest financial stability and ability to support herself, reducing re-arrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No use in the past four years indicates good substance abuse habits as a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed suggests stable mental state, another protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with six family members in an urban area might expose her to various influences that could impact decision-making later on.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing God has no role indicates lack of potential religious guidance for coping or decision-making, which can sometimes lead to impulsive behaviors if not balanced by other support systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
