His weight and height don't seem directly related to recidivism but might be noted as indicators of potential substance use if he's overweight.\n\nHe's living alone without a high school diploma or GED, which could mean limited opportunities for reintegration into society. His job history shows minimal employment during the year, possibly indicating unstable financial status or lack of skills.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is concerning\u2014specifically marijuana. Even if he hasn't felt depressed recently, drug use can lead to further issues and might affect his mental state when making decisions.\n\nHis background living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area could hint at potential family dynamics or exposure to socioeconomic factors that might influence his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past convictions, education level, job history, substance use, and family background\u2014it's clear he has multiple risk indicators. These points collectively suggest a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior criminal convictions, which is a significant indicator of past behavior that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which limits his ability to secure stable employment and further education opportunities.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"He has held only two jobs during the past year, indicating limited income stability and potential exposure to financial stress that may contribute to risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which can lead to altered decision-making and increased risk of criminal behavior if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of four suggests potential family dynamics or exposure to socioeconomic factors that may influence his behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"past_mood_state\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, but this does not directly correlate with recidivism risk compared to other factors like substance use or prior convictions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
