    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to each risk factor for this 20-year-old male. Then, using those weights, predict his rearrest recidivism over three years with a prediction (YES or NO) and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let me list all the factors provided:\n\n1. Age: 20\n2._race: White\n3. Arrests: 2 times, not convicted\n4. Height: 6'1\", weight 180 lbs\n5. Marital status: Never married\n6. Currently living alone\n7. Education: High school diploma, not in college\n8. Employment history: 1 job during the year\n9. Drug use: No drugs past four years\n10. Depression: Not felt in past month\n11. Family background: At young age lived with both parents in a household of 4 in an urban area\n12. Beliefs: Considers God has influence\n\nNow, I'll analyze each factor's potential impact on recidivism.\n\n1. **Age (20):** Generally, younger individuals may have less life experience and higher risk of reoffending due to impulsive decisions or lack of maturity. However, 20 is a young age with many opportunities ahead, so maybe low weight.\n\n2. **Race (White):** Race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors like policing bias or socioeconomic disparities. White individuals may have lower recidivism rates on average but it's still a factor that could contribute moderately. Medium weight.\n\n3. **Arrests (2 times, not convicted):** Two arrests are significant but not convictions. If the crimes were minor, this might be low risk. However, if they were serious, it could increase risk. Since it's not specified as convicted, maybe medium because two arrests can still signal prior involvement.\n\n4. **Height and weight (6'1\"/180 lbs):** Physical characteristics like height are less likely to directly impact recidivism unless there's a history of physical violence or if weight is a concern for substance abuse. Here, no info on that, so maybe low weight.\n\n5. **Marital status (single):** Being single can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to lack of support and potential issues in relationships which could impact substance use or mental health. Medium weight.\n\n6. **Living alone:** Living alone is a known risk factor for recidivism because isolation increases vulnerability to stressors, substance abuse, or domestic violence. High weight here since living alone is a strong indicator.\n\n7. **Education (high school diploma):** Holding a high school diploma may correlate with lower recidivism as education can provide skills and opportunities reducing future criminality. Low weight.\n\n8. **Employment history (1 job):** One job during the year might indicate employability, which could reduce risk. However, if not actively employed or has unstable employment, it's a bit of a mixed signal. Maybe low to medium weight.\n\n9. **Drug use (none in past four years):** No drug use is positive and reduces risk factors associated with substance abuse. High weight here.\n\n10. **Depression (not felt in past month):** Not feeling depressed might suggest better mental health, reducing recidivism risk. High weight.\n\n11. **Family background:** Lived with both parents in a household of four urban area at young age. Being raised in such a close environment could have protective factors but may also expose to stressors. However, it's an urban setting which might be more stressful. Medium weight.\n\n12. **Beliefs (consider God influential):** Religious beliefs can influence behavior and decision-making. If they believe in God influencing decisions, this might provide some protective factor against risk-taking behaviors. Medium weight.\n\nNow, considering each factor with their weights:\n\n- Age: low\n- Race: medium\n- Arrests: medium\n- Height/weight: low\n- Marital status: medium\n- Living alone: high\n- Education: low\n- Employment: low to medium (let's say medium)\n- Drug use: high\n- Depression: high\n- Family background: medium\n- Beliefs: medium\n\nTotal risk factors are those that point towards higher likelihood. Factors like living alone, no drug use, and positive mental health contribute significantly. However, being White could imply certain systemic risks despite the absence of convictions.\n\nCombining these, I think there's a moderate to high risk. But considering all factors, it might lean towards medium but with some high indicators. Maybe overall prediction is NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age may increase impulsive decisions and reduce life experience, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors; White individuals generally have lower rates but not always consistently.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions could signal prior involvement in criminal activity, contributing to higher risk estimates.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant information on past substance abuse or violent behavior affecting this individual's risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase vulnerability to stressors and potential issues related to mental health and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone significantly increases vulnerability to stress, domestic violence, and substance abuse, making it a strong indicator of high risk.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma provides basic skills but may not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk without further education or training opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"One job during the year might indicate employability, which could reduce risk if stable and beneficial; however, uncertainty in employment could increase risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in past four years is a strong positive indicator of reduced risk associated with substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depression for the past month suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk associated with mental distress issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Raised in a close household could have both protective and potentially stressful factors, but the urban setting may contribute to higher stress levels.\"),\n    (\"Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs influencing decision-making can provide some protective factors against impulsive or risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
