    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black individual with two prior arrests and a conviction. Recidivism often has a racial component, so that's a high risk right there because being Black can put him at higher odds compared to his White peers.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 175-199 lbs, which is within the normal range for his age. Maybe he's healthy, but weight isn't always a direct indicator of recidivism risk. So that factor might be low or medium, not sure yet.\n\nLiving alone with no spouse indicates he doesn't have family support, which can contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors. That could be a medium-high risk because isolation often leads to substance abuse.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Lack of employment is a red flag. Without income, he might turn to illegal activities or further engage in risky behavior if he has unfinished education. So this factor should be high.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana adds another layer. Substance abuse can increase criminal activity and impulsive behavior, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might suggest some level of mental health issues, but if he's not feeling it now, maybe he hasn't sought help recently. However, substance abuse can sometimes coexist with depression, so this one could be medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nHe was raised in a household of five by his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a larger household might lead to neglect if not properly supervised. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more stressors, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nConsidering that he believes God has some role in his life, it suggests he's religious but doesn't necessarily correlate with lower recidivism. It could be a neutral factor unless there are other supportive influences from his faith community.\n\nPutting all these together: prior convictions (high), isolation (medium-high), lack of employment (high), drug use (high), growing up in an environment that might be stressful or unsupervised (high). The racial background also adds to the risk. So I think overall, this person's risk is high for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having a history of prior arrests and convictions can significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending, especially considering racial factors which may influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone without a spouse may lead to isolation, potentially increasing substance abuse and risky behaviors that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Not having held a job in the past year could indicate unstable financial situations or substance abuse, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, particularly marijuana, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors and seeking illegal substances, all of which contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of five with no spouse may indicate potential neglect or exposure to urban stressors that could influence substance abuse and impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not inherently lower risk but may correlate with seeking help, though this factor alone is neutral.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
