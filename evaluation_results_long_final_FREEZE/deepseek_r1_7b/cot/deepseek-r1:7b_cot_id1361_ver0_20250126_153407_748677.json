He's been arrested twice but not convicted, which might indicate past behavior issues without formal consequences. His height and weight don't really factor in here; it's more about his other factors.\n\nHe's living alone, so maybe he doesn't have support, which could increase chances of making bad decisions again. No high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete education, possibly leading to unstable life choices.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently single, which might mean he's focusing on himself without relationships as a source of stability. His drug use history\u2014marijuana in the past four years\u2014he's using drugs regularly now, which can have negative effects on his ability to function and connect with others.\n\nMostly feeling down makes me think he's not in a good mental state. Maybe struggling with emotional issues that could lead to impulsive or harmful behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of seven kids in an urban area\u2014sounds chaotic. That environment might have left him with behavioral issues or a lack of positive role models, which are risk factors for reoffending.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past criminal history (arrests), living alone, lack of education, substance use, emotional struggles, and a tough up upbringing\u2014all point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating past behavior issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can reduce support and stability, which might slightly increase risk but is mitigated by other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED significantly impacts an individual's ability to make stable life choices and could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use history, particularly marijuana, can impair judgment and social interactions, increasing the risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Struggles\", \"high\", \"Feeling down most of the time suggests mental health issues that may lead to impulsive or harmful decisions.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of seven children in an urban area likely exposed him to negative influences and behavioral patterns that could contribute to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
