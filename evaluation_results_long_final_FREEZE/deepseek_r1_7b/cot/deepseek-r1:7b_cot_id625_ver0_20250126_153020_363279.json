    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who's asked for a risk assessment analysis. They provided detailed information about a 19-year-old male with several factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals might have more potential for positive change, but it also means he's still developing. That could be both pro and con depending on other factors.\n\nHe identifies as White, which doesn't directly indicate risk but could relate to systemic issues if there are underlying societal factors. Not sure yet how that plays in here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That suggests he hasn't hit the legal system's final stage, which might mean he's still trying to change his ways or maybe has some mental health issues holding him back from being convicted.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant for recidivism risk unless there's an issue with substance abuse, which isn't indicated here. He's 6'5\" and weighs 220 lbs; no mention of past drug use in the past four years, so maybe he's clean.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be a protective factor because he might not have access to substance abuse or domestic issues that could lead to more problems. But also, living alone doesn't necessarily mean he's safe from other risks like family issues.\n\nNot married and living alone again reinforces the idea of low risk in terms of family dynamics, but it's possible he has other social circles or support systems elsewhere.\n\nHe holds one job during the year. Having a steady job is usually positive for recidivism as it shows responsibility and self-sufficiency. However, if his job doesn't provide enough resources or opportunities to change his life, that could be a risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in past four years; no mention of mental health issues over the past month either. That's actually a strong indicator of stability and low risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of three. Sibling relationships can influence behavior, but unless there are issues like abuse or neglect, it might not be a significant risk factor. He considers God as something influencing his personal decisions, which suggests a level of moral responsibility that could aid in recidivism.\n\nPutting all this together: low to medium risk. The factors that pull towards low risk include no prior convictions, clean drug history, stable job, living alone (which is protective), and moral considerations from his beliefs. However, his age might suggest he's still developing, but since he's close to 20, it's probably a point toward lower risk.\n\nSo I'd assign each factor as low or medium based on these observations and then weigh them collectively towards a NO prediction with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which typically indicates a period of development where positive change is possible.
