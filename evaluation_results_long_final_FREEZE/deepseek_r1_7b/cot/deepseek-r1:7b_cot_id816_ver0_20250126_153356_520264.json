    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old female rearresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which is relatively young, but she has a history of criminal behavior. Being White might influence due to systemic factors, but in this case, it doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are underlying biases, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's high risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. They might be important for other assessments but not here.\n\nMarital status: she's never married, which isn't directly linked to recidivism unless there are family dynamics involved, which aren't mentioned. So probably low impact.\n\nShe's living with someone who's not alone\u2014maybe more support could help reduce risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nNo children listed, but she was in a household of four at a young age in a rural area. Being raised in such conditions can sometimes lead to higher stress or substance use issues, which might contribute to reoffending. So medium to high risk.\n\nHer educational background: high school diploma and attending college. College attendance is generally protective as it signals better opportunities and less time spent on criminal activities. So that's a low factor.\n\nEmployment history: she held one job during the year. Some work experience can be positive, but if it was in a non-criminal context, that's good. But since she's been convicted, having some employment might indicate responsibility, so maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase recidivism risk because of potential substance abuse issues and possible ties to criminal activities. So high risk here.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. If there were prior issues, it could affect her ability to reintegrate successfully, but since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe less impact. But if she had mental health issues before, that would be a concern.\n\nHer belief in God might relate to her personal struggles with substance abuse or mental health, which are risk factors on their own. So medium to high risk due to possible underlying issues affecting her decision-making and behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), living situation potentially related to stress (medium), belief in God possibly linked to prior issues (high). The positive factors like education and work are lower but not enough to outweigh the negatives. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending due to a history of criminal behavior which may indicate past responsibility or lack thereof in avoiding further issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana use, can lead to increased risk of relapse and subsequent offenses.
