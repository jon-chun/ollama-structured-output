    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down all the factors given.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old, which is considered a young age when released from incarceration. Young adults often have less life experience and may not be as stable in their lives, so that could be a medium factor contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and there might be some racial disparities in the criminal justice system. However, without specific data linking his race directly to higher rearrest rates, I'd lean towards low risk based on this alone.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. Since it's a minor offense, that doesn't carry significant weight towards predicting future recidivism compared to a more serious conviction.\n\nStanding at 5'4\" and weighing 170 lbs is within the average range for his age group. Weight isn't typically a strong predictor unless there are issues like obesity linked to higher risk, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence stability, but without other factors like substance use or unemployment, it doesn't seem particularly concerning on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is usually a good indicator; having completed high school might suggest better opportunities ahead, which could lower recidivism risk.\n\nNo job experience during the year suggests he's unemployed or underemployed, which can contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors that might lead to recidivism. This factor could be medium in weight because unemployment is linked but not exclusively.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and isn't depressed now, so no recent drug use or mental health issues present. These are positive indicators for low risk.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two in a rural area. Growing up in a stable, supportive environment like this is generally protective against recidivism, so that's another medium factor.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects him personally might indicate a religious background, which can be protective if he's finding meaning in his life through spirituality rather than other factors.\n\nPutting all these together: no significant red flags, mostly positive indicators. The only potential areas are being 19 and living alone, but both aren't strong enough to tip the risk into medium or high. Therefore, I'd predict a low risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults often have less life experience and may not be as stable in their lives, contributing to potential recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can play a role in the criminal justice system, without specific data linking this individual's Black identity to higher rearrest rates, it is considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"A single non-convicted arrest does not strongly indicate a high risk of future recidivism compared to more serious convictions.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight for his age group do not inherently suggest higher risk without additional concerning factors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can influence stability, but without other risk factors like substance use or unemployment, it is considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma suggests better opportunities ahead, which can correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"No job experience indicates potential for underemployment or substance use issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression History\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and lack of depression indicate positive factors contributing to low risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing in a Household of Size 2 in Rural Area\", \"medium\", \"While living with his biological mother in a small household is protective, it's not as strong without other stabilizing factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Background\", \"low\", \"Considering God as a positive influence suggests a supportive environment that can contribute to lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
