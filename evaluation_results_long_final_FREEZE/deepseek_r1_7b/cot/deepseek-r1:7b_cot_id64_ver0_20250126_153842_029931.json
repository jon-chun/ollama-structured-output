    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. Hmm, I remember that race can influence recidivism rates in some studies, but it's not always straightforward. There might be systemic issues, but with only one prior arrest and a high school diploma, maybe her personal circumstances are more telling than her race. So perhaps low weight for this factor.\n\nShe has no family living with her; she's living alone. Living alone can affect her support system. Maybe it's medium risk because isolation could lead to stress or substance use issues, which might influence recidivism.\n\nHer past four years: she used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without significant mental health issues doesn't immediately point to high recidivism. So maybe low weight here since no major mental health indicators are present.\n\nShe's young at 22 and has only one job. At this age, having a stable job is positive, so maybe low risk factor for employment status.\n\nShe lived with both parents in an urban area when young. That might indicate she had a supportive environment as a child, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing. So probably low weight here.\n\nHer belief in God: that's more about personal spirituality and might not directly correlate with recidivism rates, so maybe no significant impact\u2014low weight.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either neutral or pointing towards lower risk except perhaps the prior arrest. But she only has one prior conviction, which is a mitigating factor considering she's young and has good support now. So my prediction is low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 22-year-old female:\n\n- **Race (White):** Low weight due to personal circumstances overshadowing systemic factors.\n- **Living Alone:** Medium weight as isolation may contribute but not significantly without additional issues.\n- **Drug Use (Marijuana):** Low weight since no major mental health indicators are present.\n- **Employment:** Low weight due to having a job, indicating stability.\n- **Family Environment:** Low weight as living with parents suggests support.\n- **Religion (God belief):** Low weight as spirituality doesn't directly correlate with recidivism.\n\nConsidering all factors and the mitigating influence of her personal circumstances, including the single prior arrest and stable environment, the prediction leans towards low risk. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Her being White may suggest systemic issues, but her personal circumstances indicate lower risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress or substance use risks, which might influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years without recent feelings of depression, indicating potential low risk from drug use alone.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having a job and not enrolled in college suggests stable employment, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents at an early age indicates a supportive environment that could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religion (God belief)\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may influence behavior but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates and does not indicate substance abuse or mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
