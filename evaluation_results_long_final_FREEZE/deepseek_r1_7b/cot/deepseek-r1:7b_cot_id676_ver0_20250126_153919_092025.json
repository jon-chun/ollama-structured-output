Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a lot of arrest history\u201422 times\u2014and 7 prior convictions. That seems really high, which would definitely increase his chance of reoffending. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe\u2019s 5'10\" and weighs 160 lbs. Weight isn't directly related to recidivism unless it's linked to underlying health issues or substance use, but since he's already using drugs, maybe that's a point, but I'm not sure how much weight that should carry. Maybe medium.\n\nHe\u2019s living alone, never married, and no high school diploma. He has only held one job, which isn't great for economic stability. Plus, his education level is low, so he might have fewer opportunities to improve his situation. Medium risk here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and most of the time he feels really down. Drug use can lead to unstable behavior and impulsive actions, which are bad for recidivism. High risk factor.\n\nHe was raised in a household of two with his biological mother in an urban area. That might indicate a more stable home environment compared to other factors like drug use, but it's still a contributing factor. Maybe medium.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with his life\u2014might suggest some degree of religiosity or lack thereof, which could affect motivation and stability. Medium risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple high-risk factors like arrest history, substance abuse, unstable living situation, and limited education point towards a high probability of rearrest. The prediction is YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High arrest history\", \"high\", \"Arrested 22 times with 7 prior convictions, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior that increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use and emotional distress\", \"high\", \"Has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, and is currently experiencing significant emotional distress, which can lead to impulsive or unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"Unstable living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner and not enrolled in college despite holding only one job, indicating limited opportunities for positive change and potential isolation issues.\"),\n    (\"Limited education\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college, which can limit access to resources and support systems aimed at reducing recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious disbelief\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life, which may impact motivation and stability but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
