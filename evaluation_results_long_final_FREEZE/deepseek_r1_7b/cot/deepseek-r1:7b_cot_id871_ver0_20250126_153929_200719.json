    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors mentioned.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with seven arrests and seven convictions. That seems like a lot, which is definitely a high risk factor because past behavior often predicts future behavior.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 120 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of recidivism unless it's an issue with substance use or health problems. Since she's using drugs (specifically cocaine) in the past four years, that's another significant factor because drug use can impair judgment and legal performance.\n\nShe's living alone, which might be a risk factor depending on the support system available to her, but without more info, I'll assume it's average unless there are other factors indicating instability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This could mean she has limited opportunities, leading her to engage in risky behaviors or find alternative ways that might lead to further involvement with the law.\n\nNot enrolled in college and no job during the year suggests she's not actively engaged in legitimate activities, which can contribute to staying out of trouble.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Young age (18) could mean less life experience, but it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are other factors like trauma.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood for a month might be related to substance use or stressors in her life. Emotional distress can make poor decisions, which might lead to further issues.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of five from a young age suggests she's experienced family dynamics and living conditions that could include neglect or abuse if there's no indication otherwise.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with her personal life indicates a possible lack of spiritual support, which some might find comforting but others not. However, this alone doesn't strongly suggest criminal behavior unless combined with other factors like trauma.\n\nPutting it all together: High number of arrests and convictions (7), ongoing drug use, lack of education and employment, living alone, and emotional distress from recent events. These factors all point towards a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"7 previous arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrest history is a strong indicator of past behavior, increasing the likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (cocaine) in the past four years\", \"high\", \"Ongoing substance abuse can impair judgment and legal performance, significantly contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may lead to engaging in risky behaviors or finding alternative ways that could result in further legal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Living alone at 18 years old\", \"low\", \"Living situation alone does not inherently increase risk without additional factors like trauma or neglect indicated elsewhere.\"),\n    (\"Emotional distress from recent events\", \"medium\", \"Recent mood issues may contribute to poor decision-making, potentially leading to further criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area.
