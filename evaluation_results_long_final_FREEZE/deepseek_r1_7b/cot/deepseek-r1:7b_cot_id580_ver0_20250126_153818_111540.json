    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor for this 22-year-old male and predict his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22, which is relatively young but not too young for reoffending. Young adults often have more flexibility in their choices after release.\n\nRace: He identifies as White. Generally, racial disparities in the criminal justice system can influence recidivism rates, though other factors like personal circumstances are also important.\n\nConvictions: He has one prior conviction. One conviction doesn't necessarily guarantee a second offense, but it does indicate some past behavior that could be a risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5 feet 2 inches and 120 lbs might not directly correlate to recidivism unless there's an indication of substance use or health issues. Since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, this might mitigate any risks associated with weight.\n\nMarital status: He is single and currently not living alone. Living arrangements can affect his stability and access to support, which could influence his likelihood of reoffending.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates as it provides better job opportunities and skills for reintegration into society.\n\nEmployment: He has held one job during the year. Job history is important; having some work experience can reduce recidivism risk because it demonstrates stability and ability to support oneself.\n\nDrug use: No recent drug use, which is a positive indicator. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates as substance abuse can lead to further crimes or self-harm.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism risk because untreated mental health can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nUpbringing: At a young age, he lived in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. Multi-child households and living in urban areas might have different dynamics that could either support or hinder stability. However, without specific evidence of abuse or neglect, it's hard to assess the impact on recidivism.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has nothing to do with his personal decisions. This might indicate a lack of religious guidance which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors but isn't directly tied to recidivism unless combined with other factors like unstable family environments.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor contributes differently. The most significant risk here seems to be the prior conviction and living situation. While age is young, having one conviction could increase the likelihood of reoffending. Marriage status and education are positive indicators that might lower the risk.\n\nBased on this analysis, his overall risk for rearrest within three years appears to be medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is 22, which is relatively young but not too young for reoffending.
