    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. So, we've got a 19-year-old Hispanic male with several factors to consider.\n\nFirst off, his criminal history: he has one prior arrest and is now convicted. That already points towards some recidivism risk because of the established pathway into legal trouble.\n\nHis demographics are another factor. At 5'4\" and weighing between 175-199 lbs, he's on the heavier side for his height. This might indicate a higher likelihood of substance abuse issues, which ties into his drug use history over the past four years (marijuana specifically). Substance abuse is a known contributor to recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so no family support network. His lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and not attending college could mean limited opportunities for positive development or stability upon release.\n\nOnly holding one job in the past year might suggest he's looking for steady employment but also indicates possible apathy towards long-term goals, which can contribute to unstable situations leading to further offenses.\n\nHis drug use history is a red flag. Substance abuse often correlates with risky behaviors and impulsive decisions that could lead to further arrests.\n\nLiving at a young age with eight people might have had some impact on his behavior; however, the positive aspect here is his belief in God's influence, which could offer hope or moral guidance, but it's also a factor that might not directly contribute positively to his risk score.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor points towards higher recidivism. The presence of a criminal history and multiple negative factors like education level, substance use, and family living situation are strong indicators for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Individual has one prior arrest which can indicate a possible pathway to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Positive drug use history, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with substance abuse issues that can lead to risky behaviors and increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for positive development and stability upon release, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Single Job History\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job may suggest limited income sources and potential apathy towards long-term goals, but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without additional factors like substance use or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can isolate an individual and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse without support from a family network.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Experiencing living with eight family members at a young age does not strongly indicate high risk, but lack of direct involvement from family could influence behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
