    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old male. I'm going to go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a high school diploma but is in college. That's usually a positive sign because education can lead to better job opportunities and stability. So, the educational background would probably be low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation alone isn't inherently bad, especially if he's stable. No kids means fewer stressors from family dynamics. That might be medium or low risk depending on other factors.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Using drugs can affect his mental health and job prospects. Since there's no recent depression, maybe it's not as significant now, so medium risk.\n\nEmployment: He held one job during the year. Having some income is better than nothing, but only one job might mean he relies on it heavily. Could be medium or low depending on what else supports him financially.\n\nPast residence: At a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in a rural area. That's quite an unusual situation. Rural living can have its pros and cons, but the extended family could add stress or dependency issues. That might lean towards medium risk because it's unique and not clear if it's beneficial.\n\nReligion: He believes God has something to do with his life. While spirituality is a positive factor, it doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless there's a religious accountability system in place, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nAge and gender: Being 21, he's still young, but male recidivism rates are higher than female. But since he's only been arrested once without a conviction, the age factor might not be as impactful. However, being male is a risk factor regardless of the number of arrests.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some positive factors like education and single living situation, but also negatives like limited employment and past residence issues. The presence of drug use adds uncertainty. Considering all these, I think his risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"This factor is low because having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests potential for future education and stability which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone, No Kids\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without kids may indicate some independence but could also be a source of stress or instability depending on other factors like employment status and living situation history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana Only in Past 4 Years)\", \"medium\", \"While he has used marijuana, there is no recent indication of depression which might suggest improved mental health.
