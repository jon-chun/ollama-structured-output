    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 21-year-old female and asked for a relative weight assignment on each risk factor before predicting rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, let's parse through the factors one by one. The person is White, which might be relevant due to potential racial disparities in the justice system. She has two prior convictions; that's a significant factor because more convictions can indicate more serious or frequent offenses, increasing the risk of recidivism.\n\nHer age being 21 suggests she's relatively young, but since it's her first offense as a minor, maybe that lowers the risk compared to someone with multiple offenses. However, considering she has two prior arrests, I'd still lean towards medium risk because she's a first-time offender despite having convictions elsewhere.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse without a high school diploma or GED. This could impact her ability to find employment, which is crucial for reducing recidivism. Lack of job experience might hinder her from finding stable employment, increasing the risk.\n\nNo job history during the year means she hasn't been actively seeking work, which can be a red flag. Without income support, she's more vulnerable to recurrence of criminal behavior. This factor would probably contribute to medium or high risk depending on other factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could have serious implications. drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to substance abuse disorders, which might affect employment and living conditions. However, if she's not feeling depressed now, maybe she's motivated to change, making this a medium risk.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed in the past month. This is positive as chronic depression can be a driver of criminal behavior. If she's mentally stable, it could lower the risk slightly, moving towards low or medium.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of five from a young age suggests she might have experienced some form of abuse or neglect, which can affect her mental health and decision-making. This is a strong indicator pointing towards high risk because such environments are often destabilizing.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life adds a positive influence but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism. However, it might suggest she's more likely to seek help or maintain stable relationships, which could mitigate risk a bit, moving it towards medium from high.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to assign each a relative weight. Prior convictions and age might be medium. Lack of job experience is also medium. Drug use is medium, but the positive indicators like living with parents are strong. So overall, she's at higher risk due to multiple negatives outweighing some positives.\n\nPutting it all together, her prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"medium\", \"She has two prior arrests and convictions, which can indicate a history of criminal behavior that may increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"She is 21 years old, which might suggest she is less likely to commit crimes in her youth compared to older individuals who have more established lives.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"She lacks a high school diploma or GED and has not enrolled in college, which may limit her opportunities for success and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.
