She's in school now, so maybe she has some stability from education. However, she's had three jobs in the past year, but that doesn't immediately signal high risk unless there were issues with those jobs.\n\nHer substance use history is a red flag\u2014marijuana and cocaine use over four years could indicate ongoing issues. Her recent feelings of low mood might be a sign of deeper mental health concerns, which can affect her ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four under God's influence adds some complexity. She might have experienced family dynamics that could contribute to her behavior or mental state. \n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past substance use, emotional state, living alone without support\u2014the risk of rearrest seems high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past substance use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"She has a history of substance use over four years, which can indicate ongoing behavioral issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"recent emotional low mood\", \"medium\", \"Her recent feelings of low mood could signal mental health issues or stressors that might affect her ability to reintegrate positively after release.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a support network can sometimes reduce risk, but combined with other factors like substance use and unstable living conditions from the past, it increases risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
