She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her foster parent(s) in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
