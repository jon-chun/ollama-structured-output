    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old female over the next three years. Let's see, she's mixed race, arrested once but not convicted, height and weight are given, married, living with spouse, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, no jobs in the past year, no drug use in four years, but some depression lately, lived in a household of four when young, and doesn't believe God affects personal events. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant risk factors here and assign them weights: low, medium, or high, based on their impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these to predict whether she's likely to be rearrested within three years.\n\nStarting with age: 22 years old. Generally, younger adults have higher recidivism rates, but 22 might be slightly older than the peak recidivism ages, which are often in the late teens and early twenties. So, maybe a medium risk here.\n\nNext, gender: female. Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, that would lean towards a low risk.\n\nRace: mixed race. Race can be a factor in sentencing and treatment in the justice system, but directly linking it to recidivism is complex and can be sensitive. I'll consider this as low impact unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise.\n\nArrest history: arrested once but not convicted. This suggests limited involvement with the criminal justice system, which is positive. Low risk.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism. So, this would be high risk.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is also linked to higher recidivism rates. Another high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: no use in four years, some depression recently. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, but since there's no current drug use, and only recent depressive feelings, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nFamily environment: married, living with spouse. Stable relationships can be protective factors against recidivism. So, low risk here.\n\nEarly household environment: lived in a four-person household at a young age. Not sure if this is relevant unless there's information about the household's stability or income level. I'll consider this low impact.\n\nReligious belief: believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Personal beliefs might not directly correlate with recidivism, so low impact.\n\nNow, compiling these:\n\n- Age: medium risk\n\n- Gender: low risk\n\n- Race: low risk\n\n- Arrest history: low risk\n\n- Education: high risk\n\n- Employment: high risk\n\n- Drug use: low risk\n\n- Family environment: low risk\n\n- Early household environment: low risk\n\n- Religious belief: low risk\n\nSo, out of these, education and employment are high-risk factors, while most others are low risk. The high risks in education and employment are concerning, as they are significant predictors.\n\nConsidering that she has no conviction, is currently in a stable relationship, and has no recent drug use, but lacks education and employment, I would predict a moderate chance of rearrest recidivism.\n\nPerhaps a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence of 60%. The high-risk factors in education and employment outweigh the low-risk factors in other areas, suggesting a notable risk, but not extremely high.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger adults have higher recidivism rates, but being 22 might be slightly past the peak ages.\"],\n    [\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"race\", \"low\", \"No specific data indicating higher recidivism for mixed race individuals.\"],\n    [\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction.\"],\n    [\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor.\"],\n    [\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year increases recidivism risk.\"],\n    [\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years and only recent depressive feelings.\"],\n    [\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Stable marriage and living with spouse is a protective factor.\"],\n    [\"early_household_environment\", \"low\", \"Unknown specifics, assumed low impact.\"],\n    [\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs not directly linked to recidivism.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n",
