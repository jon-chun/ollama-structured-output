    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's see, he's a 22-year-old Hispanic male, arrested twice, convicted, height 5'7\", weight 185 lbs, never married, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, had five jobs in the last year, used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently has been feeling down. Growing up, he lived with both bio parents in an urban area, household of six, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, let's list out the risk factors and see how they might play into recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: He's 22. Typically, younger ages are associated with higher recidivism rates, but by 22, some studies show that the peak recidivism years might be passing. So, maybe medium risk here.\n\n2. **Gender**: Male. Males have higher recidivism rates than females. So, high risk.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: Hispanic. Some studies indicate that certain ethnic groups may have higher recidivism rates due to socioeconomic factors. Medium risk.\n\n4. **Arrest and conviction history**: Arrested twice, convicted. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future offenses. High risk.\n\n5. **Marital status**: Never married, living alone. Unstable living situation and lack of social support can increase risk. High risk.\n\n6. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, not in college. Low education levels are linked to higher recidivism. High risk.\n\n7. **Employment stability**: Held five jobs in a year. That's pretty unstable. Employment instability is a risk factor. High risk.\n\n8. **Drug use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recent depressive feelings. Substance abuse and mental health issues are major predictors of recidivism. High risk.\n\n9. **Family environment**: Lived with both bio parents in an urban area, household of six. Growing up with both parents is generally positive, but living in an urban area might have its challenges. Maybe medium risk.\n\n10. **Spirituality**: Believes God influences personal events. Spirituality can sometimes be a protective factor, but it's hard to quantify. Low risk.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: High\n\n- Ethnicity: Medium\n\n- Arrest and conviction history: High\n\n- Marital status: High\n\n- Education: High\n\n- Employment stability: High\n\n- Drug use: High\n\n- Family environment: Medium\n\n- Spirituality: Low\n\nGiven that most of these factors are high risk, especially the arrest and conviction history, employment instability, drug use, and lack of education, it's looking like a high risk of recidivism.\n\nBut let's think about some potential protective factors. He grew up with both parents, which is positive. His spirituality might also be a supportive element. However, these seem outweighed by the numerous high-risk factors.\n\nSo, my prediction is that there is a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet me put this into the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Typically, younger ages are associated with higher recidivism rates, but by 22, some peak recidivism years might be passing.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Certain ethnic groups may have higher recidivism rates due to socioeconomic factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Unstable living situation and lack of social support can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Low education levels are linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Employment instability is a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse and mental health issues are major predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both parents is generally positive, but urban area may have challenges.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can sometimes be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
