    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander. Age is an important factor in recidivism studies. Young adults, especially in their early twenties, are still developing maturity and may be more impulsive. However, being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, age might slightly increase risk, but gender decreases it.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that while there was an encounter with the law, it didn't lead to a conviction, which could indicate that the arrest may have been unfounded or the charges were dropped. This is a low-risk factor.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014don't typically correlate directly with recidivism risk. So, I'll consider these neutral.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk if it means lack of social support, but this isn't always the case. Given her age and educational pursuits, it might be normal for her to live alone. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is a significant protective factor against recidivism. Higher education generally leads to better employment opportunities and lower recidivism rates. This is a strong low-risk factor.\n\nEmployment: She has held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is another protective factor. Frequent job changes could be a risk, but having held two jobs might indicate flexibility and adaptability, which are positive traits. I'll consider this low risk.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years and has had periods of depression recently. Substance use and mental health issues are both significant risk factors for recidivism. Drug use can lead to criminal behavior, and mental health struggles can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of reoffending. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nFamily background: She lived with both biological parents in a household of four during her upbringing. Stable family environments are generally protective against delinquency and recidivism. This is a low-risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes that God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, which may reduce the likelihood of reoffending. This is another low-risk factor.\n\nNow, let's compile these factors:\n\n1. Age and gender: Slightly increased risk due to age, but decreased due to gender. Overall, medium risk.\n\n2. Arrest without conviction: Low risk.\n\n3. Physical attributes: Neutral.\n\n4. Marital status and living situation: Low risk.\n\n5. Education level: Low risk.\n\n6. Employment history: Low risk.\n\n7. Drug use and mental health: High risk.\n\n8. Family background: Low risk.\n\n9. Religious beliefs: Low risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of drug use and mental health issues stands out as a significant risk factor. However, the majority of other factors are low risk, particularly her education, employment, and family background.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict a moderate risk of recidivism. But since only \"YES\" or \"NO\" is allowed for prediction, and considering that one high-risk factor in the presence of multiple low-risk factors might still indicate a possible risk, I'll lean towards predicting \"YES\" with a confidence level of, say, 60%.\n\nSo, my final assessment is:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age and gender\", \"medium\", \"Slightly increased due to age, but decreased due to gender.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"No conviction suggests minimal criminal history.\"),\n\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"neutral\", \"Height and weight are not risk factors.\"),\n\n    (\"Marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at her age may be normal, especially with educational pursuits.\"),\n\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Higher education reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is protective.\"),\n\n    (\"Drug use and mental health\", \"high\", \"Substance use and mental health issues increase recidivism risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide moral support and guidance.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 60\n\n}\n\n",
