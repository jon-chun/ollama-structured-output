    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's see, he's a 20-year-old white male, arrested once, convicted, height 6'1\", weight between 150-174 lbs, never married, not living alone, has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, no jobs in the past year, drug use history including marijuana and cocaine, some depression symptoms, lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area, and he doesn't believe God affects personal events.\n\nFirst off, let's consider age. He's 20, which is relatively young. Statistics show that younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but also have higher rates of desisting from crime as they age. So, I'd say age is a medium risk factor here.\n\nNext, gender: male. Males are generally more prone to criminal behavior than females, so that's another medium risk factor.\n\nRace: white. In many studies, race can be a factor, but in this context, being white might not necessarily indicate higher or lower risk compared to other races. So, I'll label this as low risk.\n\nArrest and conviction history: he's been arrested once and convicted. This suggests some level of involvement in criminal activity, which is a medium to high risk factor. Given it's only once, I'll go with medium.\n\nPhysical attributes: height and weight. These don't typically correlate directly with recidivism rates, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married. Some research suggests that being unmarried can be associated with higher recidivism rates, perhaps due to less stability or support. So, medium risk.\n\nLiving situation: not living alone. This could indicate he has some social connections, which might be positive, but depending on who he's living with, it could also have negative influences. Hard to say definitively, so medium risk.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education level can be inversely related to recidivism; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. So, having just a high school diploma is a medium risk factor.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be linked to higher criminal activity due to lack of legitimate opportunities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: history of marijuana and cocaine use. Drug abuse is strongly correlated with criminal behavior, both as a cause and consequence. Given his recent use, this is a high risk factor.\n\nMental health: some depression symptoms. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities, especially if untreated. This is a medium to high risk factor. I'll call it high.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Family structure can be important; living with both parents is generally protective, but since he's only with his mother, that might indicate some family instability. Rural areas sometimes have different social dynamics and fewer opportunities. So, medium risk.\n\nReligious belief: believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against recidivism, so lack thereof might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: medium\n\n- Gender: medium\n\n- Race: low\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: medium\n\n- Physical attributes: low\n\n- Marital status: medium\n\n- Living situation: medium\n\n- Education: medium\n\n- Employment: high\n\n- Drug use: high\n\n- Mental health: high\n\n- Family background: medium\n\n- Religious belief: medium\n\nLooking at this list, there are several medium risk factors and a few high ones related to employment, drug use, and mental health. These high-risk factors are significant and suggest a considerable chance of rearrest within three years.\n\nConsidering the weight of these factors, particularly the high-risk ones like employment status, drug use, and mental health, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that some factors, like age and education, might work in the opposite direction, potentially reducing the risk over time. But given the current circumstances, especially the lack of employment and the active drug use, these are strong indicators of continued criminal behavior.\n\nI would estimate the confidence in this prediction to be around 75%. This takes into account the significant risks posed by unemployment, drug use, and mental health issues, while also considering potentially mitigating factors like his age and living situation.\n\nSo, my final assessment is:\n\n- Prediction: YES, likely to be rearrested within three years.\n\n- Confidence: 75%\n\n**Final Output**\n\nTo present the analysis in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher criminal tendencies but also higher chances of desisting from crime.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher rates of criminal behavior compared to females.\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being white may not necessarily indicate higher or lower risk in this context.\"],\n    [\"Arrest/Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest and conviction indicate some involvement in criminal activity.\"],\n    [\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly correlated with recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, which can be associated with higher recidivism due to less stability.\"],\n    [\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone could indicate social connections, but depends on the quality of relationships.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests some education, but lower than college degree which is better for reducing recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year; unemployment is linked to higher criminal activity due to lack of opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana and cocaine use, which is strongly correlated with criminal behavior.\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Some depression symptoms, which can increase likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"],\n    [\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a rural area; family structure and location may influence social dynamics and opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no personal impact, and religious involvement can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
