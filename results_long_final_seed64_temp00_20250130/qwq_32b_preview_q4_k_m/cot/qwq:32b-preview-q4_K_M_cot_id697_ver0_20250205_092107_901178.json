    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's see, he's a 22-year-old white male, arrested six times, convicted, height 5'10\", weight 170 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED, not in college, no jobs in the past year, drug use history including marijuana and cocaine, no recent depression, lived with non-biological parents in a small household in a rural area, and he doesn't believe God affects his personal life. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. He's 22, which is young. Generally, younger individuals have higher recidivism rates, but by 22, some may be settling down. So, maybe medium risk here.\n\nNext, being male is a risk factor, as males are more likely to reoffend than females. So, high for this one.\n\nRace could be a factor, but it's tricky. In some studies, race doesn't correlate directly with recidivism once other factors are controlled for. But given the justice system's biases, I'll consider it as low risk.\n\nArrest history: six arrests and convicted. That's significant. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of offending, and being convicted suggests more serious offenses. High risk here.\n\nHeight and weight might not directly correlate with recidivism, so I'll label this as low.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate lack of social support, which is a risk factor. So, maybe medium.\n\nEducation: GED, not in college. GED is achieved, but not pursuing higher education could suggest limited opportunities or motivation. Medium risk.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. High risk.\n\nDrug use: history of marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit. High risk.\n\nMental health: no recent depression. That's positive, so low risk here.\n\nFamily background: lived with non-biological parents in a small household in a rural area. This could suggest instability in early life, which is a risk factor. Medium risk.\n\nReligious belief: doesn't believe God affects his personal life. Spirituality and religious involvement can be protective factors against recidivism. So, lack thereof might indicate higher risk. Medium.\n\nNow, compiling these:\n\n- Age: medium\n\n- Male: high\n\n- Race: low\n\n- Arrest history: high\n\n- Height/weight: low\n\n- Marital status/living situation: medium\n\n- Education: medium\n\n- Employment: high\n\n- Drug use: high\n\n- Mental health: low\n\n- Family background: medium\n\n- Religious belief: medium\n\nLooking at this, most of the factors are medium to high risk, with only race and mental health being low. Particularly concerning are the arrest history, employment status, and drug use.\n\nGiven this profile, I would predict a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. Maybe around 80% confidence.\n\nSo, in JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age, 22, with higher recidivism tendencies but potentially stabilizing\"),\n\n(\"male\", \"high\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates\"),\n\n(\"race\", \"low\", \"Race may not be directly correlated with recidivism once other factors are controlled\"),\n\n(\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of offending\"),\n\n(\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n\n(\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support\"),\n\n(\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED but not enrolled in college suggests limited opportunities or motivation\"),\n\n(\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for a year is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n\n(\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including cocaine, increases risk of reoffending\"),\n\n(\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive\"),\n\n(\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Non-biological parents and small household in rural area may indicate instability\"),\n\n(\"religious_belief\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's personal influence might indicate lower protective factor\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\n",
