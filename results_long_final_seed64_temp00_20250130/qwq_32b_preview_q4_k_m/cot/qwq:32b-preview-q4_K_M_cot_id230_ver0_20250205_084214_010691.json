    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's see, he's a 22-year-old white male, arrested twice, convicted, height 5'7\", weight 168 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma, enrolled in a four-year college, held one job in the past year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the last four years, no depression in the past month, lived with both bio parents in an urban area in a household of five, and believes God has some influence on personal matters.\n\nFirst off, let's list out the potential risk factors and see how they apply here.\n\n1. **Age**: Younger age is often associated with higher recidivism rates. At 22, he's still relatively young.\n\n2. **Gender**: Male, which statistically has higher rates of recidivism compared to females.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: White. Recidivism rates can vary by race, but in many studies, whites have lower recidivism rates compared to minorities.\n\n4. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Two arrests, convicted. Prior convictions can indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married. Being unmarried can be a risk factor.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: Living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support.\n\n7. **Education Level**: High school diploma, enrolled in college. Higher education levels generally correlate with lower recidivism rates.\n\n8. **Employment History**: Held one job in the past year. Stable employment is positive, but having only one job might indicate instability.\n\n9. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n10. **Mental Health**: No depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but he doesn't report depression currently.\n\n11. **Family Background**: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of five. Stable family background is positive.\n\n12. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God has some personal influence. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism.\n\nAlright, let's assign relative weights to these factors.\n\n1. **Age**: Low risk. At 22, he's slightly older than the typical high-risk age group, which is often in the late teens to early twenties.\n\n2. **Gender**: High risk. Males have higher recidivism rates.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Low risk. Whites generally have lower recidivism rates.\n\n4. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Medium risk. Two arrests, convicted, suggests some propensity but not an extensive history.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Medium risk. Never married, which can be a risk factor.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: Medium risk. Living alone may lack social support, which can be important for staying on track.\n\n7. **Education Level**: Low risk. Enrolled in college suggests positive engagement and prospects.\n\n8. **Employment History**: Medium risk. Only one job in the past year might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\n9. **Drug Use**: High risk. Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant red flag.\n\n10. **Mental Health**: Low risk. No current depression is positive.\n\n11. **Family Background**: Low risk. Stable family environment is beneficial.\n\n12. **Religious Beliefs**: Low risk. Belief in God's personal influence might provide moral guidance and support.\n\nNow, let's weigh these factors collectively.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Young age slightly beyond high-risk period\n\n- White race with lower recidivism rates\n\n- Education and enrollment in college\n\n- Stable family background\n\n- No current depression\n\n- Believes in God's personal influence\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Male gender\n\n- Prior arrests and convictions\n\n- Unmarried and living alone\n\n- Only one job in the past year, possibly unstable employment\n\n- Recent drug use of marijuana and cocaine\n\nThe positives suggest a potentially lower risk, but the negatives, especially the drug use and prior convictions, are significant concerns.\n\nGiven that, I would predict a higher chance of rearrest recidivism due to the drug use and prior convictions, despite the positive factors like education and family background.\n\n**Prediction:** YES\n\n**Confidence:** 70%\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"low\", \"22 years old, slightly beyond high-risk age range\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Male, higher recidivism rates\"),\n\n(\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White, lower recidivism rates\"),\n\n(\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests, convicted\"),\n\n(\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married\"),\n\n(\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, possible lack of support\"),\n\n(\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, enrolled in college\"),\n\n(\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held one job in the past year, potential instability\"),\n\n(\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine\"),\n\n(\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month\"),\n\n(\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment\"),\n\n(\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has personal influence\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",
