    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old white female over the next three years. Let's see, she's been arrested once but not convicted, which is interesting. She's enrolled in a two-year college, has a high school diploma, and has held one job in the past year. She's living alone, never been married, and has some drug use history\u2014cocaine, specifically, in the past four years. Fortunately, she hasn't been feeling depressed lately, which is a positive sign. Her upbringing was stable; she lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Also, she believes that God plays a role in personal events, which might indicate some level of spirituality or moral framework.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to break this down into individual risk factors and assess each one's impact on the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n**1. Age: 19 years old**\n\nYoung age is often associated with higher recidivism rates because younger individuals may be more impulsive and have less life experience. However, she's enrolled in college, which could be a protective factor. But inherently, being 19 might still carry a medium risk.\n\n**2. Gender: Female**\n\nFemales generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, being female would likely be a low-risk factor.\n\n**3. Race: White**\n\nRace can be a sensitive factor, but statistically, in some jurisdictions, certain races may have different recidivism rates. However, without specific data, I'll consider this a neutral factor, so low risk.\n\n**4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction**\n\nAn arrest without conviction could suggest that the charges were dropped or she was found not guilty. This might indicate a lower risk compared to someone with convictions. So, low risk.\n\n**5. Education: High school diploma, enrolled in 2-year college**\n\nEducation is generally protective against recidivism. Higher education levels are associated with lower recidivism rates. Therefore, this would be a low-risk factor.\n\n**6. Employment: Held 1 job in the past year**\n\nEmployment is another protective factor. However, holding only one job in a year might not be as strong as having stable, long-term employment. So, perhaps medium risk.\n\n**7. Drug use: Cocaine in past four years**\n\nDrug use, especially of illicit substances like cocaine, can be a significant risk factor for recidivism. Substance abuse often co-occurs with criminal behavior. Therefore, this would be a high-risk factor.\n\n**8. Depression: None in the past month**\n\nMental health issues like depression can increase the risk of recidivism. Since she hasn't been feeling depressed lately, this is a low-risk factor.\n\n**9. Family structure: Lived with both biological parents in urban area, household size 4**\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents is generally considered protective. Stable family environments can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. Thus, low risk.\n\n**10. Spirituality: Believes God has something to do with personal events**\n\nSpirituality or religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and support. So, this could be a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, let's compile these assessments:\n\n- Age: Medium risk\n\n- Gender: Low risk\n\n- Race: Low risk\n\n- Arrest history: Low risk\n\n- Education: Low risk\n\n- Employment: Medium risk\n\n- Drug use: High risk\n\n- Depression: Low risk\n\n- Family structure: Low risk\n\n- Spirituality: Low risk\n\nLooking at this list, most factors are low risk, with medium risks for age and employment, and a high risk for drug use.\n\nGiven that, the overall risk seems to be pulled down by the multiple low-risk factors, but the high-risk factor of drug use is significant.\n\nIn making a prediction, I need to weigh these factors. Drug use, especially cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism due to the potential for continued illegal activity related to substance abuse.\n\nHowever, her current situation shows some positive elements: she's in college, which suggests she's investing in her future, and she's not currently depressed, which is good.\n\nBut the fact that she has used cocaine in the past four years is a red flag. Substance use disorders can lead to repeated involvement with the criminal justice system, either due to drug-related crimes or other offenses committed to support drug habits.\n\nConsidering all this, I would predict a higher chance of rearrest within three years due to the drug use history, despite the protective factors.\n\nLet's say, based on these factors, I estimate a 60% confidence in predicting recidivism.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 60.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age can indicate higher impulsivity and lower life experience, which may lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Without specific jurisdictional data, race is considered a neutral factor here.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests possible minor or unsubstantiated legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college indicates investment in future and lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job in the past year suggests some employment stability, but not fully established.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"History of cocaine use in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"Family structure\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n",
