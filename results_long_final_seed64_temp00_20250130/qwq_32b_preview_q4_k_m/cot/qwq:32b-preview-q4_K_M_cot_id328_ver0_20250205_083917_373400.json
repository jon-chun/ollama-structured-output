    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the subject is a 22-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender are important factors in recidivism predictions. Generally, younger individuals have higher recidivism rates, but being female typically lowers the risk compared to males. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that her involvement with the criminal justice system is minimal. Lack of conviction could indicate that the arrest was unfounded or that the charges were dismissed, which might lower the recidivism risk. So, I'll consider this as a low risk factor.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk unless there's specific context suggesting otherwise. So, I'll omit these from my assessment.\n\nMarital status: She has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support, but this isn't universally true. Given her age, it might be early to expect marriage, so I'll consider this a low to medium risk factor.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled in college could be a medium risk factor, as continued education can provide positive opportunities and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nEmployment: She has held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability, which might be a medium to high risk factor. However, at her age, it's not uncommon for individuals to try out different jobs to find their career path, so I'll lean towards medium.\n\nDrug use: She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time in the past month, she has felt down but nothing could cheer her up. This suggests potential depression or other mental health issues. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, but since she hasn't used drugs recently, that's positive. However, her current emotional state could be a concern if it leads to poor decision-making. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nEarly life: She lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence recidivism. Living with both parents is often considered protective, but since she was with her biological mother only, it might be a medium risk factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might also influence risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes that God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism by providing moral guidance and social support. This could be a low risk factor.\n\nNow, let's compile these assessments:\n\n1. Age: Medium\n\n2. Gender: Low\n\n3. Arrest history: Low\n\n4. Marital status and living situation: Medium\n\n5. Education level: Medium\n\n6. Employment stability: Medium\n\n7. Substance use and mental health: Medium\n\n8. Early family environment: Medium\n\n9. Religious beliefs: Low\n\nOverall, most factors are medium risk, with a few low-risk factors. There are no high-risk factors noted in the information provided.\n\nGiven this balanced profile with mostly medium risks, I would predict a moderate likelihood of recidivism over the next three years. However, since the majority of factors are medium and there are some low-risk elements, I'll lean towards a negative prediction with moderate confidence.\n\nPrediction: NO\n\nConfidence: 70\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but being female decreases it.\"),\n\n(\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction.\"),\n\n(\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate limited social support.\"),\n\n(\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college.\"),\n\n(\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held three jobs in a year, suggesting instability.\"),\n\n(\"substance_use_and_mental_health\", \"medium\", \"No recent drug use, but reports of depression.\"),\n\n(\"early_family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area.\"),\n\n(\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events, which can be a protective factor.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",
