    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old white female over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst off, she's 22 years old. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to be involved in crime, but as they age, the likelihood decreases. So, being 22, she's still relatively young, which might suggest a higher risk. But I need to consider this in conjunction with other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested six times and has convictions. That's a substantial number of arrests, which typically correlates with higher recidivism rates. Each arrest could indicate a pattern of behavior that may continue. So, this is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma, and she's not enrolled in college. Education levels can influence employment opportunities and overall life prospects. Lower education levels are sometimes associated with higher crime rates, but it's not always straightforward. She does have a high school diploma, which is better than no diploma, but not pursuing higher education might limit her job options.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history is important because stable employment can be a protective factor against reoffending. However, holding multiple jobs in a short period might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use is another critical aspect. She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior, both as a cause and a consequence. The fact that she has used multiple drugs suggests a potential substance abuse issue, which increases the risk of recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can complicate rehabilitation efforts, so the absence of recent depression is a plus.\n\nHer living situation: she's not married and not living alone. Living circumstances can affect one's environment and support systems. Not being married isn't necessarily a risk factor, but lacking a stable partnership might mean fewer social supports.\n\nFamily background: she lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of five. Family structure and environment during upbringing can have long-term effects on behavior. Living with both parents is generally considered beneficial, but the urban environment and household size could have various implications.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes serve as a protective factor, providing guidance and support.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old - Medium risk. While young age is a risk factor, it's not as high as in younger teens.\n\n2. **Arrest and conviction history**: Six arrests with convictions - High risk. Frequent arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Education level**: High school diploma, not in college - Medium risk. Having a diploma is positive, but lack of higher education might limit opportunities.\n\n4. **Employment history**: Held two jobs in the past year - Medium risk. Job instability could be a concern.\n\n5. **Drug use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years - High risk. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism.\n\n6. **Mental health**: No depression in the past month - Low risk. Absence of recent mental health issues is positive.\n\n7. **Living situation**: Not married, not living alone - Medium risk. Living circumstances may affect support systems.\n\n8. **Family background**: Lived with both parents in an urban area - Medium risk. Stable family structure is positive, but urban environment could have variables.\n\n9. **Spiritual beliefs**: Believes God influences personal events - Low to medium risk. Could serve as a protective factor.\n\nConsidering these factors, the high-risk indicators are the arrest and conviction history and drug use. The medium-risk factors include age, education level, employment history, and living situation. The low-risk factors are her current mental health status and spiritual beliefs.\n\nGiven this assessment, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within the next three years. The confidence in this prediction is fairly high due to the significant number of high and medium risk factors, particularly the extensive arrest history and drug use.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Being 22 years old suggests some level of risk, but not as high as younger ages.\"),\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Six arrests with convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year suggests possible employment instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not married and not living alone may affect support systems.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family structure, but urban environment could have variables.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence could be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
