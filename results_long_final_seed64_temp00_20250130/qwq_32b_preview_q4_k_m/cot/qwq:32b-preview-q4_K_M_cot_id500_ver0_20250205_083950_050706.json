    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old Black female over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst, her demographic details: She's 22, female, identifies as Black, stands at 5'5\" and weighs 130 lbs. Age is an important factor in recidivism; generally, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but being female tends to be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, her age might slightly increase the risk, but her gender might mitigate that.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a significant point. Having a prior conviction is a strong indicator of future offending, especially if the offense was serious. However, since it's only one arrest and conviction, perhaps the severity of the crime would be crucial here. Unfortunately, we don't have details on the nature of the offense, so I'll have to consider this as a medium-risk factor.\n\nShe's living alone and has never been married. Living situation can impact recidivism; stable housing and social support are protective factors. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. But she's managing on her own, which also shows some level of independence. I'll rate this as low to medium risk.\n\nEducational background: She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being in college might suggest limited opportunities or disinterest in further education, which could be a risk factor. But having a high school diploma is better than no diploma, so perhaps low to medium risk here.\n\nEmployment: She's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is crucial; consistent employment can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Holding only one job might indicate stability, but the duration at that job would be important. If it's a long-term job, that's positive; if it's recent, it might be too early to tell. Since we don't have that detail, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. Cocaine is particularly concerning due to its higher potential for addiction and related crimes. So, this is a high-risk factor.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be linked to higher recidivism rates, but since she doesn't report depression currently, this might be a low-risk factor.\n\nEarly life circumstances: She lived with her biological mother in a large household of nine in a rural area. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence criminal behavior. Growing up in a large household might indicate potential chaos or limited parental supervision, which could be a risk factor. Rural areas sometimes have different social dynamics and opportunities compared to urban areas, which might also play a role. I'll consider this a medium-risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against recidivism, providing moral guidance and social support. So, this might be a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors:\n\n- Age and gender: Low to medium risk\n\n- Prior arrest and conviction: Medium risk\n\n- Living situation: Low to medium risk\n\n- Education: Low to medium risk\n\n- Employment: Low risk\n\n- Substance use: High risk\n\n- Mental health: Low risk\n\n- Early life circumstances: Medium risk\n\n- Religious beliefs: Low risk\n\nGiven these factors, the high-risk factor of substance use stands out, especially the use of cocaine, which is a drug with a strong association with criminal behavior. The prior conviction also weighs heavily. However, there are several low to medium risk factors that might offset some of the higher risks.\n\nConsidering all this, I would predict a YES for rearrest recidivism within three years, but with a confidence level around 70%. The high-risk factor of substance use and the prior conviction are significant indicators, but the presence of protective factors like being female, having a high school diploma, stable employment, and religious beliefs suggest that the risk isn't extremely high.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age and Gender\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but being female decreases it.\"],\n    [\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"medium\", \"Only one conviction; nature of offense unknown.\"],\n    [\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with unknown social support.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job in the past year.\"],\n    [\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana and cocaine use.\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month.\"],\n    [\"Early Life Circumstances\", \"medium\", \"Large household in rural area.\"],\n    [\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
