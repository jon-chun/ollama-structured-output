    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person in question is an 18-year-old white female, arrested twice but no convictions yet. She's tall for her age, at 5'10\" and weighs 190 lbs, which might be something to consider in terms of physicality or health issues possibly. She's never been married, living alone, which could be a factor in terms of support systems.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't enrolled in college. That might suggest some challenges in terms of future employment and stability. Job history shows she's held five jobs in a year, which is pretty frequent turnover. That could indicate instability in her work life, possibly due to various reasons like not finding a good fit, disciplinary issues, or just restlessness.\n\nDrug use is mentioned: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's a significant red flag, especially the use of harder drugs like cocaine. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed in the last month is probably a positive, but her history might suggest underlying issues.\n\nBackground-wise, she lived with both biological parents in a rural area in a household of five. That might suggest a stable family environment, which is generally positive. Her belief in God having personal influence could indicate a spiritual dimension to her life, which some studies show can be protective.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to make a prediction: yes or no for high risk, and provide a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, the arrests without convictions could suggest that she's involved in risky behaviors, but without concrete evidence leading to conviction. The drug use is a major concern, especially cocaine, which is illicit and can indicate involvement in criminal activities or at least association with problematic peers.\n\nHer educational level and job instability are also worrying, as they can lead to continued cycles of poverty and potential engagement in crime to make ends meet.\n\nOn the other hand, her current lack of depression and seemingly stable family background might be protective factors.\n\nHmm. Overall, given the drug use history, job instability, and educational shortcomings, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n\nLet me think about confidence. If I had to put a number on it, maybe 85%. There are some mitigating factors, like the stable family background and current mental health status, but the drug use and job instability are significant indicators.\n\nSo, my response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nBut I should double-check. Is there anything I'm missing? Oh, her weight might be relevant if it's associated with health issues, but unless there's more information, it's hard to say. Maybe not directly relevant to criminal risk.\n\nAlright, I think that's a reasonable assessment based on the given factors.\n\n",
