    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 20-year-old white female with a few arrests and convictions. She's married, has a high school diploma, holds one job, has used marijuana in the past four years, has had some depressive feelings recently, lived with non-biological parents as a child in a large household, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider what these risk factors might imply in terms of future criminal behavior or recidivism. Being a risk assessment expert, I should be looking at evidence-based indicators that are statistically correlated with higher risks.\n\nStarting with demographic information: she's 20, female, white. Age is often a factor because younger individuals tend to have higher rates of criminal activity, but being female generally correlates with lower crime rates compared to males. So, being a young female might partially offset some risk, but not entirely.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and has convictions. This is a significant red flag. A history of arrests and convictions is one of the strongest predictors of future offending. The fact that she has been convicted suggests that her past behaviors have been severe enough to result in judicial sanctions, which increases concern about potential future offenses.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u2014height and weight\u2014don't typically factor into risk assessments unless there are specific circumstances where physical abilities relate to the type of crimes committed. In general, these aren't major predictors.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, which is generally considered a protective factor. Stable relationships can provide support and deter involvement in criminal activities. However, if the spouse has a criminal history, that could be a different story, but no information is provided about the spouse's background.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important; having a high school diploma is better than not, but higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. Not being enrolled in college could be neutral or slightly concerning, depending on other factors.\n\nEmployment history shows she's held one job during the year. Stable employment is another protective factor, suggesting she has a source of legal income and possibly positive social connections through work.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, in the past four years, and recent depressive feelings are noteworthy. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be associated with higher crime rates, especially if use is heavy or leads to dependency. Depression can also be a risk factor, as mental health issues may correlate with impaired judgment and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHer childhood living situation\u2014living with non-biological parents in a large household\u2014could indicate instability or trauma, which are recognized risk factors for future criminal behavior. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to various negative outcomes in adulthood, including involvement in crime.\n\nLastly, her belief in God's influence on personal events might be considered a protective factor, as religious involvement can sometimes buffer against engaging in criminal activities. However, this is not universally true and can depend on the nature of her beliefs and practices.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the history of arrests and convictions stands out as the most significant risk indicator. Despite having some protective factors like being married, employed, and having a high school diploma, the presence of drug use and depressive symptoms, combined with adverse childhood experiences, suggests that there are still notable risks present.\n\nI would predict that this individual represents a high risk, but I need to assign a confidence level. Given the mix of risk and protective factors, I wouldn't say it's an absolute certainty, but the historical convictions and recent drug use tip the scale towards higher risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of, say, 85.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
