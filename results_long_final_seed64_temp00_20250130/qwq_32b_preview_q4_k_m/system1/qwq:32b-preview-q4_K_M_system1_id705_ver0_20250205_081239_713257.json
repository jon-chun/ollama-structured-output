    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old white male. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 22, which is young, and males in this age group can sometimes be at higher risk for certain behaviors, but that's a generalization. He's white, which might or might not be relevant depending on the context. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests maybe a minor run-in with the law that didn't stick. That's somewhat concerning but not a major red flag.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 165 lbs, which seems average for his age and height. Not particularly tall or short, not overweight or underweight, so nothing stands out there.\n\nNever been married and not living alone. Living with others could be stabilizing, but it depends on the living situation. If he's living with family or supportive roommates, that might be positive. On the other hand, if it's a volatile living environment, that could be negative.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower risk. However, not being in college doesn't necessarily mean he's at higher risk; maybe he's focusing on his career or other pursuits.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, which is good in terms of employment stability. Consistent employment is generally positive and can reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a big plus. Substance abuse is often linked to higher risk behaviors, so his abstention from drugs is favorable.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is also positive. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with increased risk, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four suggests a certain family structure, but without knowing the dynamics, it's hard to assess. Generally, larger households might have different challenges, but again, it's not necessarily negative.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a moral compass and support system, which might lower risk.\n\nOverall, most of these factors seem neutral to positive. The only potential concern is the arrest without conviction, but given that it's a single incident and didn't lead to a conviction, it might not be indicative of higher risk. His stable employment, absence of drug use, and lack of recent depression are all positive signs.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would predict that he is not a high risk individual.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
