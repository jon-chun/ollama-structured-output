    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to consider, but since there's no conviction, it might not carry the same weight as a actual guilty verdict. Still, arrests can indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity, even if not proven in court.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 185 lbs. Physical attributes might not directly correlate with risk, but in some studies, certain body types or sizes could be associated with specific types of crimes. However, I don't place too much emphasis on this unless there's a specific context.\n\nLiving alone without any formal education beyond high school and no employment for a year is concerning. Lack of stable employment and education can be risk factors for engaging in criminal activities, especially if there are financial pressures or limited opportunities.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine, with recent use in the past month. This is significant because substance abuse is often linked to higher rates of criminal behavior, both due to the illegal nature of some drugs and the potential for drug-related crimes like theft to support addiction.\n\nMental health seems to be an issue here; he's been feeling down and nothing can cheer him up. Depression or other mental health issues can increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors, including crime, although this isn't always the case.\n\nHis living situation as a child is also noteworthy. Living with non-biological parents in a household of three in an urban area might suggest some instability in his early life, which could be a risk factor. Childhood experiences can have lasting impacts on behavior and decision-making later in life.\n\nLastly, his view on religion\u2014believing God has nothing to do with personal events\u2014might indicate a lack of spiritual guidance or community support, which some studies suggest could be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, I need to make a prediction on whether this indicates high risk. Given the arrest history, drug use, mental health issues, lack of education and employment, and some indicators of childhood instability, it seems like there are multiple red flags here.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation, and having these risk factors doesn't necessarily mean he will engage in criminal behavior. But statistically speaking, the presence of these factors does increase the probability.\n\nI would predict yes, this indicates high risk, but I'll assign a confidence level of, say, 80%. That leaves room for individual variation and the possibility that other protective factors not mentioned here might be present.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
