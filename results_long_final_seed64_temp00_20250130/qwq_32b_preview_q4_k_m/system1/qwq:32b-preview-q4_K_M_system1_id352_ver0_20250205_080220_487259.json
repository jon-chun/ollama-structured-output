    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Past criminal behavior is often a strong predictor of future offenses. So, that's definitely weighing heavily on the high-risk side.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. Physical attributes alone don't typically indicate risk, but in some contexts, like violent crimes, size can be a factor. However, I don't think that's particularly relevant here without more specific information.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be a factor; stable housing and social connections are often protective factors against reoffending. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk indicator.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. That's positive; education level is generally inversely related to recidivism. So, being enrolled in college is a good sign.\n\nEmployment: He's held one job during the year. Employment stability is important. Holding a job is positive, but having only one job might suggest limited work history or instability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is great. Substance abuse is closely linked to criminal behavior, so his abstinence from drugs is a strong protective factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is also positive. Mental health issues can be correlated with higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHis upbringing: He lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size four in an urban area. This could indicate a somewhat unstable home environment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nLastly, his view on religion: He believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Personal beliefs aren't typically direct indicators of recidivism risk, so I'll set that aside.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Negative factors: Two arrests with convictions, living alone, only one job held in the year.\n\n- Positive factors: Enrolled in college, no drug use in four years, no depression in the past month.\n\nGiven that he has convictions already, that carries a lot of weight. However, his current actions like being in school and maintaining employment suggest a move towards stability.\n\nBut considering that he's been convicted before, and convictions carry more weight than arrests, I have to lean towards a higher risk prediction.\n\nI'll predict \"YES\" for high risk, but with some reservations because of his current positive behaviors. So, confidence around 75%.\n\nWait, is 75% high enough? Convictions are serious, but his recent actions are positive. Maybe 60% confidence in high risk.\n\nHmm, maybe splitting the difference at 65%.\n\nBut in risk assessment, past convictions, especially if they're recent or severe, can override more recent positive behaviors. So, perhaps I should have higher confidence.\n\nLet me check the severity of the convictions. The information doesn't specify the nature of the convictions, which is a problem. If they were minor offenses, maybe lower risk, but if they were serious crimes, higher risk.\n\nSince I don't have that detail, I'll have to assume they're of a moderate nature.\n\nAlso, his age is 22, which is still relatively young. Younger adults sometimes have higher recidivism rates, but again, enrollment in college and employment suggest he's trying to turn things around.\n\nBut the convictions are a major mark against him.\n\nI think I need to stick with \"YES\" for high risk, given the convictions, but acknowledge that his current behaviors are positive.\n\nMaybe confidence at 70%.\n\nAlternatively, since I have to make a binary prediction based on available data, and convictions are a strong indicator, I should probably go with \"YES\" and a higher confidence level, say 80%.\n\nBut I'm a bit uneasy about that because his recent behavior suggests rehabilitation efforts.\n\nPerhaps 70% is a reasonable middle ground.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
