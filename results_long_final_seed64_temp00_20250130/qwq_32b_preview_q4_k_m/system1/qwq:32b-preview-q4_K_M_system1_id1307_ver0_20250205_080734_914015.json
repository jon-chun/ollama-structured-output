    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person in question is an 18-year-old male, identifies as Black, arrested twice but no convictions yet. He's tall, 6'2\", weighs 230 lbs, not married, living alone, currently enrolled in school, had two jobs in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years, no depression in the past month, grew up with his biological mom in an urban area, household size of five, and he believes God has some influence in his personal life.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to consider what these factors might imply in terms of risk assessment. Now, I know that age is a significant factor; young adults, especially males, tend to have higher rates of involvement in criminal activities. Being 18, he's at an age where impulsivity and peer influence might play a role.\n\nHis racial identity as Black could be relevant because there are disparities in the criminal justice system, with minorities often facing higher arrest rates. However, since he hasn't been convicted despite two arrests, it's possible that those arrests didn't lead to any charges or he was found not guilty.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is generally a positive sign, indicating that he's investing in his future and has some structure in his life. Having held two jobs in the year also suggests responsibility and perhaps a stable income, unless these were short-term positions.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is a factor to consider. While marijuana is becoming legalized in many places, its use can still be associated with certain risks, especially if it's frequent or if it leads to involvement with more serious substances or criminal networks.\n\nThe fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently is positive, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with risky behaviors.\n\nHis living situation\u2014living alone at 18\u2014might indicate independence, but it could also mean a lack of support systems, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHis background, growing up in an urban area with his biological mother and a household size of five, could suggest a potentially challenging environment, depending on the specific circumstances like socioeconomic status and neighborhood crime rates.\n\nLastly, his belief in God's influence on his personal life might indicate a sense of morality or guidance, which could be a protective factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to make a prediction: yes, high risk, or no, not high risk. And provide a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nHmm. The arrests suggest some level of involvement in activities that could be risky, but no convictions are a positive sign. He's in school and has held jobs, which are both positive indicators of stability and future orientation. The drug use is a concern, but it's specified as marijuana, which might be less risky compared to harder substances.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could be normal for some, especially if he's in college, but it depends on his support network.\n\nHis belief in God might serve as a moral compass, which could be protective.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards \"no,\" meaning he doesn't indicate high risk. But I need to assign a confidence level. Let's see, perhaps 70%. That seems reasonable, considering the mixed factors.\n\nWait, but his arrest history might warrant a higher consideration of risk. However, since there are no convictions, and he's engaged in education and employment, I think the positive factors outweigh the negatives.\n\nAlright, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
