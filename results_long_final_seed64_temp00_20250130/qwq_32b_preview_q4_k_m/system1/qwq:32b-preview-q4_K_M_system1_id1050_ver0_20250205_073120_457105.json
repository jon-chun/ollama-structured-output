    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male, arrested twice, convicted, height 5'7\", weight 185 lbs, never married, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, had five jobs in a year, used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently has been feeling down. Also, he grew up with both biological parents in an urban area of six people, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what these factors might indicate in terms of risk assessment. Being a 22-year-old male could be relevant because certain age and gender groups may have higher crime rates. Ethnicity might also play a role, but it's important to approach that sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on statistical trends rather than stereotypes.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant red flag. Criminal history is often a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. The frequency of arrests and the nature of convictions would be crucial here, but since that detail isn't provided, I'll have to consider it as a general indicator of risk.\n\nHis physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014might not be directly relevant unless there's specific context suggesting otherwise. For example, in certain types of crimes, physical strength could be a factor, but generally, these aren't primary risk indicators.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could potentially indicate a lack of social supports, which might correlate with higher risk. However, this isn't always the case, as many people live alone successfully without engaging in criminal activity.\n\nEducation level is another important factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of turning to crime. Additionally, not being enrolled in college suggests that he may not have access to further educational resources that could help him improve his situation.\n\nHolding five jobs in a year seems unstable. Frequent job changes can indicate impulsivity, inability to maintain employment, or other issues that might relate to higher risk. However, it could also be due to various personal circumstances, so it's not entirely conclusive on its own.\n\nDrug use is a major concern. Using marijuana and cocaine, especially within the past four years and with recent usage, suggests potential substance abuse problems. Drug use can be linked to criminal behavior both as a cause and an effect. It may lead to involvement in illegal activities to support drug habits or impair judgment and lead to risky behaviors.\n\nMental health is also a factor; feeling down and unable to cheer up could indicate depression or other mood disorders. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, although it's essential to approach this with sensitivity and not stigmatize mental illness.\n\nHis upbringing\u2014living with both biological parents in an urban area of six people\u2014might be seen as relatively stable, which could be a positive factor. However, the environment of an urban area could expose him to higher crime rates or peer influences that encourage criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, his belief in God's influence on personal events could be seen in different ways. Some research suggests that religious beliefs can have a protective effect against criminal behavior by providing moral guidelines and a sense of purpose. However, this isn't universally true, and some individuals may interpret their beliefs in ways that justify certain actions.\n\nOverall, considering the criminal history, drug use, mental health indicators, educational limitations, and employment instability, it seems like there are several risk factors present. The positive aspects, such as having grown up with both parents, might offer some resilience, but they may not outweigh the other issues.\n\nGiven all this, my prediction is that these risk factors indicate high risk. As for confidence, I'd say around 85%. There's a strong indication based on the provided information, but without more detailed data on the nature of convictions, the specific drugs used, and the severity of mental health issues, it's not possible to be entirely certain.\n\nSo, my response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
