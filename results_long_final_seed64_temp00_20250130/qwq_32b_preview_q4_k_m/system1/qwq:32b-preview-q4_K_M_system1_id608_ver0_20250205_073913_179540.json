    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 22-year-old white female with a few arrests and convictions. She's living alone, doesn't have much education, has held a few jobs, has a history of drug use, and has some religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and gender. Being 22 years old, she's young, and statistically, younger people might be at higher risk for certain behaviors. But being female might lean the other way, as females generally have lower crime rates than males. So, these factors might balance each other out.\n\nShe's white, and I need to consider if race plays a role in risk assessment. Ethically, race shouldn't be a determining factor unless there's specific contextual information that makes it relevant. So, I'll treat this as neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted, which is a significant red flag. Past criminal behavior is a strong predictor of future offenses. So, this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHer education level is low; she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to crime rates. Less education often correlates with higher crime rates, so this is another risk factor.\n\nShe's living alone, which could be neutral or a risk factor depending on the context. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also mean lack of support systems, which might increase risk.\n\nDrug use history is another major red flag. Using marijuana and cocaine indicates substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher rates of criminal activity. The fact that she used these drugs in the past four years suggests recent involvement, which is concerning.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might be a positive sign. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, so the absence of depression could be seen as lower risk in this area.\n\nHer childhood living situation\u2014living with her biological mother in a household of three\u2014doesn't provide enough information to assess risk. Family structure can be a factor, but without knowing the dynamics or any history of abuse or neglect, it's hard to assign risk based on this alone.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with personal events, which could indicate a sense of morality or accountability. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can have a protective effect against criminal behavior. So, this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nOverall, considering all these factors, the arrests and convictions, lack of education, drug use history, and living alone seem to indicate higher risk. The belief in God and not feeling depressed recently might slightly lower the risk, but the other factors outweigh these positives.\n\nI would predict \"YES\" for high risk. As for confidence, I'd say 85%. The multiple arrests, convictions, and drug use history are strong indicators, and the lack of education and stable living situation support this prediction. The religious beliefs and absence of depression might bring the confidence down from a higher number, but overall, the risk seems high.\n\nSo, my response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
