    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 22-year-old black male, arrested twice but not convicted, height 5'11\", weight between 175-199 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma, not in college, held three jobs in the past year, no drug use in the last four years, no depression in the past month, lived with his biological mother in a household of five when young, and believes God has personal influence in his life.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider what these risk factors might imply in terms of criminal justice risk assessment. Typically, risk assessments look at a variety of factors including demographic information, prior contacts with the law, educational background, employment history, substance abuse, mental health, family circumstances, and personal beliefs.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Demographics**: 22-year-old black male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might be more prone to certain types of crime, but this isn't always the case. Race is a sensitive topic in criminal justice, and it's important to approach this without bias. Statistically, there might be higher arrest rates for certain races, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with actual offending rates.\n\n2. **Legal History**: Arrested twice but no convictions. This could suggest that the arrests didn't lead to charges or that he was found not guilty. It's positive that there are no convictions, but the arrests themselves might indicate some level of involvement in problematic behavior, even if not resulting in conviction.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: Height and weight don't typically factor into risk assessments unless there's a specific context where physical strength or appearance might be relevant.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married, living alone. Living alone could sometimes be associated with higher risk because there might be less social support or supervision.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: High school diploma, not in college, held three jobs in the past year. Holding multiple jobs could indicate instability or a need for additional income, which might be due to various reasons, some of which could be related to risk.\n\n6. **Substance Abuse and Mental Health**: No drug use in the last four years and no depression in the past month. This is positive and suggests lower risk in these areas.\n\n7. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of five when young. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is sometimes associated with lower risk, but this varies widely.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God has personal influence. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective factors, as they may provide moral guidance and social support.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I need to make a prediction about high risk. Given that there are no convictions, no current substance abuse or mental health issues, and positive aspects like employment and religious beliefs, the overall risk seems low. The arrests without convictions could be a red flag, but in the context of no ongoing legal issues and stable employment, it might not indicate high risk.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of, say, 85%. This accounts for the lack of convictions, stability in employment, and absence of substance abuse or mental health problems, while still acknowledging that arrests could potentially indicate some level of risk.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
