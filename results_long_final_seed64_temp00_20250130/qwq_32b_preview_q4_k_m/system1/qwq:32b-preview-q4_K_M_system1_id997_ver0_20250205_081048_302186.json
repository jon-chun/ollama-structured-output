    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 19-year-old White female with a few specific characteristics.\n\nFirst, let's list out the risk factors:\n\n- Age: 19 years old\n\n- Gender: Female\n\n- Race: White\n\n- Arrest record: 1 arrest, convicted\n\n- Physical attributes: 6 feet 0 inches, 155 lbs\n\n- Marital status: Never married, not living alone\n\n- Education: No high school diploma or GED, enrolled in a 2-year college\n\n- Employment: Held 1 job during the year\n\n- Substance use: Used marijuana in the past four years, used some days in the past month\n\n- Mental health: Felt down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up some of the time in the past month\n\n- Family background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 7 in an urban area at a young age\n\n- Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nOkay, so I need to consider these factors and see if they indicate high risk. As a criminal justice risk assessment expert, I should be looking at factors that are statistically correlated with recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n\nLet's start with the arrest and conviction history. She has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant factor. Past behavior is often indicative of future behavior, especially in criminal justice contexts. So this ticks a box for higher risk.\n\nNext, education level. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED but is enrolled in a 2-year college. This is somewhat mixed. On one hand, lacking a high school diploma can be a risk factor for criminal behavior, as education is often protective. On the other hand, being enrolled in college suggests some level of engagement and perhaps a desire to improve her situation.\n\nEmployment history: Held only one job during the year. Stability in employment is generally positive, but having only one job might not provide sufficient economic stability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: Marijuana use in the past four years and some days in the past month. While marijuana is less risky than harder substances, any drug use can be associated with increased criminal behavior, especially if it leads to dependency or affects judgment.\n\nMental health: Feeling down and nothing can cheer her up some of the time in the past month suggests possible depression or other mood disorders. Mental health issues can be risk factors for criminal behavior, particularly if they are not being treated.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 7 in an urban area at a young age. Living with both biological parents is generally protective, but a large household might present its own challenges.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective, as it provides a support system and moral guidance.\n\nNow, let's weigh these factors. The arrest and conviction history is a strong indicator of higher risk. The substance use, especially recent use, adds to that risk. The mental health issues are also a concern, as they can contribute to impaired judgment and potentially lead to criminal behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, being enrolled in college and having employment suggests some level of stability and positive engagement. Living with both parents at a young age is generally protective.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would lean towards a higher risk prediction. The arrest history and recent substance use, combined with mental health issues, outweigh the protective factors like education and employment.\n\nFor confidence, I'd say 80%. There's a solid basis for predicting high risk, but there are also some positive elements that could indicate a lower risk if they are sufficiently supportive.\n\nSo, my JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\n",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
