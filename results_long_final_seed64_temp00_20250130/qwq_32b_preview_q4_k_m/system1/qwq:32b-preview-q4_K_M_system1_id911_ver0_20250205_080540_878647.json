    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old white male. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 22, which is young, and males in this age group can sometimes be at higher risk for certain behaviors, but that's a generalization. He's white, which might or might not be relevant depending on the context. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests maybe a minor run-in with the law, but no formal conviction is a positive sign.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and weighs 185 lbs. Physical attributes might not directly correlate with risk, unless we're considering specific types of crimes. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could potentially be a risk factor if isolation leads to certain behaviors, but it's not necessarily indicative of anything.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, but again, it's not definitive. He's held one job during the year, which is stable, another positive sign.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is great. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, so his abstention from drugs reduces that risk. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is also positive, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with risky behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of five. Stable family environment is generally protective against delinquency. He believes God has something to do with personal events, which might indicate a sense of morality or accountability that could deter criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, most of these factors seem to indicate low risk. He has a stable job, no recent drug use, no convictions, lived in a stable family environment, and doesn't report depression. The only potential red flag is living alone, but even that isn't typically a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with a confidence level of, say, 85%. That accounts for the fact that youth and single living might slightly elevate some risks, but overall, his profile suggests low likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
