    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a notable mark against his record. At 5'10\" and 140 lbs, he seems slim build-wise. Never married, living alone, which could indicate some level of independence or perhaps isolation. He has a high school diploma and is currently enrolled in a four-year college, which is positive in terms of education pursuit.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year, which might suggest stability or could be a red flag if that's his only employment record at 22. Drug use includes marijuana over the past four years, and recently, he's been feeling down, to the point where nothing could cheer him up. That sounds like signs of depression, which is important to note.\n\nLooking back, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. He also mentions that God plays a personal role in his life, which could indicate religious involvement or spirituality.\n\nFrom a risk assessment perspective, several factors come into play. The arrest and conviction are significant because they show past criminal behavior. However, the type of offense isn't specified, so it's hard to gauge its severity. His current educational status is positive, as is his enrollment in college, which suggests he's investing in his future.\n\nThe drug use, specifically marijuana, might be considered depending on local laws and the frequency of use. In some jurisdictions, marijuana use is decriminalized or legal, so this factor could vary in importance.\n\nHis mental health symptoms, particularly feeling down and nothing can cheer him up, are concerning. Depression can impact judgment and behavior, potentially leading to risky decisions or actions. It's crucial to consider whether he's receiving any mental health support.\n\nLiving alone at 22 isn't necessarily a risk factor, but it could indicate limited social support, which might be a consideration.\n\nOverall, while there are some red flags, like the arrest and conviction history and recent depressive symptoms, his educational pursuits and current employment suggest some level of stability and responsibility. Without more detailed information about the nature of the conviction and the extent of his drug use, it's challenging to make a definitive high-risk prediction.\n\nGiven the available data, I would lean towards a \"NO\" for high risk, but with a relatively low confidence score due to the uncertainty around the conviction and his mental health status.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
