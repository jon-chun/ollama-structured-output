    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is an 18-year-old white male, arrested once but not convicted. He's 6'1\", weighs 165 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED, not in college, had two jobs in the year, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't been depressed lately, grew up with both bio parents in an urban area of six people, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider what constitutes high risk in this context. Typically, in criminal justice risk assessment, high risk refers to the likelihood of reoffending or engaging in harmful behavior. So, I'll be looking at factors that are known to correlate with higher probabilities of such outcomes.\n\nLet's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: 18-year-old male. Research shows that young males are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities. So, this is a risk factor.\n\n2. **Race**: Identifies as White. Race alone isn't typically a risk factor, but it can interact with other variables. In this case, I'll consider it neutral unless combined with other factors.\n\n3. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested once but not convicted. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, so this is a mild indicator but not strongly predictive of future offenses.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes**: Height and weight seem normal for his age; no immediate red flags here.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk, as lack of social support may correlate with certain behaviors.\n\n6. **Education and Employment**: Has a GED, not in college, held two jobs in a year. Having a GED instead of a high school diploma might indicate some educational challenges, but holding down jobs is positive.\n\n7. **Substance Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or part of a pattern of substance abuse.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: Not depressed over the past month. This is positive, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with risky behaviors.\n\n9. **Family Background**: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of six. Stable family structure is generally protective, but living in an urban area could expose him to more criminal opportunities.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God influences personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against risky behaviors.\n\nNow, weighing these factors:\n\n- Positive factors: Living with both parents, not depressed, held jobs, religious beliefs.\n\n- Negative factors: Young male, arrest history, living alone, substance use, GED.\n\nOverall, there are both positive and negative factors present. The positive aspects, like stable family background and employment, counterbalance some of the risks associated with youth and substance use.\n\nGiven this mix, I wouldn't classify this individual as high risk. The protective factors seem to outweigh the risk factors, especially since there's no conviction history, he's employed, and has a supportive family background.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of, say, 75%. This accounts for the presence of some risk factors but emphasizes the protective elements in his profile.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
