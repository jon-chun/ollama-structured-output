    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a history of arrest but hasn't been convicted. That might mean she was charged but not found guilty or had charges dropped. This could indicate that she's less likely to have a criminal record, which might reduce her chances of reoffending or getting rearrested.\n\nShe is 19 years old, which is relatively young. Younger individuals might be more impulsive or less settled in their lives, potentially leading to higher risk factors like substance abuse or poor decision-making. However, she's married and living with her spouse, which could provide a stable environment that reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is a positive factor as it often correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to those without education. Not being in college might mean she's employed or pursuing other activities, which can contribute positively to her stability.\n\nShe's held two jobs this year, which shows responsibility and a capacity for consistent work. Employment usually indicates better financial stability and structure in life, both of which are protective factors against recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. A history of substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, so her clean record here is a positive sign.\n\nHowever, she has felt down during some parts of the month, indicating possible mental health issues or stress. Emotional instability can be a risk factor if it leads to poor coping mechanisms or increased criminal activity.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a young child. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which could increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her life might provide her with a sense of purpose and support, potentially reducing her risk of getting into trouble.\n\nPutting all this together, she has several protective factors like employment, education, marriage, and a clean drug record. However, there are some risks, such as her age and possible emotional issues. The presence of these protective factors might outweigh the potential risks, leading me to predict that she is less likely to be rearrested in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested but not convicted, indicating a lower likelihood of prior criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 19, she may be more susceptible to impulsive decisions due to youth\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs shows responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Being married provides a stable environment\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down could indicate stress but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior unless exacerbated\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose her to higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Belief in God might offer support and reduce risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
