    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior issues with the law, but since it wasn't a conviction, maybe her situation isn't as severe as someone with a history of convictions. I'm not sure how much weight to give this. Maybe medium because it shows some criminal history, but not a strong record.\n\nNext, she's 18 years old and female. Young age can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors, but females might have different rates compared to males. I think this is a medium factor since age itself isn't the highest risk, but being young does contribute.\n\nShe's living alone now. I wonder if living independently affects her situation. Maybe having a stable home could be protective, or maybe not having family around increases her exposure to negative influences. It's a bit unclear, so perhaps low because it might indicate some stability.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase involvement in criminal activities. This seems like a strong risk factor, so I'll give this a high weight.\n\nShe's held two jobs this year. Employment can be a protective factor as it provides structure and income. More job stability might reduce the likelihood of recidivism, so this is probably low.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Not using drugs could mean she's addressing substance issues or has moved away from that lifestyle. This is positive, so maybe medium because it shows some progress but not necessarily a strong protective factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health can influence criminal behavior. If she's not currently experiencing depression, it might be a protective factor, so I'll consider this as low since it's about current mental state.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household in an urban environment can have both positive and negative influences. It's a medium factor because urban environments often have higher crime rates, but having a family structure might provide some support.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal matters. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it provides moral support and community ties. Since she lacks this, it might increase her risk, so I'll give this a medium weight because the absence of such factors could contribute to higher recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risk factors are lack of education and being unconvicted but arrested once. The others seem less impactful. So overall, there's a moderate risk she might be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested before indicates some criminal history, though not a conviction\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate stability or exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment provides structure and income, potentially reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Not using drugs recently shows progress but doesn't guarantee low risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate good mental health or addressed issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with a single parent might have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Absence of religious beliefs could affect moral support and community ties\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
