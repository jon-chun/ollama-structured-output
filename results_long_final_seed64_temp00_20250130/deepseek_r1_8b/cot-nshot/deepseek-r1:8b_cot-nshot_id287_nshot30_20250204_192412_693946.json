    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have developed better decision-making skills or understanding of consequences. So, I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From the examples provided, it seems that race might play a role, but it's hard to tell if it's a significant factor on its own without more data. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction suggests he's had some formal involvement with the justice system, which could indicate higher risk. This seems like a high factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight between 175-199 lbs. Physical size might influence how he interacts in situations that lead to arrests. Maybe medium or low, but not sure if it's a strong indicator alone.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase risk. This seems like a high factor because without stability, it's harder to avoid negative influences.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can influence job opportunities and life choices, potentially reducing criminal behavior. So, this is probably a low factor.\n\nHe held two jobs last year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, which might lower the chance of recidivism. This seems like another low factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't necessarily predictive, but if he's been using recently, it could be a higher risk. Since he hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe his usage is less problematic now. Still, substance use is a medium factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so not being depressed might lower the risk. This is a low factor.\n\nAt 18, living with both parents in a household of size six in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more opportunities for negative activities. Also, having both parents might provide better support, but it's still an urban setting which could be medium to high.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior, potentially reducing criminal activity. This is a low factor.\n\nPutting this all together, the strongest factors are prior conviction (high), living alone (high), and possibly substance use (medium). The rest seem less influential. So, overall, I think there's a medium risk he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race might play a role but data is unclear\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction indicates formal justice involvement\"),\n    (\"physical_size\", \"medium\", \"Physical size may influence interactions leading to arrests\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone may increase risk without supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Education level can reduce criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment provides stability and reduces crime\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent substance use could be a factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed might lower risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Urban environment and family support mix\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can influence behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
