    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider that as a medium risk because while they might be more likely, it's not extremely high yet.\n\nNext, race: he's Black. Looking at the examples, Black individuals had mixed outcomes, but sometimes higher recidivism rates compared to others. This is tricky, so maybe medium risk here too.\n\nArrest history: two arrests, no convictions. From the data, having been arrested before increases the risk. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, it's a bit of a gray area. Maybe medium risk because it shows some prior issues but not a conviction that would definitely predict recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and between 175-199 lbs. Being taller might reduce the likelihood of being rearrested due to physical size sometimes playing a role in avoiding conflicts. So, I'll assign this as low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. From examples, those who are single or not married had varying outcomes, but sometimes higher rates because they might have less support systems. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being in college could mean lower educational constraints, possibly leading to more issues. So, maybe medium risk.\n\nEmployment: held 3 jobs this year. Stable employment can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of getting into trouble again. This seems like a strong positive indicator, so I'll assign it as low risk.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in four years. Not using drugs is a big plus because substance abuse is a major driver for recidivism. So, this is definitely a low risk factor.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so if he's not experiencing it now, that's protective. Low risk here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Larger households might provide more support, which is positive. So, low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has something to do with his life. Religion can be a protective factor, providing moral support and reducing criminal behavior. This is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that stand out as positive are employment, no drug use, mental health, household size, and religion. The negative factors are age, race, arrest history, and education level. Overall, despite some risks, the positives seem stronger.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals sometimes show higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested before increases risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Taller and heavier individuals may avoid conflicts more easily\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single or not married can lead to less support systems\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not enrolled in college might reduce protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use significantly reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression can be protective\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger households provide more support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
