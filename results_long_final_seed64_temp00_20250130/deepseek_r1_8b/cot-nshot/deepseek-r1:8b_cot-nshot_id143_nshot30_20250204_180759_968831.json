    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. For example, in Example 26, an 18-year-old had a \"YES\" outcome. So I'll assign this a high weight because being young and likely to engage in risky behavior increases the chance of rearrest.\n\nNext, she's White. Looking at the examples, there wasn't a clear pattern based on race, but some factors like living alone or having a criminal history might be more influential. Maybe race isn't as significant here, so I'll give this a low weight.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. From Example 1 and others, prior arrest without conviction doesn't always lead to recidivism, but it does indicate some involvement with the legal system. This could mean she's more likely to reoffend, so I'll assign medium weight.\n\nHer height is 5'7\" and weight is 155 lbs. Body size isn't directly mentioned in the examples as a factor, but being of average build doesn't inherently increase or decrease risk. So low weight here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. From Example 26 again, living alone can be a risk factor because it might lead to more opportunities for criminal behavior without accountability. This seems significant, so high weight.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree but isn't enrolled in college now. Higher education can sometimes deter crime, but since she's not currently in college, maybe the deterrent effect is lessened. Still, having a degree could indicate better life choices, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nShe held four jobs last year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this is a positive indicator, leading me to assign low weight.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism. Even if she hasn't been convicted, substance abuse increases the risk of further arrests. High weight here.\n\nShe felt down sometimes in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. Feeling down could indicate stress or instability, which might lead to recidivism. Medium weight.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable home environment is protective against crime. However, she's now living alone, which might be a risk factor. Since her current situation is different, maybe the protective effect isn't as strong. Still, having a stable upbringing could mitigate some risks, so low weight.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Religiosity can influence behavior; believing in a higher power might deter crime. Without this belief, there's less inhibition, so high weight.\n\nPutting it all together: high for age, high for drug use, high for living alone, medium for prior arrest, medium for feeling down, low for education and stable upbringing, low for race and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"no clear pattern indicating race as a significant factor\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"arrest without conviction may indicate legal system involvement\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"not directly related to recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"high\", \"living alone can increase opportunities for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"higher education may deter crime, but not currently in college\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"stable employment reduces criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"feeling down may indicate instability leading to crime\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing provides protection, but current situation has changed\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"absence of belief in higher power may reduce inhibitions\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
