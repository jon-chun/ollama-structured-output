    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That suggests she might have some criminal history or at least a tendency to engage in behavior that leads to arrests. I'm not sure if having prior arrests without convictions is as significant as having actual convictions. Maybe it's a medium risk because it shows some pattern of behavior, but not necessarily a strong history.\n\nNext, her weight and height are 5 feet 0 inches and 145 lbs. I don't see how physical attributes directly relate to recidivism. It might be more about her mental state or environment rather than her physical build. So maybe this factor is low in terms of risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone now. Living alone could mean she doesn't have the support system that might help her stay out of trouble, which might increase her risk. Being single might also mean she has more time or fewer responsibilities that keep her occupied, potentially leading to more criminal activities. I think this is a medium factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive because it often correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to those without education. But not being in college might mean she's not pursuing further education or training, which could be a risk factor. So maybe this is low since having a diploma is a good sign.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it can lead to financial stress and more time for criminal activities. Without a job, she might have more free time or feel disconnected from society, which could increase her likelihood of being rearrested. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but was feeling down most of the time last month. Her mental health seems to be a concern here. Depression can lead to criminal behavior as a way to cope with emotions. Even though she's not using drugs now, her emotional state is a red flag. This is probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area when she was young. Growing up in a large family might provide some support, but being in an urban environment can expose her to more crime and negative influences. However, since she's now living alone, the current environment is just her. Maybe this factor is medium because while the upbringing isn't ideal, her current situation could be more challenging.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This might indicate she has a strong sense of purpose or someone she's answering to, which could influence her behavior. It might give her a reason to avoid criminal activity, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors seem to be her mental health and unemployment. Her lack of employment increases her risk, and her depression is another major concern. The arrests without convictions also show some history of behavior that could lead to further issues. The rest of the factors are less impactful compared to these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has a history of arrests, indicating potential behavioral patterns\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment can lead to financial stress and increased criminal activity\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a positive factor, reducing recidivism risk compared to those without\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and large family background may expose her to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power may provide motivation to avoid criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
