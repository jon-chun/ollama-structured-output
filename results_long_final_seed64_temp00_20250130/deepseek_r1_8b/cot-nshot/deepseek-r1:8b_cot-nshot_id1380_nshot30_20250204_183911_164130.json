    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have developed better decision-making skills or coping mechanisms. So, I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From the examples provided, it seems that race might play a role, but it's not clear if being White increases or decreases the likelihood. In some cases, White individuals had outcomes like \"NO\" and others like \"YES.\" It's a bit mixed, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of future rearrests. People with such records are more likely to reoffend due to criminal tendencies or limited opportunities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHis weight is 135 lbs., which isn't specified as relevant, but overall health could affect behavior. However, without specific information on how it ties to recidivism, I'll consider it low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he lacks supervision or support, which can increase the chances of engaging in criminal activities. This is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities for survival. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs this year. Unemployment, especially among young males, can lead to higher recidivism as they might resort to criminal behavior for income. Another high risk factor.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Drug use itself isn't always a predictor of future crimes, but combined with other factors like unemployment and arrests, it could increase the risk. This is medium.\n\nHe felt down during the past month, indicating possible mental health issues. Depression or emotional instability can lead to poor decision-making and criminal behavior. So, this is another high risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both parents in a rural area as a child. Growing up in a stable environment might have provided better support, but since he's now facing these issues, it could mean he didn't receive adequate support then. This might be low or medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his life. Lack of religious or spiritual beliefs isn't directly tied to recidivism, so this is probably low.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk factors are arrest history, lack of education, unemployment, and current drug use. Medium risks include age, living situation, and recent depression. Low risks are race, weight, and belief in God.\n\nSo, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Mixed outcomes in examples provided\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Convictions indicate ongoing issues\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of supervision may increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent use may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression can affect decision-making\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing might have helped\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Not directly linked to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
