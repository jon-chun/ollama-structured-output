    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested. For instance, in Example 26, a 19-year-old was rearrested, and others around that age had higher recidivism rates. So I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, race is White. Looking at the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes, but it didn't seem to be as strong a predictor as other factors like age or criminal history. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested 5 times and convicted. From the examples, higher numbers of arrests and convictions correlated with rearrests. So this is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nWeight: He's between 200-224 lbs. In the examples, heavier individuals were more likely to be rearrested. Example 26 had someone around that weight who was rearrested. So medium weight here.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From the data, being single didn't seem to directly correlate with recidivism, but sometimes it did. Maybe low weight since it's not a strong indicator either way.\n\nLiving situation: Lives alone. In some examples, living alone was associated with higher recidivism because there's less supervision or accountability. So medium weight here.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED. From the data, lacking education was a significant factor in rearrests. Example 26 and others showed that without education, it's harder to find stable employment, leading to more criminal activity. High weight here.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job this year. Having any employment is better than none, but only one job doesn't indicate stability. From the examples, consistent or multiple jobs were better predictors. So maybe low weight since it's not strong.\n\nDrug use: No recent drug use. In some cases, substance abuse was a factor in recidivism, but here he hasn't used drugs recently. This could be protective, so medium weight.\n\nMental health: Not mentioned, but if he has issues, it might increase risk. Since it's not provided, I'll assume no issue or low weight.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3. Smaller households might provide less support, increasing risk. So medium weight here.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God's influence. From the examples, religious beliefs sometimes protected against recidivism, so without them, higher risk. Medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are age and criminal history, each high-weighted. The next significant is education, also high. Living alone and household size are medium. Employment and drug use are low. Race is medium but not as strong as others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals had mixed outcomes\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Higher arrest and conviction history correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Heavier individuals were more likely to be rearrested\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not a strong indicator either way\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having any job is better than none, but not strongly predictive\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"No recent drug use could be protective\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Smaller households may provide less support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's influence increases risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
