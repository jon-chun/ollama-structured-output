    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested. For instance, in example #26, a 19-year-old was rearrested, and others around that age had higher recidivism rates. So I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. Looking at the examples, there's no clear pattern based on ethnicity alone. Some Hispanics were rearrested (like example #29), while others weren't. Maybe it's not as significant as other factors, so I'll assign it a medium weight.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested 4 times and convicted. From the examples, higher arrest counts often led to recidivism. For example, someone with 3 arrests (example #28) was rearrested. So this is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nWeight: He's between 200-224 lbs. Being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher criminal activity rates, but in the examples provided, weight didn't seem directly related to recidivism. Maybe it's a low or medium factor. I'll go with medium since being heavier might contribute to health issues that could lead to more antisocial behavior.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From the examples, being single didn't always predict recidivism. Some singles were rearrested (like example #26), while others weren't. It's a bit inconsistent, so I'll give it a medium weight.\n\nEmployment: He held 2 jobs this year. Employment can be protective against crime. In the examples, those with jobs sometimes were rearrested, but it wasn't a strong indicator either way. Maybe medium weight here as well.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Examples show that drug users often had higher recidivism rates (like example #29). So this should be high weight.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, but without knowing if he has other mental health problems, it's hard to assess. Maybe low weight since he's not showing signs of depression now.\n\nFamily structure: Lived with both parents as a child. Stable family backgrounds sometimes reduce recidivism, but in the examples, some from stable families were rearrested (like example #26). It's mixed, so medium weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has influence over his life. Religion can be protective or sometimes used to justify behavior. In the examples, it didn't seem directly related, so maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together, the strongest factors are age and arrest history, both high-weight. Drug use is also a significant factor, high-weight. The other factors are medium or lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates as seen in examples\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone doesn't strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Overweight may contribute to behavior related issues\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single status can be both protective and risky\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job holding shows potential stability but mixed results\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression signs, but other issues unknown\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Stable family may reduce recidivism but not always\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs don't consistently predict behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
