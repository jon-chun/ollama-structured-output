    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. For instance, in example #26, a 19-year-old had a \"YES\" outcome. So I'll assign this a high weight because being young and male can be a significant risk factor.\n\nNext, race is White. Looking at the examples, it seems that White individuals have mixed outcomes. In some cases, they were rearrested (\"YES\"), while others weren't. It doesn't seem to consistently predict recidivism on its own, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. From the data, prior convictions often correlate with higher recidivism rates. For example, in example #1, someone with a prior conviction was rearrested. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and between 225-249 lbs. Being heavier can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not directly linked to recidivism. However, in example #29, someone who used drugs was rearrested, so substance use is a bigger factor here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is not living alone. From the examples, living alone doesn't seem to impact recidivism much. Being single might be a medium risk since it could affect supervision or support systems.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Having an education certificate can sometimes indicate lower recidivism rates because it suggests some structure in his life. But without further education, he might face more challenges, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe held one job this year. Employment can be stabilizing, but only having one job might not be enough to reduce risk significantly. It's a positive factor, so I'll give it a low weight.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism. In several examples, drug use led to rearrests (\"YES\"). This is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can both increase and decrease recidivism depending on the context. Without current depression, it might slightly reduce risk, so low weight here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Family structure and living conditions can influence behavior. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, which could be a medium factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be protective, but it's not clear how this specific belief affects recidivism. It might be a low factor since it's less directly tied to behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are prior conviction and substance use, both high-weight. The age is also significant. The other factors like employment and mental health have lower weights. So overall, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals had mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Being heavier is not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may increase risk through supervision challenges\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without further education could pose challenges\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment is stabilizing but only one job might not be enough\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression may reduce risk slightly\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban and two-parent household could influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is less directly tied to behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
