    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. From the examples given, it seems that age plays a role in recidivism. Younger individuals might have higher rates because they've had less time to establish stable lives. She's 20, which is on the younger side, so I'd consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHer criminal history shows she's been arrested once but not convicted. From the examples, prior arrests seem to influence recidivism. Having an arrest record might increase the chance of future rearrests, especially if there's a pattern. So, this is another medium factor.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 134 lbs. Body size isn't directly mentioned in the examples, but physical health can affect behavior and decision-making. If she's overweight, it might contribute to stress or other issues that could lead to criminal behavior again. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. From the examples, being single and living alone sometimes correlates with higher recidivism because there might be less supervision or support. However, in some cases, independence can also be a protective factor. I think this is medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level affects employment opportunities and life stability. Having a diploma is positive, but not attending college could mean she's not building further skills or income, which might increase the risk of getting into trouble again. This seems like a medium factor.\n\nShe held two jobs this year. Employment can be a strong protective factor as it provides structure and income. Two jobs indicate some stability, so this is probably low to medium. I'll lean towards low since having multiple jobs might show more responsibility.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and feels down sometimes. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Marijuana use alone isn't as severe as other drugs, but it can contribute to criminal behavior. Her feeling down could indicate stress or instability, which might lead to further issues. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3. Family structure can influence recidivism. Growing up in a single-parent household might have its challenges, but it's not as strongly associated with crime as, say, being in foster care or multiple changes. So, this is probably low to medium. I'll go with low since she had some family support.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her life. Religiosity can be a protective factor by promoting values and reducing criminal behavior. If she's religious, it might lower her chances of rearrest. This seems like a high risk factor because strong beliefs can reduce recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks are drug use and her belief system. The lowest is her physical health. So, I'll assign weights accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher rates of criminal behavior due to less stability in their lives\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest increases the likelihood of future rearrests, especially if there's a pattern\"),\n    (\"physical_health\", \"low\", \"Overall health can influence behavior and decision-making\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might increase risks due to lack of supervision or support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Not attending college may limit job opportunities, increasing the risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides stability, which can reduce the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant factor in recidivism and can lead to further criminal activity\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a single-parent household has some challenges but isn't as strongly linked to crime as other factors\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Strong beliefs can promote values and reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
