    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested. For instance, in example #26, an 18-year-old was predicted a \"YES.\" So, I'll give this a high weight because being young and having a history of arrests increases the risk.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. Looking at the examples, there's no direct correlation mentioned for ethnicity, but it's often a factor in recidivism studies. Since the person identifies as Hispanic, I'll consider it medium weight because it might influence behavior patterns or systemic issues.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested 5 times and convicted. From the examples, frequent arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism. For example, someone with multiple arrests (like in example #26) was more likely to be rearrested. So, this is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nPhysical build: 5'5\" and between 150-174 lbs. I'm not sure how physical build directly affects recidivism, but being within that weight range might indicate higher muscle mass or strength, which could be associated with higher risk behaviors. However, without clear data from examples, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From the examples, being single doesn't seem to have a direct impact either way. For example, some singles were rearrested (like in #26), and others weren't. So, this is probably a low-weight factor.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone. In the examples, living alone didn't seem to affect recidivism much. Some lived alone and were rearrested, while others did too but weren't. So, I'll also give this a low weight.\n\nEducation: He has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. From the examples, having education (like a GED) sometimes was a factor, but not necessarily predictive of recidivism on its own. Since he's not in college, maybe it's a slight negative factor, so medium weight.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job this year. In the examples, employment sometimes reduced recidivism risk. For example, someone with a job (like #29) was less likely to be rearrested. So, having a job is positive, but only one might not be enough, so maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. From examples, drug use, especially recent, seems to increase recidivism risk. For instance, someone who used drugs was more likely to be rearrested (like #29). So, this is a high-weight factor because ongoing substance abuse is a strong predictor.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed recently. In the examples, mental health issues sometimes contributed to recidivism, but without current issues, it's less of a factor. So, low weight.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological dad in a household of 5. From examples, family structure can influence behavior. A larger household might provide more support or supervision, which could reduce risk. So, this is a positive factor, giving it medium weight because family support can deter recidivism.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God involved in his life. In the examples, religious beliefs sometimes were protective factors (like #29), so this is another positive influence. I'll give it medium weight as well.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weights are arrest history and drug use, both high. Then, family background and education are medium. The rest are low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may influence behavior patterns\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Unclear impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Single status doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't consistently predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without further education may be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism but one job might not suffice\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current mental health issues reported\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Supportive family structure can deter recidivism\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs may provide protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
