    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age is a significant factor because younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates compared to older adults. So I think that's a medium risk there.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, which could be a risk factor for future rearrests. Maybe medium here as well.\n\nHis height is 5'11\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. I'm not sure how physical build directly affects recidivism, but being in that weight range isn't necessarily protective or risky on its own. Maybe low impact here.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently not living alone. Living arrangements can influence behavior. Not living alone might mean more supervision or support, which could reduce the risk of rearrest. So perhaps medium to low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities and life stability, both of which are protective against crime. Since he's not in college, maybe that's a slight negative, so medium impact.\n\nHe held 1 job this year. Employment is generally a positive factor as it provides structure and income, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. One job might be minimal, but it's better than nothing, so low to medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Not using drugs recently could lower his chances, so that's a positive factor with high impact.\n\nSome days he feels down and can't be cheered up. Depression or emotional issues can lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism. This might increase the risk, so medium impact.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Family support can be protective, but being in an urban environment often has higher crime rates. The family structure is positive, but the location is negative. Maybe medium overall.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Religiosity can influence behavior; without it, there might be less guidance or moral framework, increasing risk. So high impact here.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the factors that stand out are prior arrest (medium), education level (medium), employment (low to medium), drug use absence (high positive), emotional issues (medium), family support (medium positive), and lack of religion (high negative).\n\nConsidering these, it's a mix. On one hand, he has some protective factors like employment and no recent drug use. On the other, he lacks religious guidance and has some emotional struggles. The prior arrest is a concern, but not a conviction might be less impactful.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so maybe medium confidence in predicting a YES for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history indicates potential for further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build alone has minimal impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide support, reducing rearrest risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is protective but not enrolled in college is a slight negative\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment provides structure and reduces crime risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"emotional_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"medium\", \"Family support is protective, but urban environment has higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious belief may increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
