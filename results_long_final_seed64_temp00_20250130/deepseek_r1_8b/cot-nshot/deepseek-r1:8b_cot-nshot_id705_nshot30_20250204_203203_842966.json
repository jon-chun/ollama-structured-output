    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. For instance, in Example 26, a 19-year-old had some factors but still ended up with a \"YES\". So I'll give this a high weight because being young and male is a strong indicator.\n\nNext, race is White. Looking at the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes. Some were rearrested (\"YES\"), others weren't. It doesn't seem as significant as age or criminal history, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. From the data, prior arrest without conviction seems to slightly increase risk, but not as much as a criminal record. So I'll assign this a medium weight because it shows he has some involvement with the justice system.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 165 lbs. These don't directly relate to recidivism, so I can consider them low impact factors.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. From the examples, being single or not living alone doesn't seem to affect recidivism much. So this factor gets a low weight.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which could be a risk factor. However, since he's holding a job, it might mitigate that. I'll give this a medium weight because education level can influence future decisions.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Job stability seems to have a positive effect. People with jobs are less likely to reoffend. So this is a strong protective factor and should be weighted high.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is great. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk. This gets a high weight.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates. If he's not currently experiencing depression, that's a positive sign. But since it's only about the past month, I'm unsure how much weight to give this. Maybe medium because it's a temporary state.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 as a young adult. Larger households might provide more support or supervision, which could reduce recidivism. So this is another protective factor and should be weighted high.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his life outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. People with strong religious beliefs are less likely to reoffend. This gets a high weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors are age (high), prior arrest (medium), job stability (high), no drug use (high), household size (high), and religiosity (high). The factors like education level, living situation, and mental health have lower weights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals had mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction slightly increases risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not married and not living alone doesn't significantly affect risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive but not enrolled in college may be a risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Job stability is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed is positive but temporary\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Larger households provide more support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Strong beliefs can reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
