    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That suggests she might have some criminal history or at least a tendency to engage in behavior that leads to arrests. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it's unclear if she has a significant criminal record.\n\nShe identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, which is an ethnic factor. I'm not sure how relevant ethnicity plays into recidivism, but maybe it relates to socioeconomic factors or community support systems.\n\nHer age is 19, which is relatively young. Younger individuals might have higher rates of impulsive behavior, which could contribute to further arrests.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but if there are issues in the relationship, it might not provide as much support. However, without knowing the nature of their relationship, it's hard to assess its impact on recidivism.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase socioeconomic stress, which might lead to criminal behavior again.\n\nShe held only one job last year. Job instability could be a risk factor as it may contribute to financial difficulties, which in turn can lead to criminal activity.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it often leads to criminal charges and can create a cycle of addiction and further arrests.\n\nShe reported feeling down or depressed at times during the past month. Depression can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including criminal ones.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size three in a rural area. Growing up in a small household might have provided some level of supervision but could also mean limited resources or exposure to negative influences.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate a reliance on religious or spiritual factors, which might influence her behavior positively or negatively depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, it seems like having a criminal history (even if not convicted), drug use, and lack of education are significant factors leading to \"YES\" predictions. Her situation mirrors some of these factors: two arrests, recent drug use, no high school diploma, job instability, and possible emotional issues.\n\nI need to assign weights to each factor. From the examples, factors like criminal history (arrests) and drug use were given medium or high weight. Education was also a significant factor. So I'll consider:\n\n- Arrests: Medium\n- Drug Use: High\n- Education: High\n- Job Stability: Medium\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Depression: Medium\n- Household Size: Low\n- Ethnicity: Low\n- Faith: Low\n\nBased on these weights, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Faith\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
