    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less likely to understand the consequences or have better decision-making skills. So I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From the examples provided, it seems that race might not directly correlate with recidivism, but socioeconomic factors associated with race could play a role. Without more info, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest can sometimes indicate higher risk of future arrests, especially if there were underlying issues that led to the arrest. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight is 230 lbs. Being overweight or obese can contribute to health issues which might lead to criminal behavior or poor decision-making. This could be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he lacks the support system that could help him stay out of trouble, increasing his risk. This is probably medium.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive, but not attending college can indicate lower educational goals, which might be linked to higher recidivism. So this is medium.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment can provide structure and reduce criminal behavior, so having only one job might not be as protective as more stable employment. This could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a strong indicator of future issues unless there are other factors like addiction or prior convictions. Since he hasn't been convicted for drug offenses, this is probably low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, but without current symptoms, it's hard to assess. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 2 in a rural area. Non-traditional living arrangements might have contributed to his environment, possibly increasing his risk. This is likely high.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior, but without knowing how it's been applied, it's unclear. Maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks seem to be living situation and weight. The lowest are race, no prior conviction, and not feeling depressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race might not directly correlate with recidivism but can be influenced by socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest indicates potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"high\", \"Overweight or obesity can lead to health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of support system increases risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not enrolled in college may indicate lower educational goals\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment provides structure, though one job might not be as protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions for drug offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"high\", \"Non-traditional living may have contributed to environment\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religiosity's impact is unclear without more info\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
