    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider that as a medium risk because while they're more likely, it's not the highest among all factors.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. In the examples, some Hispanic individuals had outcomes like \"YES\" and others \"NO.\" It seems inconsistent, so maybe low to medium. I'm leaning towards medium since there's no clear trend but some cases show higher risk.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. From the data, a prior conviction seems significant. In examples, those with convictions had higher recidivism rates. So, this is definitely high risk.\n\nWeight at 260 lbs. Obesity is linked to higher criminal behavior in some studies, so I'll consider that as medium risk because it's a contributing factor but not the most impactful alone.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From examples, being single can increase recidivism, especially for men. So, this is high risk.\n\nLiving alone: In the data, living alone sometimes correlated with higher recidivism. It might be medium to high because it's a social factor that could influence behavior.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma. Education is usually protective, so this should lower the risk. Maybe low to medium.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job. Having any employment can be stabilizing, but only one job might not be as strong as being employed consistently. So, maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down sometimes. Current or recent drug use is a significant risk factor. This should be high because substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior recurrence.\n\nMental health: He felt down sometimes, indicating possible depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so this is medium to high.\n\nHousehold structure: Lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3. Larger households might provide more support, but since he's now living alone, it could be less supportive. Maybe low to medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his life. Religion can be protective, so this is low to medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors are prior conviction (high), current drug use (high), and possibly being single and living alone (high). The other factors like age, ethnicity, education, employment, mental health, and religion are less impactful but still contribute. So overall, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Inconsistent correlation in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction is significant\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity linked to higher behavior risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Single increases risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Social factor influencing behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Protective factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Stabilizing but limited impact\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current use is significant\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Possible depression affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"household_structure\", \"low\", \"Larger household support, now alone\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
