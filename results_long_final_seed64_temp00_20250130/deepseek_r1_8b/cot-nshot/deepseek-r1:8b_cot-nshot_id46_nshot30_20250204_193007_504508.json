    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider that as a medium risk because while they might be more likely, it's not extremely high yet.\n\nNext, race: he's White. Looking at the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes, but nothing stands out as particularly higher or lower. Maybe this is a low factor since there wasn't a clear trend favoring one race over another in recidivism.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. From the data, prior arrest without conviction seems to slightly increase risk, so I'll rate that as medium. It's better than having no arrests, but not as significant as multiple convictions.\n\nHis weight is 287 lbs., which is on the higher side. Obesity is linked to higher recidivism rates due to health issues and lower self-esteem. So, this could be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Single status can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates because of social isolation or financial instability. This might be medium risk since it's a common situation but not inherently criminal.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high risk. Education is linked to better job prospects and lower crime rates.\n\nHe held one job this year. Having employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior by providing structure and income. So, this might be low or medium. Since he only has one job, it's not extensive enough to significantly lower his risk, so maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor; abstinence here could lower recidivism risk. This should be a high positive factor, but since I'm focusing on negative factors for recidivism, this might not apply directly. However, it's a protective factor, so maybe low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues are linked to higher crime rates. If he's not currently depressed, that's a positive sign. So, this could be a low risk factor since mental instability isn't a current issue.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household and in an urban environment can increase exposure to crime and stress, so this is likely medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his life. Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior. Without strong religious beliefs, this might be a high risk factor since it removes one potential protective mechanism.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are lack of education and being White (though race didn't show a clear trend). Obesity and single living also contribute. The lowest factors are employment and no recent depression.\n\nSo, considering these, I think there's a medium to high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals didn't show a clear trend in recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction slightly increases risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"high\", \"Obesity is linked to higher recidivism due to health issues\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single status can increase crime rates due to isolation\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having one job may not significantly lower risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"not_applicable\", \"Abstinence is protective but not directly relevant here\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed is positive\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and single-parent household increase exposure to crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
