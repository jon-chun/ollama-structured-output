    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less likely to understand the consequences or have better decision-making skills. So I'll consider that a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. From the examples provided, being part of a minority group seems to correlate with higher recidivism, so that's another high factor.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. A history of arrests can indicate higher likelihood of future criminal behavior, especially if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of support. So this is probably medium to high.\n\nHis weight is 230 lbs., which might be on the heavier side. Obesity or being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher rates of substance abuse or other behavioral issues, so that's a possible factor. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone without support might increase the chances of engaging in risky behaviors, so that could be medium.\n\nHe is enrolled in school. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism, so this is a positive sign. That would likely lower the risk, maybe to low or medium.\n\nHe held two jobs last year. Employment can also be a protective factor as it provides structure and income, reducing criminal behavior. So that's another positive, perhaps lowering the risk further.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Current or past substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Since he hasn't used it recently, maybe this is medium to low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. If he's not currently experiencing depression, that might lower the risk compared to someone who is. So perhaps low or medium.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size five. Growing up in a single-parent family can have both positive and negative effects. It might provide some support but also potential stressors. I'm not sure how much weight to give this, maybe medium.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity or belief in a higher power can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior by providing moral guidance. So that's another positive factor, perhaps lowering the risk.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like age and race are high risks. Arrest history is medium. Employment and not using drugs recently are positives, so they might lower the overall risk. His mental health and religious beliefs could also mitigate some of these risks.\n\nSo, considering all these, I think his recidivism risk is moderate. There's a decent chance he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals often have higher rates of recidivism due to immaturity and lack of decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Minority groups, including Black individuals, often have higher recidivism rates as per the provided examples\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: A history of arrests indicates potential for future criminal behavior, especially if underlying issues persist\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher rates of substance abuse or behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone without support may increase engagement in risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Enrollment in school is a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding jobs provides structure and income, reducing criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent marijuana use indicates potential for ongoing behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Not currently feeling depressed may lower risk compared to those experiencing mental health issues\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a single-parent household can have mixed effects on behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
