    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. From the examples given, age seems to play a role, but it's hard to tell if younger or older individuals are more likely to reoffend. Maybe I'll consider this a medium risk since age is a common factor but doesn't alone determine recidivism.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a criminal history increases the likelihood of future arrests. Looking at the examples, those with prior convictions were more likely to reoffend. So, this seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHer weight is 130 lbs., which is on the higher side. Body weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, but being overweight can sometimes be associated with other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which might contribute to criminal behavior. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she lacks the structure and supervision that a family environment could provide. From the examples, those not living alone had higher recidivism rates, so this is another high-risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor. Many studies show that lower educational attainment is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a very high-risk factor.\n\nShe held three jobs this year. Employment can be stabilizing, but if she's working while using drugs, it might not provide the same level of stability. However, having a job shows some initiative, so I'll consider this a low risk.\n\nShe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism. From the examples, substance abuse was a consistent high-risk factor. Her current feelings of sadness or depression might indicate ongoing issues that could lead to further criminal behavior, making this a very high risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3. Family support can be protective, but if she's dealing with substance abuse or other issues at home, it might not provide enough support. This is a medium risk since family structure alone isn't determinative.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Religiosity can influence behavior, and lack of belief might contribute to higher recidivism. From the examples, those without religious ties had higher rates, so this is another high-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest predictors are prior conviction (high), substance abuse (high), lack of education (high), and lack of religious beliefs (high). These factors likely outweigh others like employment and household size.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Age is a common factor in recidivism studies, but its impact varies by individual circumstances.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: A prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Higher weight may be associated with other risk factors like substance abuse\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone can contribute to higher recidivism due to lack of supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Employment shows initiative, which can be stabilizing\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Current and past drug use are significant risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Larger households may offer more support, but this case involves a small household\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of religious beliefs can contribute to higher recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
