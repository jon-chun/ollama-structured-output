    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a history of arrest but hasn't been convicted. That might mean she was charged but not found guilty or had charges dropped. This could indicate that she's at higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nShe's 19 years old and living alone now. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors, which might lead to further arrests. However, she's enrolled in college, which is a positive factor. So maybe the age part leans towards medium, but her current situation might balance it out.\n\nHer weight is 190 lbs., which is on the heavier side. I'm not sure how this directly affects arrest risk, but being overweight can sometimes be associated with health issues or other behaviors that might lead to legal trouble. Maybe medium here as well.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Independence might mean she has more freedom, which could increase her chances of getting into situations leading to arrests. This seems like a medium factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education is a strong positive indicator, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. This should be given a high weight because education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe held one job this year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, which might reduce the chances of getting into trouble. So another high factor here.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Not using drugs is a positive sign, as drug use is a common cause for arrests. This should be medium because it's a recent change but not necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so if she's not currently experiencing depression, that's a positive sign. Maybe medium here as well.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support, which could reduce her risk compared to someone from a single-parent home or a smaller family. So this is another medium factor.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate she has strong beliefs or faith, which might influence her behavior positively. Beliefs can play a role in decision-making, so I'll give this a low weight since it's less directly tied to criminal history.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors related to education and employment are high because they're strong protective factors. The arrest history is medium, as it shows some risk. Living situation and household size are also medium positives. Not using drugs and not feeling depressed are medium negatives. Age and weight don't have a clear impact, so I'll assign them low.\n\nSo the prediction would lean towards \"NO\" because the positive factors like education and employment outweigh the negative ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age might be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Being overweight can sometimes correlate with health issues or other behaviors leading to legal trouble\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might increase exposure to situations leading to arrests\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrollment in college are strong protective factors\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Held one job, providing financial stability and structure\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Not using drugs in the past four years is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month is a positive sign\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with her biological mother in a household of five, which might provide support\"),\n    (\"Religious or Belief Factors\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence, potentially influencing behavior positively\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
