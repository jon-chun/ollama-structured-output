    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who's been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, her demographic info: she's White, 5'4\", 120 lbs. She's never married and lives alone. Not having a high school diploma or GED might be a risk factor because education is linked to lower recidivism. She's working three jobs, which is positive, but past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the last four years could increase her risk.\n\nHer mental state: she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good. But she believes in God having a personal role in her life, which might influence her behavior positively or negatively depending on how she interprets it.\n\nShe has a history of arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk. She's young, 22, so age is another factor\u2014youthful offenders often have higher rates.\n\nLooking at the factors:\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n2. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED is a medium to high risk since education can reduce criminal behavior.\n3. **Employment**: She's working three jobs, which is positive but might not outweigh her past drug use and arrests.\n4. **Drug Use**: Recent drug history is a significant factor\u2014high risk.\n5. **Mental Health (Depression)**: She hasn't felt depressed recently, so this could be low or medium.\n6. **Religious Beliefs**: This could be either positive or negative; without more info, it's hard to assess, maybe medium.\n7. **Living Situation**: Living alone might not directly correlate with recidivism but could influence decisions.\n\nConsidering all these, the highest risks are age and drug use. Her employment is a positive, which might mitigate some risk, but her past behavior and lack of education are strong indicators. I'm leaning towards high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful offenders often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is linked to increased criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates better mental health\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence may either positively or negatively impact behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
