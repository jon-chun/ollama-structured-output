    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's White, 6'0\", 170 lbs. That doesn't immediately stand out as a high risk factor on its own. Being White isn't inherently risky. His weight and height are within the average range, so probably low or medium.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 could be a bit of a red flag because it might indicate he's not in a supportive environment, which can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors. But I'm not sure if that's a high factor or just medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is often a protective factor. Having a GED and going to college suggests he's motivated and less likely to engage in criminal activities, so this might be low risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a strong indicator of stability. Having a job shows responsibility and structure, which reduces the likelihood of recidivism. So that's probably a low factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is a common risk factor, but since he's not currently using and isn't depressed, it might be less of a concern. However, prior use still counts as medium risk because it indicates some history of risky behavior.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his life personally. Religiosity can play a role in reducing criminal behavior, so if he's secular, that might increase the risk slightly. But without more info on his involvement or beliefs, I'd say it's low.\n\nHis family background: lived with his biological dad in an urban area with a household of five. Growing up in a large urban family could expose him to different influences, but it doesn't necessarily mean high risk unless there were other issues like criminality in the family, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, I think each factor is either low or medium. The prediction would lean towards \"NO\" because several protective factors are present, like education and employment. Confidence isn't super high because some risk factors are present, but they might not be significant enough to lead to recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: His age, gender, race, height, weight, marital status, and living situation do not significantly contribute to criminal risk factors.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: His high school diploma and enrollment in a 2-year college indicate a positive trajectory that reduces criminal risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding one job demonstrates responsibility and stability, which are protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Past marijuana use is a moderate risk factor, but the lack of current depression suggests it may not be as significant\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: His secular views do not inherently increase criminal risk, though it slightly reduces protective factors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large urban household is a moderate risk factor but not inherently high\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
