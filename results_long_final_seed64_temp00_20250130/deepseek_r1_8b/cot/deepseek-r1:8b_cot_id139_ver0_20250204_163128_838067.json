    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's a young adult, 20 years old. That age group is typically associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, so that's a medium factor. She identifies as Black, which can sometimes be a demographic risk due to systemic issues in the criminal justice system, but I'm not sure if it's high or medium here.\n\nShe has a history of drug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years and some feelings of depression recently. Drug use is definitely a high risk factor because it's linked to recidivism. The depression might also contribute as she could be more vulnerable to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted before, which is a good sign, but an arrest alone isn't enough to determine her risk. She's living alone now after growing up in a household of three with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household can sometimes lead to higher risks, so that might be medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which is neutral but could mean she lacks some support systems or educational barriers that might contribute to risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs this year, indicating she has some stability, which is positive. However, her recent feelings of depression and past drug use might override that stability.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: age, race, drug history, mental health, family background, education, employment, and criminal history. The most significant factors seem to be the drug use and possible mental health issues, so I'd rate those as high. The age is medium, and the living situation might also add some risk, maybe medium. The lack of a conviction is low because it's not a strong indicator of future behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, her likelihood of rearrest in three years is probably moderate to high. But without more detailed mental health assessments or substance abuse treatment history, I'm leaning towards medium confidence but with a higher tendency.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult age group associated with higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Demographic risk due to systemic issues in criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana use linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression may contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a single-parent household in urban area\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment is neutral\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs indicating stability but not directly related to risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
