    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested five times but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a young male, 19 years old. That age is typically associated with higher risk-taking behaviors and lower impulse control, which could contribute to criminal behavior. So I think that's a high factor here.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that racial factors can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, but it's a bit tricky because sometimes it's correlated with socioeconomic factors rather than individual behavior. Still, being part of a marginalized group might increase his risk due to systemic issues, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has five arrests but no convictions. That suggests he's been involved in criminal activities without facing the consequences, which could mean he's more likely to continue, feeling that he won't be caught or punished. So that's probably high.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how much height and weight play into risk factors, but maybe being on the lower side of average for his age might not be a significant factor. I'll go with low here since it doesn't seem directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. Living with others might mean he has more social support or supervision, which could reduce risk, but if he's in an environment that supports criminal activities, it might increase it. It's a bit of a toss-up, so maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor for criminal behavior because it limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities for income or status. That should be high.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment, especially at his age, can lead to boredom, frustration, and higher risk-taking behaviors. So that's definitely a high factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a predictor of criminal behavior, but frequent use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky activities. However, since it's only marijuana and he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are often linked to criminal behavior, but if he's not currently experiencing depression, it might not be a direct factor right now. Still, historical factors could matter, so perhaps low to medium.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can expose him to different influences and stressors that might increase criminal risk. That's probably high.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the role of religion in his life. Lack of spiritual beliefs can sometimes lead to lower adherence to societal norms and higher risk-taking behaviors. So that's another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the highest factors are age, prior arrests without convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, large family size, and lack of religion. The lower ones might be physical stats and current mental health. So confidence is pretty high that he'll have a rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age associated with higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black racial identity may be correlated with systemic issues\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Five arrests without conviction suggest continued behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"low\", \"Physical description not directly related to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might offer some supervision or support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma and not enrolled limits job opportunities\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may impair judgment\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed reduces immediate mental health risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Large family in urban area may expose to stressors\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief might reduce adherence to norms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
