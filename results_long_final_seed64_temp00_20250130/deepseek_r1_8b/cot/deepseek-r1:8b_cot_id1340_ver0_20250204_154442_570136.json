    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might influence his likelihood of being rearrested in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, he's a Hispanic male, which is a demographic factor. I know that being Hispanic can sometimes correlate with higher rates of criminal behavior, but I'm not sure if that's a high or medium risk here. He hasn't been convicted yet, so maybe his arrest record isn't as significant on its own.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 180 lbs. That doesn't immediately ring any bells in terms of risk factors. Maybe body type isn't a big factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. Living with others might mean more social support or supervision, which could lower the risk compared to someone living independently who might have more freedom to engage in criminal activities. So maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it limits job opportunities and can lead to frustration, which might increase criminal behavior. This seems like a medium to high risk factor depending on other factors.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing force, so having a job might reduce his chances of rearrest. That could be a low or medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is positive because substance abuse is a common contributor to criminal behavior. Feeling not depressed also suggests he's mentally stable, which might lower recidivism. So these are both low risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of 11. Growing up in a large family might provide more supervision or role models, which could reduce the risk compared to someone from a single-parent home or a broken family. That's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his life personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor because it provides moral support and community ties. If he lacks religious beliefs, that might increase his risk, so this could be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: Hispanic (maybe medium), no prior conviction (low), employment (low), no drugs or depression (low), big family (low), and lack of religion (medium). So the overall prediction would lean towards \"NO\" for rearrest. Confidence is around 60-70% because while some factors are protective, others might slightly increase risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Hispanic\", \"medium\", \"Demographic factor linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"No prior conviction\", \"low\", \"Arrest without conviction may not indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Job stability can reduce criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"No drug use\", \"low\", \"Substance abuse is a common contributor to crime\"),\n    (\"No depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health issues often linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Large household\", \"low\", \"Big family may provide supervision and support\"),\n    (\"No religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious beliefs can increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
