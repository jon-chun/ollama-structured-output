Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which might be relevant because some studies show demographic differences in recidivism. But I'm not sure if it's high or low risk here. Maybe medium since there could be biases in the system.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. That seems positive; higher education often reduces crime rates. So that's probably a low risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which is a direct indicator of criminal history. That should definitely be a high risk factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future rearrests.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 185 lbs. Not sure how physical build affects risk, but maybe it's low since body size isn't a major factor in recidivism studies.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might increase risks if he lacks supervision or support. So that could be medium to high.\n\nHe has two jobs this year, which is a good sign. Employment usually reduces crime risk, so that's low.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is great. Drug use is a big contributor to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, but he did live with non-biological parents as a kid. That could have long-term effects, maybe increasing his risk. So that might be medium.\n\nReligious beliefs about God influencing his life\u2014religion can be protective or increase risk depending on context. Maybe medium since it's unclear how it affects decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history is high, education and employment are low, no drugs low, living alone medium, past foster care medium, religion medium, demographics maybe medium. So overall, the highest factor is his criminal history, which is a strong indicator of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male demographic factors may influence risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions are a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical build not significantly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk without supervision\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment is protective against crime\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Past foster care and current mental state could affect risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs may influence behavior differently\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
