    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a White male, 5'9\", 140 lbs. He's single, living alone, enrolled in school, no job. That seems like he might be vulnerable because he doesn't have a stable environment or income, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a history of drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk for recidivism. He hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe his mental state isn't as much of a factor now.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents, which might have exposed him to more crime influences. That's a medium risk factor because living in an urban environment often correlates with higher crime rates.\n\nReligiously, he believes God plays a role in his life. That could be either positive or negative; sometimes religion can help with rehabilitation, but it's not directly tied to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that as low.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant factor. Prior convictions usually predict future recidivism, so that's high risk.\n\nEnrollment in school might be a positive sign, indicating he's seeking education over crime, but it's not enough on its own, so maybe medium.\n\nNo job history could mean he's more available for criminal activities, so that's another medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is high, prior convictions are high, urban background is medium, school enrollment is medium, no job is medium. So the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and prolonged drug use increases the likelihood of criminal behavior recurrence\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of convictions strongly correlates with future recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban household may expose individuals to higher crime influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Enrollment in school can indicate efforts toward positive change but does not eliminate risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No job history may leave individuals more available for criminal activities\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
