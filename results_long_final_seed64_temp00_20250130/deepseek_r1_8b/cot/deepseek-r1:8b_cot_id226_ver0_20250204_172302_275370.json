Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a White male, 6'0\" and between 175-199 lbs. That's average build, nothing too extreme. He hasn't married yet and is not living alone\u2014so maybe he's with family or friends. His education level is low since he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Unemployment is a big red flag because it can lead to financial stress and criminal behavior.\n\nHis substance use: using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is concerning. Plus, he's feeling down recently, which could mean higher risk of recidivism due to emotional instability or seeking escape through drugs again.\n\nHis background: lived with his mother in a household of four. That might have provided some stability but maybe not enough. He believes in God's influence on his life, which could be a source of support or a point of stress if he feels like he's failing divine expectations.\n\nHe has five arrests and convictions, so he's got a history of breaking the law. Without stable employment or education, it's harder to reintegrate into society, increasing the chances of further criminal activity.\n\nPutting this all together: unemployment, low education, substance use, recent emotional distress, and past criminal history are all high risk factors. Each of these contributes significantly to the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable employment increases financial stress and reduces opportunities for positive engagement\"),\n    (\"low_education\", \"high\", \"Low education level limits job prospects and increases vulnerability to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent substance use (marijuana and cocaine) raises the likelihood of continued criminal activity\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress\", \"high\", \"Current feelings of despair can increase risk of recidivism due to emotional instability\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that may continue\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four as a child provides some stability but may not be sufficient to prevent future issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
