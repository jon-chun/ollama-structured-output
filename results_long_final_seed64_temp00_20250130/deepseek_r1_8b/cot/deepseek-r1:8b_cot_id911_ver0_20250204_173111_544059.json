    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. I know that younger people might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing. So, high risk there.\n\nHe identifies as White. From what I've read, race can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, but it's a bit nuanced. Some studies show systemic biases, so maybe medium risk for racial identity.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest might indicate higher risk of future arrests, especially if there were no consequences. So, high risk here.\n\nHis height is 6'0\" and weight 185 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats directly affect recidivism, but being larger could make him more intimidating or maybe lead to more confrontations. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support of a family or significant other, which can be a risk factor. So, high risk there.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education reduces recidivism. Since he's not in college, that's a medium to high risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can stabilize someone, so having only one job might be okay, but maybe not enough. So, low to medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. No drug use is good, and mental health issues are a risk factor. Since he's not depressed now, that's positive. So, low risk here.\n\nAt 22, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a big family might provide more support or different influences. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life personally. Religiosity can be protective, but if it's just personal belief without involvement in religious activities, maybe not as strong. So, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: age is high, arrest history high, living alone high, education medium-high, employment low-mid, no drugs or depression low, family background mid, and religiosity low. The strongest factors are age, arrest history, and living alone. So overall, I think the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and lack of life experience\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: While race can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, it is nuanced and may not always directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: A prior arrest indicates potential for future criminal behavior if not addressed\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Height and weight can influence interactions and behaviors in the community\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone may increase risk due to lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Higher education typically reduces recidivism, so lower education is a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Employment can stabilize individuals, but one job might not be sufficient\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Current lack of depression reduces risk factors related to mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large family in an urban area may have mixed effects on recidivism\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in God without active involvement may not significantly impact recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
