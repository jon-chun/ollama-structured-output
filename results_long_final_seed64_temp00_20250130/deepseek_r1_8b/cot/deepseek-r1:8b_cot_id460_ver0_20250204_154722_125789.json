Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White and identifies as such. That might be relevant in terms of societal or systemic factors affecting recidivism, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 204 lbs. His weight could be a factor if it relates to health issues, which might influence his behavior. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living with someone else. Living situation can impact risk factors. If he's in a stable environment, that might reduce the risk, but if unstable, it could increase it. I need to consider this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is often linked to recidivism. Lower education levels can contribute to higher rates, so this might be a high factor.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs in the year. Employment is usually a positive indicator. More stable employment could lower the risk of recidivism, so I'll consider this as low.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Recent drug use is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, so this should be high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are linked to recidivism. If he's not currently depressed, it might lower the risk compared to someone who is, but I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with 6 siblings. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment can have both positive and negative influences. It might contribute to higher risk factors, so medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his life personally. Religiosity is often cited as a protective factor. Without strong religious beliefs, this could increase recidivism risk, making it high.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is the highest factor, followed by education and religiosity. Employment is low, living situation medium, mental health low, family background medium, and race low. Overall, the high factors are more influential, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Being White may not significantly influence recidivism independently\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: His weight could be associated with health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living with someone else might indicate a stable or unstable environment\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lower education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Not feeling depressed might lower recidivism risk compared to those who are depressed\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large urban household can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of belief in God is linked to higher recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
