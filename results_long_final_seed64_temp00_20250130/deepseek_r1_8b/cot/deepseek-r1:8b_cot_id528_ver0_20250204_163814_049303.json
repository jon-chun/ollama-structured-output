    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested five times and convicted. He's Hispanic, lives alone, hasn't married, has a GED, works part-time, uses marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, grew up in an urban area with his biological dad in a household of five, and believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the factors:\n\n1. Age: 21, which is young for recidivism.\n2. Gender: Male, who might be more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n3. Hispanic ethnicity: Could have cultural or systemic issues affecting arrest rates.\n4. Criminal history: Five arrests and convictions, indicating past issues.\n5. Employment: Part-time job, which might provide some stability but not enough.\n6. Drug use: Recent marijuana use could increase risk of further crimes.\n7. Mental health: Not depressed recently, so maybe low risk here.\n8. Family background: Grew up in a large urban household with his dad; possibly supportive or neglectful.\n9. Religion: Believes in God's influence, which might provide some structure but could also be a coping mechanism.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Criminal history is high because he's been arrested and convicted multiple times.\n- Drug use is medium-high since recent use can lead to more crimes.\n- Age is medium; younger people are typically higher risk.\n- Gender is medium-high as males often have higher recidivism rates.\n- Employment is low since having a job can reduce criminal behavior, but part-time might not be enough.\n- Family background: Urban and large household could mean more exposure to crime, so medium.\n- Religion: Could be either low or high; if it's a coping mechanism, maybe medium. If it's just belief without support, maybe low.\n- Mental health is currently good, so low.\n\nPutting this together, the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence because of the criminal history and drug use being significant factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium_high\", \"Recent marijuana use increases risk of further crimes\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium_high\", \"Males often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Part-time job provides some stability but not enough\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with a large household may expose to crime\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence could be a coping mechanism or lack thereof\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently not feeling depressed reduces immediate risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
