    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's a young adult, 22 years old. That age group is typically associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, so that's a medium factor. She identifies as Black, which can sometimes be a demographic risk due to systemic issues, but I'm not sure if it's high or medium here because her arrest record is clean.\n\nShe has a history of being arrested once, but no convictions. That might indicate she's at the early stages of delinquent behavior, so maybe that's a low factor since it's just one incident and no prior convictions.\n\nHer physical description: 5'5\" and 158 lbs. Not sure how much body weight affects criminal risk, but being petite might not be a significant factor. Maybe low here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to higher stress or isolation, which could contribute to criminal behavior. That might be medium because it's a social factor that could influence decisions.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education might limit her opportunities, increasing the risk of getting involved in crime. That seems like a medium factor as well.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but felt down recently. The drug use being clean for four years is positive, so that's low. The feeling down could be a sign of stress or emotional issues that might lead to criminal behavior, so maybe medium there.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of two. Growing up in a small family might have provided some support but could also mean she lacked supervision, which might contribute to higher risk. That's probably medium.\n\nShe believes in God and considers religion in her personal life. Religiosity can sometimes be protective against crime, so that's a low factor because it might reduce her likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the factors are: age (medium), race (low?), arrest history (low), physical stats (low), living situation (medium), education (medium), recent mood (medium), family size (medium), and religion (low). \n\nI'm a bit unsure about her race. Sometimes being part of a minority group can increase risk due to systemic issues, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's low.\n\nSo, I'll assign the factors as follows:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Race: Low\n- Arrest History: Low\n- Physical Stats: Low\n- Marital Status/Living Alone: Medium\n- Education Level: Medium\n- Drug Use: Low\n- Emotional State: Medium\n- Family Size: Medium\n- Religiosity: Low\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, I think the overall risk is medium. She has some risks like living alone and not having a college degree, but she's clean from drugs and religious, which might mitigate some of that.\n\nSo, my prediction would be \"NO\" for rearrest in three years with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age may contribute to higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"demographic factor but no prior convictions\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"only one arrest, no convictions\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"low\", \"not significantly related to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"living alone may increase stress or isolation\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"lack of further education can limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"clean record indicates lower risk\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"feeling down could contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"small household might lack supervision\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"protective factor against crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
