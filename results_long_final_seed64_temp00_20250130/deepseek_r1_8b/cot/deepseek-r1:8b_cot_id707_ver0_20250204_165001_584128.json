    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male. I know that race can be a factor in criminal justice systems, but I'm not sure if it's a direct indicator of recidivism. Maybe it's more about socioeconomic factors tied to race rather than the individual's risk.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and convicted, which suggests he has a history of criminal behavior. That's definitely a high risk factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future rearrests.\n\nHis physical description: 6'2\" and 145 lbs. Not sure how that ties in directly, but being taller might not be a significant factor here. Maybe body weight could relate to substance use, but it's not clear.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure or supervision that comes with family or marriage, which can increase risk. So that's probably medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now. Education can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism by providing structure and goals. That would lower his risk, so maybe low.\n\nHe hasn't held a job this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it may lead to financial stress or boredom, increasing the chances of criminal behavior. So that's medium.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Even if he hasn't felt depressed recently, substance use itself is a high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can influence criminal behavior, but since it's only been a month, it might not be as stable an indicator. Maybe low to medium.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five. A large family might provide more supervision or resources, which could reduce risk. So that's probably low.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective, so that's another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: prior convictions (high), drug use (high), unemployment (medium), living alone (medium), education (low), family size (low), mental health (low), and religiosity (low). \n\nSo the high factors are prior arrests and drug use. The medium ones are unemployment and living alone. The lows are education, family, mental health, and religion.\n\nI think his overall risk is moderately high because of the two high factors and some medium ones. But I'm not sure if it's enough to predict a \"YES\" or \"NO\". Maybe 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: He has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which significantly increases the risk of rearrest\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Unemployment can lead to financial stress or boredom, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone may lack supervision and structure, potentially increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Being enrolled in school provides structure and goals, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: A large household may offer more supervision and resources, lowering recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: He hasn't felt depressed recently, indicating current mental health stability\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in God's influence can provide a protective effect against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
