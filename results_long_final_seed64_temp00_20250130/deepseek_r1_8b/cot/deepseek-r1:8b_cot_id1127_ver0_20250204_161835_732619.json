    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographic: Hispanic male, 5'11\", 200-224 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but not extremely so. I don't know if weight directly correlates to recidivism, but being in that range might be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having an education is usually protective, so maybe this is a low factor. Not having college enrollment could mean he's less motivated or structured, which might increase risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so that's probably a positive factor, making it low.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent drug use is a concern, but not feeling depressed could mean he's managing stress better, which might lower the risk compared to someone who's using and depressed.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents\u2014three-person household. Urban environments can be high-crime areas, so that's a medium factor. Having both parents might provide some familial support or supervision, which could mitigate risk, but it's still a medium because of the urban setting.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religion can be a protective factor, providing moral support and structure, so that's low.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might increase risk as there's no one to monitor or intervene, but it's not extremely high since he's 20 and could still have social supports.\n\nArrest history: Four arrests and convictions. That's a strong indicator of higher risk, so that's definitely a high factor.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors with high risk are arrest history and possibly living alone. The others seem to have lower or medium impact. So overall, I think there's a moderate to high risk he'll be rearrested in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight within a range typical for higher risk demographics\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some level of education, which is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family structure may influence risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk due to lack of supervision\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
