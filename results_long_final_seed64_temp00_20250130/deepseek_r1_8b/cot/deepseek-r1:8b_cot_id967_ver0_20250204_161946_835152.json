Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates because they might lack impulse control and are still developing. So, high weight here.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race alone is a significant factor, but some studies suggest that racial disparities exist in arrest and conviction rates, so maybe medium.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest could indicate higher risk, especially if there were no consequences, which might embolden further behavior. So high weight.\n\nHeight is 5'8\" and weight 140 lbs. Not sure how physical stats affect risk, but being average doesn't stand out as a factor. Maybe low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors because there's less supervision or accountability. So medium.\n\nHas a high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education level is important; lower education might correlate with higher recidivism. Medium weight.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs this year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so more job stability could reduce risk. High weight.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Current drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk for further criminal behavior. High weight.\n\nHas not felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are linked to recidivism; if he's not currently depressed, maybe lower risk. Low weight.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior, potentially reducing risk. Medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), arrest history (high), employment (high), drug use (high). These strong factors might outweigh others like education and religiosity. So prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates due to lack of impulse control\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial disparities exist in arrest and conviction rates, suggesting higher risk for White individuals\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Prior arrest indicates potential for future behavior without consequences\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stats don't significantly impact criminal risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can correlate with higher risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lower education may increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Job stability can reduce criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed may lower risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can influence behavior, potentially reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
