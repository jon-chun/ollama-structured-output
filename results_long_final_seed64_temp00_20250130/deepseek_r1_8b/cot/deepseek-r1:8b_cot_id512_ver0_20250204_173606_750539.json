He has a high school diploma, not in college, held three jobs this year. No drug use in the past four years but feels really down during the past month. He grew up with non-biological parents in a rural area and believes God plays a role in his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each factor and assign a weight based on how it relates to recidivism.\n\n1. **Race**: Being Black is often associated with higher risk factors due to systemic issues, so this might be medium-high.\n\n2. **Age**: 20 is relatively young, increasing risk, probably high.\n\n3. **Previous Arrests/Criminal History**: He's been arrested once and convicted, which is a strong indicator, so high.\n\n4. **Employment Status**: Holding three jobs shows responsibility, which could lower risk, maybe low.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone might indicate social isolation, increasing risk, medium-high.\n\n6. **Education Level**: High school diploma is positive, reducing risk, probably low.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: No recent drug use is good, so low.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: Feeling down could mean higher risk, medium-high.\n\n9. **Family Background**: Growing up in a non-traditional household might increase risk, medium-high.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: Believing in God's influence might provide support or stability, possibly lowering risk, low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues that can increase criminal justice involvement\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future rearrest\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium_high\", \"Living alone without a partner may increase social isolation risks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels are associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium_high\", \"Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium_high\", \"Challenging family environments may increase risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide social support, reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 151 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
