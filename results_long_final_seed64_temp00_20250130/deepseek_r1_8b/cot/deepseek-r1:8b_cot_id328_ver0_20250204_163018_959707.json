    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part of her history step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and 5'4\", 115 lbs. Not sure how relevant physical build is, but maybe it ties into substance use or other behaviors. She hasn't married yet and lives alone. That could mean she lacks a support network, which might increase risk factors like social support.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Having a GED is usually positive, but not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which can be linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe's held three jobs this year. Stable employment is generally good, so that might reduce her risk factors. But she hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but she was arrested once\u2014maybe for something else like a misdemeanor or theft?\n\nHer mental state: feeling down a lot, which could be depression or anxiety. That's a significant factor because mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism. She also mentions that God has something to do with her personal life, which might indicate she's part of a religious community or has strong beliefs. Sometimes religion can provide support, but if it's used to justify criminal behavior, it could be problematic.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area with a large household. Growing up in a big family might mean exposure to more influences, both positive and negative. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so that's another point against her.\n\nArrest history: one arrest but no conviction. That suggests she might have had some contact with the criminal justice system, which could be a risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, her mental health is a big concern. The lack of social support and possible exposure to negative influences from her upbringing also raise flags. Her stable employment is positive, but her current mental state and past arrest might outweigh that. She hasn't used drugs in four years, which is good, but she's feeling down, which could lead to other issues.\n\nI'm a bit torn about the arrest\u2014since it didn't result in a conviction, maybe it wasn't a serious offense. But still, any contact with law enforcement can influence recidivism risk. Her belief system might provide some support or might be used to justify further actions if she's struggling mentally.\n\nOverall, considering her mental health and lack of social support, I think the risk is medium. She has some positive factors like employment and no recent substance use, but the negative ones are significant enough to pose a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22-year-old female who identifies herself as White\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"has never been married and is currently living alone\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"has held 3 jobs during the year\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"has not used any drugs in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
