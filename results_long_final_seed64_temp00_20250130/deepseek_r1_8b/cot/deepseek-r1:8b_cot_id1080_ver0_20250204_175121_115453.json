    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He's 6'4\", 210 lbs, never married, living alone. He has a high school diploma and is in college. He held one job last year. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. He believes God plays a role in his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each factor and assign a weight based on how it might influence rearrest risk.\n\n1. **Age**: 21 is considered young; younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing.\n2. **Race**: Being Black can be a risk factor as studies show higher arrest rates and potential bias in the system.\n3. **Arrest History**: Two arrests and a conviction suggest he's had interactions with the criminal justice system before, increasing risk.\n4. **Employment**: Holding one job is positive; stable employment reduces risk.\n5. **Education**: Being in college is protective, as education can lead to better life outcomes and lower crime rates.\n6. **Substance Use**: Using marijuana recently could increase risk, though it's less severe than other drugs.\n7. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed might lower the risk compared to those with mental health issues.\n8. **Family Structure**: Growing up in a large household in an urban area can have both positive and negative effects; urban areas often have higher crime rates.\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Believing in God could provide social support, potentially reducing risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the person has some protective elements like education and employment but also some risks like arrest history and living in an urban area. The prediction leans towards \"YES\" with medium confidence because while there are positive indicators, the arrest history is significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and lack of life experience\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Studies indicate that racial disparities can influence criminal justice outcomes, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and financial stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels are associated with lower criminal activity and better life outcomes\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"A lack of depression symptoms can sometimes mask underlying issues, but it's a less direct factor\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments and large households may contribute to higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide social support, potentially reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
