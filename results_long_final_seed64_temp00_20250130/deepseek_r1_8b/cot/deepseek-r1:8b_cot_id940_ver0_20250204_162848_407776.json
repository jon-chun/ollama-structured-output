    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part of her history step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and 5'6\", 165 lbs. Not sure how relevant height and weight are here, but maybe they can influence behavior or how she interacts with others. I'll note that as a possible factor.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone now. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support of a family or partner, which could increase her risk of getting into trouble again because she's more isolated.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level can be a protective factor; having goals and structure might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. But since she's only been arrested once, maybe this isn't the strongest point.\n\nShe's held one job this year. Employment can be stabilizing, so that's another positive sign. It gives her routine and financial stability, which might lower recidivism.\n\nShe used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor. However, not being depressed now could mean she's managing her mental state better, which might reduce some risks.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences. Having both parents around might have provided some support or supervision, but without knowing the family dynamics, it's hard to say if that was positive or not.\n\nHer religious beliefs about God influencing her life could be a protective factor. Religion often provides moral support and a sense of purpose, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted yet, so she might be at a lower risk compared to those with a history of convictions. But being arrested once shows some involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is high risk, living alone is medium, education and employment are low, family background is medium, and religious beliefs are low. The prediction leans towards \"NO\" because while there are risks, she has some protective factors like education and religion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior but may influence interactions\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone can increase risk of isolation, which may lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: High school diploma and enrollment in college provide structure and goals, reducing criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding a job provides routine and financial stability, potentially lowering recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Not feeling depressed may indicate better mental health, reducing some risks\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in an urban household with both parents may have provided support or exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Religious beliefs can provide moral support and purpose, potentially deterring criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
