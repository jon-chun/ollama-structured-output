    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He's 6'4\", weighs 190 lbs, never married, living alone. He has a high school diploma, not in college, held three jobs this year. He used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban household of five. He believes God plays a role in his personal outcomes.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each factor and assign a weight based on how it might influence rearrest risk.\n\n1. **Age**: 21 is considered young for recidivism, so maybe medium.\n2. **Gender**: Male, which typically has higher recidivism rates than females, so high.\n3. **Prior Arrests/Convictions**: Two arrests and a conviction, indicating some criminal history, so high.\n4. **Employment**: Held three jobs, which is positive, so low.\n5. **Drug Use**: Used drugs recently (past four years), which is a risk factor, medium-high.\n6. **Mental Health**: Not depressed recently, but past issues might exist; hard to assess, maybe low.\n7. **Family History**: Lived in a large urban household with his mother\u2014could be chaotic, so high.\n8. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God affects outcomes, which might influence behavior positively or negatively; unclear, so medium.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest. Confidence is around 70% because while there are several high-risk factors like prior convictions and family history, positive aspects like employment and no current depression might mitigate some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males typically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Conviction indicates criminal history\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium_high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"high\", \"Challenging family background increases risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in divine influence on outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
