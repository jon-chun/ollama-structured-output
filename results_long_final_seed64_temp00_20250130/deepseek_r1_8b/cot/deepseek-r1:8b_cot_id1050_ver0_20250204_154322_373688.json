    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic info: Hispanic, 5'7\", 185 lbs. He's never married and lives alone. Not having a high school diploma or GED might be a red flag because education is linked to lower recidivism. He's held five jobs this year, which is positive but maybe not enough if he's been using drugs.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and felt down in the past month. Drug use itself is a high risk factor. Feeling down could indicate emotional instability, which might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHis background: grew up in an urban area with both parents in a household of six. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so that's a medium risk. He believes in God's influence on his life, which might provide some support or structure, but it could also be a coping mechanism if he's struggling.\n\nArrest and conviction history: two arrests and at least one conviction. That's a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, so high risk there.\n\nLooking at all these factors together, the drug use and arrest history are significant. The lack of education is another point that could contribute to recidivism. His current employment might help, but if he's using drugs, it could be a sign of instability.\n\nI think each factor should have a weight based on how much they influence recidivism. Drug use is probably the highest because substance abuse is a strong predictor. Arrest history and education are also high. The urban background and belief in God might be medium factors.\n\nPutting it all together, I'd say there's a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of education can contribute to recidivism but may not be the most significant factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism, but job instability may increase risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing increases exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide support or coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
