    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested three times but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's Hispanic and 5'0\", 145 lbs. I don't know if height and weight are directly related to criminal behavior, but sometimes being a certain size can affect how people interact or be targeted by authorities. Not sure yet, maybe medium risk there.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that some people with families have. That could lead to higher risk because she might not have someone to help her stay on track or provide emotional support. So maybe high risk here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having a job and not being in school can be risky factors. Without structure, it's easier to get into trouble. So that's probably medium to high risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is good. But she's been feeling really down lately. Depression or emotional issues can lead to higher risk of criminal behavior as a way to cope. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both parents, part of a household of five. Urban environments are often more stressful and have higher crime rates. Plus, growing up in a big family might mean she's used to dealing with chaos or learned behaviors from her environment. So that's another high risk.\n\nHer belief in God's influence on her life could be either positive or negative. If it's giving her a sense of purpose or structure, maybe lower risk. But if it's making her feel like she's being punished or that things are out of her control, that might increase risk. I'm not sure, but it might lean towards medium.\n\nPutting it all together: three arrests without convictions suggests some involvement in the criminal justice system before. The lack of education beyond high school and no job makes me think she might struggle with constructive activities. Her current emotional state is a big red flag for potential relapse or new issues. Growing up in an urban, large household adds environmental stress. Her religious beliefs could either help or hinder her, but without more info, I'll assume it's a medium factor.\n\nSo, factors would be: age, criminal history, education, employment, substance use, mental health, family background, and possibly demographics. Weighing them, the highest risks are mental health and lack of support systems, followed by criminal history and environment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age may contribute to higher risk factors such as impulsivity and limited life experience\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrests without convictions indicate potential involvement in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and employment can lead to increased risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No job or enrollment in college may increase vulnerability to negative outcomes\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Clean record suggests lower risk from substance-related issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Current emotional distress can heighten the likelihood of problematic behaviors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing and large family size may expose her to higher stress and chaos\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence could either support or hinder her, depending on personal interpretation\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year.
