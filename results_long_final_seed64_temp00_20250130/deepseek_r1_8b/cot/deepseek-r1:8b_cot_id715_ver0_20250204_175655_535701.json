    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's 18, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might be more impulsive. That could be a high risk factor right there.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't think race alone is a significant factor in recidivism without other related issues. So maybe that's low or medium.\n\nShe has two arrests but no convictions. This makes me think she might have been arrested on misdemeanors or minor offenses, which could indicate lower severity. But it also shows she's been involved with the criminal justice system before, which might be a risk factor. I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and 190 lbs. Not sure how that plays in, but being heavier can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, so maybe medium.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean she doesn't have the support system of a family or significant other, which might increase her chances of getting into trouble again. That seems like a high factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and lead to more criminal activity as she might struggle to find meaningful employment. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in the past year, which shows some responsibility. But since she doesn't have a diploma, maybe her job stability isn't great long-term, so this could be a low factor or medium.\n\nShe has used drugs recently\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially if she's continuing to use after arrest. This should be high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While depression can lead to criminal behavior, not feeling depressed now might mean she's either managing it or not currently affected. Still, her history with drugs could indicate underlying issues, so maybe medium.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both biological parents in a rural area. Larger families can sometimes provide more support, but being from a rural area might limit access to resources and increase isolation. Not sure how big this factor is, perhaps medium.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior, but without knowing if it's positive (like helping her avoid crime) or negative (like not seeking help), it's hard to assess. Maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting it all together: age is high, arrest history medium, living alone high, education low, job stability low, drug use high, mental health current low but past issues possible, family background maybe medium, and religiosity unclear. So the main high factors are age, drug use, and living alone. Medium ones include arrests, education, job, family, and possibly mental health. Low might be race, current depression, and religiosity.\n\nSo confidence is about 70% because while there are strong high factors, some are medium or low which could mitigate the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to immature decision-making\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate criminal behavior but no convictions suggest lower severity\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone may increase risk of isolation and poor decision-making\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Lack of education can limit job opportunities and contribute to criminal activity\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held five jobs showing responsibility but lack of diploma may affect long-term stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not currently depressed but past issues could influence behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Household size and rural upbringing may limit resources and increase isolation\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence without clear positive impact on behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
