    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He's White, 6'0\", 230 lbs, living alone, not married, no high school diploma, not in college, held one job last year. He's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and feels really down every month. He grew up with both parents in a household of four and doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, I should break down each factor and assign a weight: low, medium, or high. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nAge is 19, which is young for recidivism. Younger people might have higher risk due to less experience with the justice system. So maybe medium.\n\nRace/ethnicity: White individuals sometimes have different rates of recidivism compared to others, but I'm not sure if it's a strong factor here. Maybe low.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'0\" is average, 230 lbs is on the heavier side. Obesity can be linked to higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Being single might increase risk due to lack of support, so high.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED, not in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor for recidivism, so high.\n\nEmployment: Held one job last year. Having a job can reduce risk, but only one might not be enough, so maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and feels down. Current drug use is a major factor, especially if he's using in the past month. High risk here.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with both parents in a household of four. Stable family can reduce risk; unstable might increase it. His family seems stable, so maybe low.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't believe in God. Lack of spirituality can be a risk factor, so high.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors with high weight are drug use and lack of education. Those are big contributors to recidivism. The others have medium or lower weights. So overall prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have different recidivism rates compared to others\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity can be linked to higher risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Living alone and never married can increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job might not reduce risk sufficiently\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background can reduce risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Lack of spirituality can be a significant factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
