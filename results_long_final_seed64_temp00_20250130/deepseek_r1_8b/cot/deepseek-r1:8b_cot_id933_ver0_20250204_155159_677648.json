    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might contribute to the likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, he's an 18-year-old, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions yet. So that's a point in favor of a higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that racial factors can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, but it's a bit tricky because sometimes there's systemic issues involved. However, in terms of recidivism, being White doesn't necessarily mean higher or lower risk on its own. It might not be a major factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting. Sometimes an arrest without a conviction can indicate that the charges were dropped or dismissed, which might suggest he wasn't a high threat. But it could also mean he was involved in some behavior that led to an arrest but not a conviction. I'm not sure how much weight to give this yet.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 0 inches and 185 lbs. Not sure if that's relevant, but maybe being larger could be associated with higher risk? Or maybe it's just physical description without impact on behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support system of a family, which can sometimes lead to more risky behaviors or isolation, increasing the chance of getting into trouble again.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment rates, both of which are linked to criminal behavior. So this is probably a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having a job is generally a positive indicator because it provides structure and income, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So this might lower his risk compared to someone without employment.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Not using drugs recently suggests he's making positive choices, which could reduce the chance of criminal behavior. Feeling not depressed also indicates better mental health, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support and supervision, which can buffer against delinquent behaviors. So this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it often correlates with lower recidivism rates because of moral beliefs and social support from religious communities.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors related to education (high risk), employment (lowers risk), substance use (low risk), family structure (low risk), and religiosity (low risk) seem to be the most influential. His age is a high risk factor, but it's balanced by other protective factors like employment and no recent drug use.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about his arrest history since he wasn't convicted. It might indicate that he was involved in something minor or that the system didn't find enough evidence. That could mean he's less likely to reoffend because the initial incident didn't lead to a conviction.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think his risk is medium overall. He has some high-risk factors like age and lack of education but also has protective factors like employment and religiosity that might mitigate those risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can lead to higher unemployment and increased criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment provides structure and income, reducing criminal activity\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use indicates positive choices and lower risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed suggests better mental health, which is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a supportive household can buffer against delinquent behaviors\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral support and lower recidivism rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
