    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested four times and convicted. He's Hispanic, 5'9\", 140 lbs, married, living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. He held one job last year. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. He grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. He believes God plays a role in his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors provided and think about each one's weight.\n\n1. Age: 22 is considered young for recidivism risk assessment. Younger individuals often have higher risks due to less experience with the criminal justice system and more impulsivity. So, this might be a high factor.\n\n2. Gender: Male. Males generally have higher rates of criminal behavior than females, so this could be medium or high. But since he's married, that might mitigate some risk.\n\n3. Hispanic ethnicity: There isn't a definitive link between ethnicity and recidivism, but some studies suggest certain groups are overrepresented. Maybe medium.\n\n4. Criminal history: He has been arrested four times and convicted, which is significant. High risk factor.\n\n5. Employment: Held one job last year. Stable employment can reduce criminal behavior, so this might be low or medium. Since he's only held one job, maybe medium.\n\n6. Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use can increase recidivism risk, especially if it's current. High factor.\n\n7. Depression: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of depression could mean lower risk compared to those with mental health issues. So, low or medium. Since he's not currently depressed, maybe low.\n\n8. Family structure: Grew up in a household of four with both parents. Stable family background can be protective. Medium or low. Given the size and both parents present, this might reduce risk, so perhaps low.\n\n9. Religiosity: Believes God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can be protective against criminal behavior. So, low factor.\n\n10. Marital status: Married and living with spouse. Marriage is generally a protective factor, reducing recidivism. High protection, so this could lower risk. Maybe medium or low.\n\n11. Education: Has a high school diploma but not in college. Higher education levels are associated with lower recidivism rates. So, having only a diploma might be a medium factor since it's better than no diploma but not as good as higher education.\n\n12. Past arrests: Four times arrested and convicted. This is a strong indicator of higher risk. High factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- Criminal history (4 arrests/convictions): High\n- Drug use: High\n- Age: High\n- Employment: Medium\n- Marital status: Low/Medium\n- Education: Medium\n- Family structure: Low\n- Religiosity: Low\n- Depression: Low\n- Past arrests: High\n\nI need to assign weights. The most significant factors are criminal history, drug use, age, and past arrests. These are all high. Employment is medium because having a job can mitigate risk but he only held one, which might not be as stable.\n\nMarital status is low because being married usually reduces recidivism more than just being in a relationship. Family structure is also low since growing up with both parents is protective.\n\nEducation is medium; without college, it's a slight risk factor.\n\nReligiosity and lack of depression are low factors.\n\nSo, the prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence because multiple high-weight factors point to higher recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age increases impulsivity and criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher criminal rates; marriage may mitigate\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals sometimes overrepresented in criminal data\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"four arrests and convictions indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"one job held suggests some stability but not enough to negate risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"recent marijuana use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"lack of depression reduces risk compared to those with mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"stable family background lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs can protect against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"married status significantly reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma is better than none but less than college\"),\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"high\", \"multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
