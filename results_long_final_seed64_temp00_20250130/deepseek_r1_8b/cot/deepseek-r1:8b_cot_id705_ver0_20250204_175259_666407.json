    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From what I know, younger people, especially in their early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may be more impulsive. So, I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. There's some research suggesting that racial factors can influence recidivism rates, but it's complicated. Some studies show higher rates among certain groups, but others argue that socioeconomic factors play a bigger role. Still, for the sake of this assessment, I'll consider it medium because it might not be the most significant factor on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest can indicate a history of problematic behavior, even if there's no conviction. This is often associated with higher recidivism rates, so I think this is high.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 165 lbs. While physical size can influence how crimes are committed, it's not directly related to the likelihood of rearrest. So, this factor is probably low.\n\nHe has never been married and isn't living alone. Living arrangements can affect risk factors. Living with others might provide more supervision or structure, reducing the risk, while living alone could increase it due to less oversight. Since he's not married but also not living alone, maybe medium because it's a neutral situation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is a strong predictor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. Not being in college might mean he's more likely to engage in criminal activities, so this is probably high.\n\nHe has held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having a job suggests he's functioning well socially and economically, which reduces risk. So, low here because it's a positive indicator.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is a good sign as substance abuse is a major contributor to criminal behavior. Feeling depressed could be a risk factor, but he hasn't reported it, so this is medium.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. Larger families might provide more supervision or role models, which can lower recidivism. So, low because the environment was supportive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior; believing in a higher power might deter criminal activity. This is medium as it's a positive factor but not necessarily the strongest.\n\nPutting this all together, I think he has several high-risk factors like age, prior arrest, education level, and some medium ones like race, employment, and religiosity. The absence of substance use and depression also help. So, overall, I'm leaning towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Some studies suggest racial factors can influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"Arrest history indicates potential for further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical size doesn't directly predict rearrest likelihood\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might reduce supervision, but not married either\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of higher education increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment is a stabilizing factor reducing criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"No recent substance use reduces immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"No reported depression, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger household may provide more supervision and support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God can deter criminal activity\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
