    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's Black, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues and over-policing in some communities. So that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might mean less supervision or support, but I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having an education level of high school diploma without further education could be a medium risk since it's associated with lower socioeconomic status, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment can be a protective factor, so having only one job might not be as strong as having more stable employment, but it's still positive. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is a good sign because drug use is often linked to criminal behavior. Similarly, not feeling depressed could indicate better mental health, which might lower recidivism risk. So these are both low risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or supervision, which can be protective. That's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor as it provides moral support and may deter criminal behavior. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nArrest history: two arrests without convictions. This could indicate higher risk because being arrested is often a precursor to further criminal activity, even if not convicted yet.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the factors lean towards lower risk, but some like arrest history and race might be medium. So maybe most factors are low except for those related to arrest history and race.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Black demographic associated with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone may not significantly increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without further education\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"One job may indicate some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of five providing support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrests without convictions indicate higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
