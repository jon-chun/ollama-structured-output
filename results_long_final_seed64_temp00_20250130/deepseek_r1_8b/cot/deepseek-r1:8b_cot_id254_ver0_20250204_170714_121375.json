    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrested in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's 18, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions yet. That makes me think this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that race can be a sensitive topic, but there's some research suggesting that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system. Being part of a marginalized group might increase her chances of reoffending due to systemic issues or lack of resources. So, I'd say this is also high.\n\nShe has four arrests and convictions. A history of prior arrests is a strong indicator of future rearrests. People who have been convicted before are more likely to reoffend because they've established a pattern. This seems like a high risk factor as well.\n\nHer physical description: 5'2\" and 160 lbs. I'm not sure how much body size affects recidivism, but it's worth noting. Maybe if she has access to certain opportunities or face more challenges due to her size, that could play a role. Not sure if this is high, medium, or low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide support or supervision, which can reduce the risk of reoffending. If she's not living alone, maybe she has more structure, so this could be a lower factor.\n\nShe's enrolled in school. Education is a positive indicator because it keeps her occupied and involved in constructive activities. This likely reduces her likelihood of getting into trouble again, so I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can also be a stabilizing force. Having a job shows she's responsible and has routine, which can deter criminal behavior. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is great because substance abuse is a major contributor to crime. Feeling not depressed also suggests she's mentally stable, which reduces the chances of impulsive actions. Both of these are positive signs, so they're low risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with five people. Growing up in a big household might have provided more supervision and support. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, but having a supportive family could mitigate that. This seems like a medium factor because while the environment is challenging, she had a family to support her.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God or religion. I'm not sure how this affects recidivism. Some people find religion helpful for coping with stress, which might reduce criminal behavior. Without that, maybe she's more vulnerable, but it's unclear. This could be a low or medium factor depending on other factors.\n\nPutting all these together: her age is high, race is high, prior arrests are high, living situation is medium, education and employment are low, substance use and mental state are low, family background is medium, and religion is maybe low. \n\nSo, the highest risk factors are age, race, and prior convictions. These are all significant indicators. The next ones are her family situation and possibly her lack of religious beliefs. The lower factors are her current activities like school and work.\n\nI think she has a high overall risk of being rearrested in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Racial disparities exist, with marginalized groups often facing systemic issues\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"History of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with others may provide support, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school indicates constructive activity and lower reoffending likelihood\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding a job shows responsibility and routine, which can deter criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use suggests reduced involvement in criminal activities\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed indicates mental stability and lower impulsive behavior risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Supportive family background may mitigate urban challenges\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief might affect coping mechanisms, increasing vulnerability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
