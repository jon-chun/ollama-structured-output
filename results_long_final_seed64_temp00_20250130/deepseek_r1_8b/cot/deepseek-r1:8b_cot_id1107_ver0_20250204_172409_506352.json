    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographic: Hispanic male, age 19. Being male is a known risk factor, so that's probably medium. His age might be a mitigating factor since he's young, but the fact that he's been arrested suggests higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. A history of arrests can indicate higher risk, especially if there's a pattern. So maybe medium or high here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be protective, so that might lower the risk. I'll consider this as low.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high.\n\nHe has held 5 jobs in the year. Employment is usually positive, but since he's been arrested, it might not offset other factors. Maybe medium.\n\nHe used drugs (cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of recidivism unless combined with other factors like criminal history or lack of support. So maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can be both a risk factor for crime and a protective one if untreated. Without more info, I'll say low.\n\nHe grew up in a large household (7 people) in an urban area. Big family size might provide more supervision or resources, so that's low.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his life. Religiosity can be protective, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: male, two arrests, education issues, some employment, drug use, and a belief system. The key factors are lack of education (high), criminal history (medium), drug use (medium), and religiosity (medium). So overall, the risk is medium to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Age and gender contribute to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests without conviction indicate potential for further issues\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education strongly correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job stability can mitigate but doesn't negate other risks\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use increases risk, especially without support systems\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates lower immediate risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with large family may offer some protection\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence can be protective but may not negate other risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
