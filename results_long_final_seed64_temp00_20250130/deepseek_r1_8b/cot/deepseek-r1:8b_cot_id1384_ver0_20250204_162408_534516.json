    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrested in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That makes me think she might have had charges dropped or maybe she was involved in some sort of diversion program instead of going to prison. But just because she hasn't been convicted doesn't mean she's low risk. People can get rearrested even without a conviction, especially if they're still involved with the criminal justice system.\n\nShe identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I'm not sure how that plays into her risk factors, but sometimes there are studies showing certain demographic groups might have different recidivism rates. Maybe being part of a marginalized group could increase her risk, either due to systemic issues or personal experiences with the justice system.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 140 lbs. Not sure about the weight in terms of risk, but body size can sometimes be a factor in how authorities interact with her, though I'm not certain if that's directly relevant here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Having a stable family life might reduce her risk compared to someone without such support. Marriages can provide structure and support, which could deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to economic struggles, which are linked to higher crime rates. Without education, she might find it harder to stay out of trouble.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having employment could be a positive factor, showing she has some structure in her life. But since she only had one job, maybe her work situation isn't very stable, which could increase her risk if she loses that job or faces financial difficulties.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor because it's often linked to criminal behavior. If she continues using drugs, especially if she's using more heavily, she might be more likely to get rearrested for new offenses or parole violations.\n\nIn the past month, she felt down and nothing could cheer her up. That sounds like she's experiencing some level of depression or emotional distress. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior because people dealing with mental health problems might have lower self-control or higher stress levels that lead them to commit crimes.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area when she was young. Growing up in a large family, especially in a rural setting, might expose her to different influences compared to someone from a smaller family or an urban environment. I'm not sure if that's a high risk factor, but it could influence her social circle and access to resources.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally. That's a personal belief, which might be part of her coping mechanism or worldview. It's unclear how this would directly impact her risk, but spiritual beliefs can sometimes play a role in behavior, either positively or negatively.\n\nPutting all these together: she's got some risk factors like drug use and lack of education, which are strong indicators. Her mental health issues could also contribute. However, having a stable marriage might mitigate some of those risks. The fact that she hasn't been convicted yet suggests she might be more likely to reoffend if she continues on the same path.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because several major factors point towards higher recidivism: drug use, lack of education, and possible mental health issues. But I'm not entirely sure about her spiritual beliefs and how that might influence her behavior. Maybe that's a medium factor instead of high. So, I think the prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence around 70-80% because while there are strong indicators, it's not certain without more data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice, indicating potential involvement in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"Ethnic Identity\", \"medium\", \"Belonging to a marginalized group may contribute to systemic issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding one job shows some stability, reducing immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and increases economic struggles linked to crime\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps can lead to higher stress levels, increasing criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a large family might influence social circle but isn't a direct high risk factor\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs may offer coping mechanisms but aren't directly linked to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
