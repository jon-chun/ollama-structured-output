Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's Asian/Pacific Islander, which might have some cultural implications, but without specific data on that group's recidivism rates, I can't assign a weight based on that alone. So maybe low or medium.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 145 lbs. Not particularly tall or overweight, so physical size isn't a big factor here. Maybe low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure of a family to support him, which could increase risk. So maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not having further education might be a risk factor as it can limit job opportunities and lead to more criminal activities. Maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can contribute to criminal behavior, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor; recent drug use increases recidivism. So high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but if he's not currently experiencing it, maybe lower. But I'm not sure how much weight to give this. Maybe medium.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the supernatural. Religiosity can influence behavior, so lack of belief might increase risk. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: unemployment (high), drug use (high), urban background (high). Those are three strong factors. The others are less impactful but still contribute. So overall, I think he's at high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"5'9\\\" and 145 lbs\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married, lives alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"high\", \"Lived with biological dad in urban area\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Does not believe in God\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
