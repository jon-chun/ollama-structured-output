    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each piece of information given and see how it might influence that risk.\n\nFirst off, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. I know that age can be a factor; younger people might have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals who have more life experience and possibly better coping mechanisms. So maybe his age is a medium or high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted, which suggests he's had some run-ins with the law before. A history of criminal behavior often correlates with future rearrests, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis physical description: 6'3\" and 190 lbs. I'm not sure how much height and weight play into criminal behavior directly, but being larger might make him more intimidating or give him more confidence in committing crimes. Maybe medium risk there.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more opportunities for bad decisions since there's no one around to check or monitor his activities. That could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education level can influence life outcomes; higher education might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior as people with better skills are less likely to get involved in crime. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year, which indicates he's employed. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which can deter criminal activities. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is positive because substance abuse is a significant contributor to crime. Feeling not depressed might mean he's dealing with stress in a healthy way or has better mental health, which could lower his risk. So both of these are low risk factors.\n\nHe was raised by adults other than biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a non-traditional household and in an urban environment can sometimes lead to higher exposure to criminal influences. That's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHis lack of religious belief might mean he doesn't have a support system or moral framework that could deter him from crime. Without such beliefs, he might be more prone to engage in criminal activities, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), prior arrests and convictions (high), employment (low), education (low), no drug use (low), mental health (low), upbringing (medium), physical size (medium), religion (high). \n\nSo the highest risks are from his age, criminal history, lack of religious beliefs, and upbringing. The lower risks come from being employed, educated, not using drugs, and good mental health.\n\nI think he has a higher likelihood of being rearrested, so the prediction would be \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience and coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"A history of arrests and convictions increases the likelihood of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"physical_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger physical size may contribute to confidence or intimidation in criminal activities\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase opportunities for bad decisions without external oversight\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Higher education level typically reduces criminal behavior through improved life skills\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment provides structure and stability, reducing criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers the risk associated with substance-related crimes\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Good mental health can help in dealing with stress and avoiding criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Non-traditional upbringing in an urban area may expose individuals to more criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious beliefs may reduce deterrence from crime and moral framework\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
