    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From what I know, younger people might have higher recidivism rates because they're less experienced with the criminal justice system and might make poorer decisions. So that's probably a medium risk there.\n\nShe's mixed race, but I don't think race itself is a direct indicator of recidivism. It can be influenced by systemic factors, but without more info on how her race affects her specific situation, I'll consider it low.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted yet, which is a good sign. People who haven't been convicted are less likely to reoffend, so that's medium risk.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly related, so those can be low.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Having a stable family life usually reduces the chances of criminal behavior, so that's another medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities and increases stress, leading to criminal behavior. That's probably a high risk here.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to frustration and higher likelihood of crimes out of desperation, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but felt down recently. Recent emotional distress can increase the risk of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, so that's medium.\n\nShe grew up in a household of four. Larger families might provide more support, which could lower recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHer lack of religious beliefs is another factor. Beliefs can influence behavior; without religion, she might have fewer moral constraints, increasing risk to high.\n\nPutting it all together: age (medium), education level (high), unemployment (high), recent emotional issues (medium), and lack of religion (high). The highest risks are education, employment, and belief systems, which often have strong correlations. So overall, the prediction is likely \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to inexperience and decision-making\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself isn't a direct indicator; systemic factors can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"conviction history\", \"medium\", \"No prior conviction suggests lower immediate risk\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Stable family life reduces criminal behavior likelihood\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases stress and joblessness, leading to crime\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to frustration and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Recent emotional distress may increase risk of coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Larger families often provide more support, reducing recidivism\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Beliefs influence moral constraints; without religion, higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
