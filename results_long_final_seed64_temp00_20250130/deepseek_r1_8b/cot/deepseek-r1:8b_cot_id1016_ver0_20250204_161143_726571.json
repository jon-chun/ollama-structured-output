    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested three times but not convicted. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, her demographic: she's Black, which is a factor that often correlates with higher recidivism rates. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that's a bit of a neutralizing factor. She's 5'2\" and 140 lbs\u2014doesn't seem particularly threatening physically, so I don't think that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that could help her stay out of trouble, which could be a medium risk factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED is a big red flag because education is a strong predictor for criminal behavior. That should definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of criminal activity, so having only one job might not be enough to lower her risk much, but it's still better than nothing. Maybe that's a low or medium factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is positive because substance abuse is a major driver of crime. Her mental state seems stable too, which could reduce her risk compared to others who might be struggling with mental health issues. So those are both low risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of six. Growing up in a big family can sometimes lead to higher exposure to criminal influences or chaotic environments, so that's another medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective against crime, but since it's just her belief and not active involvement, maybe it's less impactful. Still, it might contribute a low risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: race is a high factor, education is high, household size is medium, employment is low or medium, substance use is low, mental health is low, religiosity is low, and living alone is medium. \n\nSo, the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" she will be rearrested within three years. Confidence is about 70% because while several factors are high risk, others might mitigate it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_size_young\", \"medium\", \"Large households may expose to more chaotic environments\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment can reduce criminal activity, though limited job history\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use reduces immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently stable mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer some protection against crime\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support systems\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
