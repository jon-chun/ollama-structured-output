    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to a high or low risk of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's Hispanic and 19 years old. I know that age can be a factor; younger people might have different motivations for reoffending compared to older individuals. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe her situation is still early on, which could mean lower risk or higher risk depending on other factors.\n\nShe has only been arrested once but not convicted. That suggests she's at the initial stages of the justice system. Maybe she's more likely to continue down a path that doesn't lead to convictions yet, which could be either good or bad for recidivism. I'm not sure if being arrested without a conviction is a strong indicator here.\n\nHer physical description includes height and weight, but I don't see how that directly ties into criminal behavior. Maybe it's more about her environment or access to resources, but I can't think of a direct link right now.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the same level of supervision or support as someone in a family setting. That could increase risk if she's engaging in high-risk activities without oversight. On the other hand, it might also mean she has more autonomy, which could either help her get back on track or make it easier to engage in criminal behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher rates of criminal activity because it limits job opportunities and increases stress levels. Without these tools, she might struggle to find stable employment, leading her to turn to other means for income or status, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. That's a positive sign because having a job can provide structure and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. But it's only one job, so maybe she's not very stable yet, which could increase her risk if she loses that job or faces other challenges.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use is a significant factor; those who abuse substances are more likely to reoffend because drugs can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. The fact that she's feeling down could indicate stress or emotional instability, which might also contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe was raised in a household with four adults but not her biological parents, living in an urban area. Growing up without one or both parents can lead to neglect or inconsistent discipline, which might increase the risk of delinquency and subsequent criminal behavior. Urban environments often have more crime and exposure to negative influences, so that's another factor pushing towards higher risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which is a personal belief. I'm not sure how religious beliefs directly affect recidivism, but some studies suggest that faith can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. Without that, she might lack a support system or moral framework that could prevent her from reoffending.\n\nPutting all this together, several factors seem to point towards higher risk: being in the justice system (though not convicted yet), lack of education, drug use, and adverse upbringing in an urban environment. However, having held a job is a positive indicator. The prediction isn't certain, but considering these factors, it's more likely than not that she will be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age may increase risk of criminal behavior due to immaturity and lack of life experience\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction suggests potential for further engagement with the justice system\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing stress and likelihood of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job is a positive indicator of stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and past usage are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Adverse upbringing in urban area increases exposure to negative influences and neglect\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief may reduce protective factors against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
