    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From what I know, younger individuals, especially those under 25, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might be more impulsive and less likely to consider the long-term consequences of their actions. So, this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as Black. I remember that racial disparities in the criminal justice system are well-documented. Being Black often correlates with higher arrest and conviction rates, which can contribute to recidivism. This is probably a medium to high factor depending on other variables, but given his history, it might lean towards high.\n\nHe has been arrested six times without any convictions. A history of multiple arrests suggests he's involved in criminal activity, even if not convicted yet. This could indicate higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 140 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stature directly affects recidivism, but being taller might correlate with lower impulsivity or more planning in crimes. Maybe this is a low factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to more opportunities for criminal behavior without supervision. This could be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits employment options and increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for survival. This is definitely a high factor.\n\nHe has held no jobs this year. Unemployment, especially at a young age, can lead to higher risk as individuals might turn to crime for income. Another high factor here.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of recidivism, but active use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. His current state is feeling down, which might be linked to substance use. This could be medium to high.\n\nHe feels so down that nothing cheers him up, alluding to possible mental health issues like depression. Mental health problems are known to contribute to criminal behavior as individuals may act out due to emotional distress. This is a significant factor, likely high.\n\nHe lived in a household of four as a child. Growing up in a larger family might have exposed him to more stressors or different environments that could influence his behavior. This could be medium.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes act as a protective factor, but if it's tied to a belief that divine intervention will prevent consequences, it might not protect him and could even increase risk by giving him a sense of invulnerability. This is tricky; maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors with high weight are: age, prior arrests, education level, unemployment, drug use, mental health, and possibly household size. The factors with lower weights might be physical stature and religious beliefs. So, overall, I'm leaning towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial disparities in criminal justice are well-documented\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate involvement in criminal activity\"),\n    (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"Taller stature may correlate with lower impulsivity\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase opportunities for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits employment and increases criminal engagement\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment at a young age can lead to crime for survival\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Active drug use impairs judgment and increases criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues like depression can lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger households may expose to stressors influencing behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs might not protect against consequences\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
