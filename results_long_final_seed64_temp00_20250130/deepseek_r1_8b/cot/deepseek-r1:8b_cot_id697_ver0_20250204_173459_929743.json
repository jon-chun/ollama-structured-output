    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested six times and convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a White male, 5'10\", 170 lbs. He's never married and lives alone. That might indicate some social isolation or lack of support systems, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Not having higher education can be a red flag for future criminal behavior because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year, which suggests he's not establishing positive routines or income, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for means of support.\n\nHis substance use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use could indicate a higher risk of continued criminal behavior, especially if he's using more frequently or has a history of drug-related offenses.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is interesting because sometimes substance abuse can be a coping mechanism for underlying issues like depression. If he's not currently experiencing depression, it might mean other factors are at play.\n\nHe was raised in a household with two adults who weren't his biological parents, living in a rural area. Growing up without a stable parental figure can contribute to higher risk factors, including criminal behavior and poor decision-making.\n\nHis lack of religious beliefs or connection to any faith could mean he lacks a support system or moral framework that might otherwise deter him from criminal activities.\n\nHe's been arrested six times with convictions, which shows a pattern of criminal behavior. Each prior arrest increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor seems to contribute positively to the risk of rearrest within three years. The combination of substance abuse, lack of education and employment, social isolation, and a history of arrests points towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"high\", \"White male, 5'10\\\", 170 lbs, never married, living alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate, not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with non-biological parents in a rural area\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Does not believe in God or religion\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrested six times, convicted\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
