    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might contribute to the likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which is a demographic factor. I know that being male generally increases the risk compared to females, so that's probably a medium or high factor. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's not as high as someone with a history of convictions.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 287 lbs. That's on the heavier side for his height, which might contribute to health issues later, possibly leading to substance abuse or other problems that could increase criminal activity. So I think this is a medium factor because being overweight can be a risk but not necessarily the highest.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support system that married individuals often have, which could lead to higher risk behaviors. This seems like a medium factor as well.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for future criminal involvement because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is a known predictor of crime. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Having a job is generally good, but only one job might indicate he's not very stable or might have difficulty holding down steady employment, which could contribute to criminal behavior. So this is probably medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs lowers the risk compared to those who do, so that's a low factor. Feeling not depressed also reduces the likelihood of certain behaviors associated with substance abuse or other issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household of four. Growing up in a big family, especially in an urban environment, can have mixed effects. It might provide some support but could also expose him to more stressors like crime and poverty. This is a bit tricky, but I think it's medium because while it's not ideal, he didn't live in a severely dysfunctional household.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the supernatural. Lack of religious belief isn't directly tied to criminal behavior, so this might be low. It could mean he lacks a support system through religion, but that's speculative.\n\nPutting all these together: being male (medium), not having a job (medium), lack of education (high), living situation (medium), and no recent drug use (low). The highest factor is his education level, which is a strong indicator. So I think the overall risk is medium to high, leaning towards high because education is such a big influence.\n\nSo, my prediction would be \"YES\" he'll be rearrested in three years, with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Male demographic increases risk\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"medium\", \"Overweight may contribute to health issues and behavior risks\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk due to lack of support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job may indicate instability, increasing crime risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed reduces certain behavioral risks\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with a family of four provides some support but may expose to stressors\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
