    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might contribute to the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nFirst off, he's a young male, 19, which is typically a higher risk age group for recidivism because they're still developing and might make poor decisions. Plus, he identifies as Black, which statistically has higher rates of incarceration and recidivism compared to other groups. That seems like a significant factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. While an arrest doesn't mean a criminal history, it does show some involvement with the justice system. Maybe this indicates he's at risk of continuing behaviors that lead to arrests, even if he hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nHis physical description is 5'5\" and 135 lbs. I'm not sure how much height and weight play into recidivism, but being on the lower side might make him more vulnerable or perhaps have other associated risks, though it's a bit unclear.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 could mean he lacks supervision or support systems, which might increase his chances of engaging in criminal activities. It also suggests he might not have strong social ties that could help him stay out of trouble.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment, both of which are risk factors for recidivism. Without education or skills, he might turn to criminal activities as a means of survival.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment, especially at his age, can be a significant stressor. Without income, he might resort to illegal activities to get money, which could lead to further arrests and rearrests.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and doesn't feel depressed now. Not using drugs recently is positive because it reduces one factor contributing to criminal behavior. However, his mental health isn't mentioned beyond not feeling depressed in the past month. If he's dealing with other issues like anxiety or anger management, that could still pose a risk.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with a household of five, living with his biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Growing up in a large household might mean he lacked individual attention or had inconsistent discipline, which can contribute to delinquent behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life personally. Religiosity is known to play a role in desistance from crime. Without religious beliefs, he might lack a support system that helps him avoid criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, several factors stand out as high risks: age, race, lack of education, unemployment, and growing up in an urban environment. These are all strong indicators that his likelihood of rearrest is high. The arrest history, though not a conviction, also adds to the risk. His current situation without support systems or positive influences makes me lean towards a higher prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age (19) increases risk of recidivism due to immaturity and decision-making\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Statistical correlation between race and higher rates of incarceration, recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction indicates potential for continued criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing risk of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment at young age can lead to survival through crime\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack supervision and support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing with large household may contribute to delinquent behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God may reduce protective factors against crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
