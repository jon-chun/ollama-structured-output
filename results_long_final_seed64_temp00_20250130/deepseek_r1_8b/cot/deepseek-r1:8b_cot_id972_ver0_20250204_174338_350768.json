    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might influence her likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's 18, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might be more impulsive. That could be a high risk factor right there.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race alone is a significant factor here, but it can sometimes influence judicial outcomes, so maybe that's a medium risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This makes me think she might have had her charges dropped or dismissed, which could indicate she's less likely to reoffend compared to someone with a conviction. So this might be a low factor.\n\nHer physical description: 5'10\" and between 150-174 lbs. I don't know if weight is a strong indicator of risk, but maybe being in that range isn't particularly high or low. Maybe medium?\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more stress or easier access to opportunities for crime, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag because it limits job prospects and can increase criminal activity. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Having steady employment can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of crime, so that's a low factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is good because it reduces immediate risks, but without knowing her past, it's hard to say if she had issues before. Still, not feeling depressed could be a low factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household of four. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so that's a medium risk.\n\nHer lack of religious belief might mean she doesn't get the moral support or structure religion can provide. That could increase risk, so maybe high.\n\nPutting it all together: Young age is high, race is medium, no prior conviction low, employment low, education high, substance use low, mental health low, family background medium, and lack of belief high.\n\nSo each factor's weight would be:\n- Age: High\n- Race: Medium\n- Prior Conviction: Low\n- Employment: Low\n- Education: High\n- Substance Use: Low\n- Mental Health: Low\n- Family: Medium\n- Belief: High\n\nNow, considering all these together, her risk is moderately high. I'm about 70% confident she'll be rearrested in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to immature decision-making\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Race can influence judicial outcomes, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"low\", \"No prior conviction may indicate lower likelihood of reoffending\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment provides structure reducing criminal activity\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job prospects and increases criminal activity risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces immediate risks\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently not feeling depressed may indicate lower risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing in a large household exposes to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"belief\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious belief may reduce moral support and structure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
