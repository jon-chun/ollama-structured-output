    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, which is a demographic factor. I know that being male generally increases the likelihood of criminal behavior, but I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors. Maybe it's medium risk because it's a common trait among offenders.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a high school diploma can sometimes indicate a lower likelihood of recidivism, but since he's not in college, that might be a negative factor. So I think this is a low or maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior arrest, which is a significant indicator. People with prior convictions are more likely to reoffend, so this should be high risk.\n\nHis weight is between 225 and 249 lbs, which is on the heavier side. I'm not sure how much body weight affects recidivism, but being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher risks due to health issues or socioeconomic factors linked to crime. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives with someone else. Living arrangements can influence behavior. Being single might increase risk because of different social influences, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially for violent crimes or more serious offenses. Since he's been using recently, this should be high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, but if he's not currently depressed, that might lower the risk compared to someone who is. So maybe low risk here.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. Having both parents around might provide some level of supervision or stability, so this could be a protective factor, making it low risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor against recidivism because it provides moral frameworks and social support. So this is probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction (high), drug use (high), urban upbringing (low), religion (low). The other factors like age, employment, and living situation are medium or low. So the overall prediction leans towards YES with high confidence because of the strong high-risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male demographic increases risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED and not enrolled in college may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Overweight may correlate with higher risk due to health or socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Single and living with someone else may increase risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may reduce risk compared to those who are depressed\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents may provide stability\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
