    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old male being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From what I know, younger people, especially in their early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may have fewer ties that keep them from committing crimes again. So, I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as Black. I remember reading that racial factors can influence recidivism rates, but it's complicated. Some studies show higher rates among certain groups, so maybe this is medium or high. But I'm not entirely sure if it's directly tied to the individual's behavior or more systemic issues. I'll tentatively put this as medium.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This might indicate that he's been in the criminal justice system before, which could mean he's more likely to reoffend. So, this is probably a high risk factor because being arrested multiple times can lead to a cycle of further arrests.\n\nHis height and weight are within the average range for someone his age. I don't think physical factors like height or weight significantly affect recidivism, so these might be low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean he doesn't have the support system that might prevent him from reoffending. Without a stable environment, it's easier to engage in criminal activities again. So, this is likely medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having an education can sometimes deter people from criminal behavior, but not having further education might increase the risk. I think this could be medium or maybe low because he already has some education which might help him avoid recidivism.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor against crime. People with steady work are less likely to reoffend, so this should be a high risk factor because it shows he's responsible and has a routine that could prevent criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs and not being depressed are both positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are major contributors to recidivism, so this is low risk for both factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a large family might provide more support or possibly less structured environments, but I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism. Maybe it's medium because having siblings or a big family can sometimes lead to different influences.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor against crime. People who have strong religious beliefs are less likely to reoffend, so this is low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: age (high), race (medium), prior arrests (high), employment (high), no substance use or depression (low for both), family background (medium), and religiosity (low). \n\nSo, the factors with high weight are age, prior arrests, and employment. Medium are race, family size, and maybe education. Low are substance use, depression, and religiosity.\n\nAdding these up: 3 highs, 3 mediums, and 2 lows. Highs have more impact, so I think the overall risk is medium to high. But since each high factor contributes significantly, it might lean towards high confidence in prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
