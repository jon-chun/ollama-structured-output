    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old male being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From what I know, younger people, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may have fewer ties to the community. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I remember reading that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, with Black individuals often facing harsher sentences and having higher rates of rearrest. This could be due to systemic issues like biased policing or over-policing in minority communities. So this is another high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. While an arrest doesn't mean a conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. Previous arrests can sometimes predict future behavior, especially if there's a pattern or if there are underlying issues that led to the arrest. I think this is medium risk because it's just one arrest without a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'9\" and 185 lbs. Not sure how physical stats directly correlate with recidivism, but being heavier might be associated with higher risk due to factors like substance abuse or health issues contributing to criminal behavior. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more opportunities for bad decisions without the checks and balances of a family structure. But it's not always a direct indicator, so maybe low to medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important; those without further education often have higher rates of unemployment and may struggle, leading to criminal behavior. So this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of recidivism because it provides structure and financial stability. More job stability might mean lower risk, so maybe low here.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a predictor of future behavior, but frequent use could indicate higher risk, especially if there's a history of substance abuse leading to criminal activity. So medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, so not feeling depressed might lower the risk. Maybe low here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a large family could provide more support or possibly more chaotic environments. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think it might be a medium risk factor because larger families can sometimes have higher rates of neglect or exposure to crime.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior; believing in a higher power might provide moral guidance and reduce criminal behavior. So this could lower the risk, making it low.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), race (high), arrest history (medium), employment (low), education (medium), substance use (medium), mental health (low), family background (medium), religious beliefs (low).\n\nSo each factor's weight is assigned based on how strongly they correlate with recidivism. Age and race are the strongest, so high. Arrest history is next, then education, employment, substance use, family size, mental health, and religion.\n\nCalculating confidence: High factors contribute more. Let's say 20% for each of age and race, 15% for arrest history, 10% each for education, employment, substance use, family background, and mental health, and 5% for religion. Adding them up: 20+20+15+10+10+10+10+5=105. But since it's a prediction, maybe cap it at 100. So confidence is around 85%.\n\nFinal prediction: YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend due to less experience and fewer community ties\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Racial disparities exist, with Black individuals facing higher rates of rearrest\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrest indicates involvement but no conviction\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lower education increases unemployment and criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can indicate higher risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may lower risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Large family might expose to chaotic environments\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
