    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could be seen as a red flag, especially if there's a history of behavior that led to the arrest. But since he wasn't convicted, it's not certain yet.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 0 inches and 170 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything specific in terms of risk factors.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 might be a bit unusual, but many people do that for various reasons. It could indicate he's more independent or perhaps dealing with family issues, which might relate to higher risk factors like homelessness or financial instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower risk factors because it suggests he's motivated to improve his situation through formal education. However, if there were prior issues that led to arrest, this could be a positive sign of reform.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can indicate stability or responsibility, which might reduce some risks associated with unemployment or financial strain.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use is a significant factor. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which could mean he's managing his substance use effectively or that it's not currently impacting his mental health negatively.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various effects. It might provide some social support, but it could also be chaotic or stressful depending on the family dynamics. However, without knowing if there were issues within that household, like domestic violence or substance abuse, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This is an interesting point. If someone lacks a strong belief system or social support from religious communities, they might be more vulnerable to engaging in risky behaviors or facing challenges without the support that religion can provide.\n\nPutting this all together: He's been arrested once, which is a concern, but not convicted. He has some positive indicators like education and employment. His drug use is recent, but he hasn't reported depression recently. His family background is urban but with a large household, which could be either supportive or challenging depending on other factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a moderate risk rather than high. The arrest without conviction isn't enough to definitively say \"high,\" especially since there's no history of convictions or more severe offenses. The drug use is a concern, but the lack of depression and positive indicators like education and employment might mitigate that risk somewhat.\n\nSo, I think the prediction should be NO for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
