    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor that might be relevant, but on its own, it's not conclusive. However, considering other factors could influence the overall assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior suggests higher risk. Ten arrests indicate a pattern, which is concerning.\n\nHis physical description: 5'10\" and 160 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything specific, so I can probably set this aside unless other factors tie into it, but it doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living in a household of three as a young adult might mean he has some family support or structure, which could be a protective factor. Not having been married might indicate he hasn't formed stable relationships yet, which could be a risk if it relates to other behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for criminal behavior because it limits opportunities and can lead to unemployment, both of which are associated with higher crime rates.\n\nHe has held 1 job during the year. Having employment could be a protective factor as it provides structure and income. However, if he's only had one job, maybe it's not enough to indicate stability.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong risk factor. Regular use can lead to criminal behavior, financial issues, and other problems that may escalate into more severe crimes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior, not feeling depressed recently doesn't necessarily negate past issues or the impact of long-term substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 3. A larger family might provide some level of support and supervision, which could be protective. However, if the household had issues like neglect or abuse, that would be different, but it's not specified here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. This could indicate a sense of control or purpose, which might influence his decisions in ways that could be either positive or negative, depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are major red flags. The drug use is also highly concerning. Lack of education and only one job suggest potential instability. While some factors like family support and not being depressed recently might offer some protection, they're outweighed by the significant criminal history and substance abuse.\n\nSo, considering these points, it's likely that this person poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
