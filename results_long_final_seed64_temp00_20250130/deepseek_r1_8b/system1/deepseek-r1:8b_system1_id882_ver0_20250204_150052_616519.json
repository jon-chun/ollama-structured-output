    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes be a sign of higher risk, especially if there's a history, but since this is the first arrest and no conviction, it's a bit unclear yet.\n\nHis physical description: 6 feet 9 inches and 185 lbs. That doesn't immediately relate to risk factors, so I'll note that as neutral.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a red flag in some contexts, but it could also indicate independence or self-sufficiency. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, indicating he's at least educated up to that level. Not being in college might suggest he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk factor depending on the context, but again, it's neutral here.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so this is positive and might reduce risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Past drug use is a concern, especially if there's a history of substance abuse leading to criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which could indicate that his mental state isn't currently problematic.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally positive and might reduce risk factors associated with instability.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This could be seen as a lack of spiritual support or belief system, which might increase risk if he doesn't have a support network or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: He's had some concerning factors like past drug use and an arrest record, but no convictions yet. The lack of a strong support system (no marriage, living alone) could be a risk factor. His education and employment are positive, which might mitigate some risks. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently is also a plus.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because of the arrest and drug use history, but without more severe factors like prior convictions or significant criminal history, it's not certain. However, given the other somewhat neutral or positive factors, I might still consider this as a higher risk scenario.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
