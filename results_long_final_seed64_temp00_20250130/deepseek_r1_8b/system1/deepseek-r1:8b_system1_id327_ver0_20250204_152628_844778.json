    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but since it's just an arrest without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 140 lbs. Physical build doesn't directly correlate with risk factors, so I don't think this is relevant here.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is not living alone. She's either living with family or in some other shared arrangement. Living situation can sometimes be a factor, but without more info on her environment, it's hard to say.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes be a risk factor, especially if she's involved in criminal activities, but again, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs in the year. Employment is usually seen as a positive indicator, suggesting she's responsible and has structure in her life. That might lower her risk compared to someone without employment.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent or frequent. Her current mental state, feeling down, could indicate potential for higher risk behaviors, including criminal activity.\n\nShe grew up in a large household (10 people) in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, and large households might mean she was exposed to more stressors or different influences growing up. This could contribute to higher risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God has something to do with her personal life. Religion can sometimes be a protective factor, but it's not clear how this plays into her potential for criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some red flags like drug use and possible mental distress, which are significant. However, she hasn't been convicted yet, has employment, and there's no history of serious crimes. The lack of a conviction is a mitigating factor. Her religious beliefs might offer some protection or structure. So while her situation isn't low risk, it doesn't reach high risk without more concerning factors like prior convictions or severe mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
