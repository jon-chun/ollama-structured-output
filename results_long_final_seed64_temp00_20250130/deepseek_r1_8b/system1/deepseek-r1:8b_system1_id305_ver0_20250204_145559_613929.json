    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for an 18-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's straightforward demographic info. Age can sometimes be a factor, but since he's 18, maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions don't always indicate high risk, especially if there are no prior convictions. It could mean he's more prone to getting caught but not necessarily higher risk for reoffending.\n\nHis physical description is 5'8\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not particularly notable in terms of risk factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a red flag because it can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education is usually seen as a positive factor, indicating he's engaged in constructive activities which can reduce risk.\n\nHe has held 1 job during the year. Employment is another positive sign, showing responsibility and structure.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that his drug use isn't currently contributing to other issues like mental health problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household can be protective against delinquent behavior. Urban areas themselves aren't inherently high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, though its impact can vary widely depending on the individual and context.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got some red flags like drug use, but he's enrolled in school, employed, hasn't been convicted despite arrests, and shows some positive indicators. The lack of depression might mean his drug use isn't exacerbating other issues. His stable upbringing could also be a protective factor. So while there are risks, they don't seem to reach the level that would indicate high risk without more concerning factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
