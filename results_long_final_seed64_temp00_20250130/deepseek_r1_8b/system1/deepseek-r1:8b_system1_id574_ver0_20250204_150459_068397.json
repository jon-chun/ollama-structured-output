    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age is on the younger side, which might be a factor in assessing risk, but it's not clear how that affects criminal behavior directly.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily indicate high risk because many people are arrested and not charged or convicted. So this alone isn't a strong indicator.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'5\" and 135 lbs. While her weight can sometimes be a factor in assessments, it's not directly related to criminal behavior unless there's specific context about health risks or other factors influenced by weight.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might indicate some level of independence but doesn't inherently pose a high risk. It could also mean she has fewer support systems, which might be a factor, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower criminal activity, as education is a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests she's pursuing further education, which could reduce her risk compared to those without formal education.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might indicate economic stress or instability, which can contribute to criminal behavior. However, being 21 and in college might mean she's still transitioning, so this isn't conclusive.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Regular drug use can lead to criminal activity, including possession or distribution charges. The fact that she hasn't been convicted yet doesn't negate the risk posed by current substance use.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is another important factor. While feeling depressed recently might not be a direct indicator of high risk, long-term mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. However, since she's not reporting depression now, it's hard to assess its impact on her current risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment and with a single parent might expose her to higher levels of stress or crime, which could increase her risk. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and single-parent households can sometimes lead to economic hardship, which is linked to criminal behavior.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it may influence pro-social behaviors or decision-making. However, if her religious beliefs are tied to justification of certain actions or avoidance of authorities, it might pose a risk. But without more context, it's unclear.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a history of drug use, which is a strong indicator. She's young and in college, which might offer some protection. She hasn't been convicted yet, so her criminal history is minimal. Her living situation could be stressful due to urban environment and single-parent background, which might increase risk. However, without more information on how these factors interact, it's challenging to determine if the overall risk is high.\n\nConsidering all this, I think there's a moderate risk based on drug use and potentially unstable living conditions. But since she hasn't been convicted and has some protective factors like education, maybe the risk isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
