    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could be seen as a red flag, especially if there's a history of similar behavior or if the arrest was for a serious offense. But since he hasn't been convicted, it might not directly indicate high risk unless more context is considered.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 204 lbs. Physical build can sometimes be a factor in assessments, but without additional info on how this relates to past behavior or potential for violence, it's hard to assess its impact here.\n\nHe has never been married and is not living alone. Living with others might indicate social support or supervision, which could influence risk factors like stability or access to resources. However, this alone doesn't point towards high risk unless paired with other factors like criminal history or substance abuse.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive as it indicates some education level, but not being in college might suggest he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk factor if it relates to job stability or future opportunities that might mitigate other risks.\n\nHe has held 4 jobs during the year. Employment can indicate stability and responsibility, which are protective factors. More job positions might show initiative or financial stability, reducing some risks associated with unemployment or lack of structure.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor. The fact that he's been using within the last four years suggests potential for ongoing substance abuse issues, which can contribute to criminal behavior, poor decision-making, and higher risk of reoffending or engaging in other high-risk activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is crucial; if there's no current depression, it might indicate he's functioning well mentally at the moment. However, this doesn't account for longer-term mental health issues or past history that could still influence risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6 in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various impacts. It might provide more support or it could lead to higher stressors depending on the family dynamics and how he was raised.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This is a personal belief that might indicate a lack of spiritual or religious guidance, which some studies suggest can be protective against criminal behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to assess its impact on risk.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrest, uses drugs recently, and hasn't been convicted yet. The drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if there's a pattern of substance abuse. His employment suggests some stability, which could mitigate some risks. His mental health seems stable currently, but past or ongoing issues aren't mentioned.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of recent drug use and an arrest history are significant. The lack of a conviction might mean he hasn't been found guilty yet, but the fact that he was arrested suggests potential for further issues. The other factors like employment and mental health don't negate the impact of substance abuse and prior legal issues.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems like there is a high risk indicated by these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
