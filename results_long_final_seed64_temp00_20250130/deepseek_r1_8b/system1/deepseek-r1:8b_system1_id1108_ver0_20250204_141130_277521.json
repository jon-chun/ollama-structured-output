    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male and Black could relate to over-policing or systemic issues, which might increase risk.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. A history of arrests and convictions suggests he's had interactions with the criminal justice system before, which could indicate higher risk for future involvement.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 235 lbs. While not directly related to risk factors, being heavier might have health implications that could indirectly affect behavior or decisions, but it's not a primary factor here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't uncommon, but it might indicate he lacks strong social supports, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, as it limits employment opportunities and can lead to socioeconomic struggles.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, but if he's only had two jobs, maybe they're low-paying or unstable, which might not provide enough support.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive; lack of recent drug use and mental health issues could reduce some risks associated with substance abuse or emotional instability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 10 in an urban area. Growing up in a large, possibly chaotic family in an urban environment can increase exposure to crime and violence, which are risk factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective or sometimes associated with certain behaviors, but it's not clear here how it affects risk.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, lacks education, possibly unstable living situation, and grew up in a high-crime environment. These factors are concerning. However, he's been clean for four years and isn't currently depressed, which might mitigate some risks. But his past arrests and lack of education are strong indicators.\n\nI think the confidence is around 70% because while there are several red flags, some mitigating factors exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
