    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or less experience with the criminal justice system.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted, which suggests he's had interactions with law enforcement before. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHis physical description includes being 5'9\" and 140 lbs. While not directly related to risk factors, it might be useful for identification purposes but doesn't contribute much here.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, which might reduce the likelihood of further criminal activity, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having completed high school is generally positive, as education can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. Not being in college could increase risk if he lacks structured activities or goals.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can provide stability and reduce criminal involvement, so having only one job might not be as strong as multiple jobs, but it's still a positive sign.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that his mental state isn't currently contributing to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment can be protective, but being in an urban area might expose him to more risk factors like higher crime rates and social influences.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor as it provides moral guidance, though its impact can vary widely depending on the individual and their beliefs' strength.\n\nPutting this all together: he's got an arrest history, which is concerning. He's used drugs recently, another high-risk factor. However, he has a stable family life with a spouse, employment, and hasn't been depressed lately. These factors might mitigate some of the risks associated with his criminal history and drug use.\n\nI'm leaning towards a 'NO' because while there are clear risk factors like arrests and drug use, there are also protective factors like marriage, employment, and not being currently depressed. Without more severe or recent issues, it's hard to classify this as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
