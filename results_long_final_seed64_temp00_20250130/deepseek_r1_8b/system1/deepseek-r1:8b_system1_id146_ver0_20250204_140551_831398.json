    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor but doesn't inherently pose a high risk on its own. However, combined with other factors, it might contribute.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. A history of arrests and convictions can be indicative of higher risk, especially if there are repeat offenses or more severe charges. Since she's been arrested twice and convicted once, that's a concerning sign.\n\nHer physical description is 5 feet 7 inches and 135 lbs. Not particularly notable on its own, but sometimes physical factors can relate to health risks or other behaviors.\n\nShe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a risk factor if it relates to social support or access to resources, but again, it's context-dependent.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education could be a risk factor, possibly indicating limited opportunities or socioeconomic challenges.\n\nShe has held 5 jobs in the year. That shows some stability, which might mitigate some risks, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed in the past month might indicate she's managing her mental health or substance use effectively for now.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 3. A large family household can sometimes be protective or provide more support, but it's not directly related to risk factors unless there are issues within the family.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. That could relate to her personal beliefs and possibly her coping mechanisms or social connections.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a history of arrest and conviction, which is a strong indicator. Her drug use in the past four years adds to the risk, especially if it's ongoing. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest she's not currently experiencing related issues. The other factors like employment and living situation are mixed\u2014some positive (employment), some neutral.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are high-risk indicators like criminal history and drug use, the lack of current depression and some positive aspects might temper the risk a bit. However, her criminal history is significant enough that it could still be considered a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
