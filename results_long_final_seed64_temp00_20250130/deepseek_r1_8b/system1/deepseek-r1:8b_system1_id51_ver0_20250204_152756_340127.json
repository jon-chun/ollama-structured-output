Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. That's a red flag because arrests can indicate higher risk of future criminal behavior, especially if there's no prior conviction history.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 145 lbs. Not sure how physical stats play in, but maybe it's more about her mental state or environment.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone at 19 could mean she lacks support systems, which might increase risk factors like isolation or poor decision-making.\n\nHas a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. No job during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor linked to criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but was feeling down a lot recently. Depression could lead to higher risk of criminal activity as she might act out due to emotional distress.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household and urban environment might expose her to more stressors or different influences.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be linked to coping mechanisms or moral frameworks that might influence behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: arrest history, lack of support systems, unemployment, possible depression, and a stressful upbringing in an urban area. These factors collectively suggest higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
