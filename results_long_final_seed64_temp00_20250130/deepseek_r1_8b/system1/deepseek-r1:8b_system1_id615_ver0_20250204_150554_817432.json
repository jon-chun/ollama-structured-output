    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or less experience in managing risks.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction, which suggests some history of criminal behavior. The fact that he's been arrested but not necessarily convicted again could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 0 inches and 165 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes, but maybe being taller or heavier can sometimes be associated with different risk levels, though it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure of a family to support him, which could increase risks if he's engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is better than nothing, but not having further education can be a risk factor as it limits opportunities and might contribute to higher criminal tendencies.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, so only one job might indicate instability or difficulty holding down work, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Both marijuana and cocaine are illicit substances that can lead to criminal behavior, addiction, and other negative outcomes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important; if he's not currently experiencing depression, it might reduce some risks associated with emotional instability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household can be protective, but urban areas themselves have higher crime rates, which could contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation might reduce some protective factors that religion can provide, potentially increasing risks.\n\nPutting this all together: he's got a history of arrests and convictions, uses drugs, lives alone, isn't employed stable, hasn't completed higher education, and lacks a strong support system from religion. These factors point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
