    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So he's had some interaction with the legal system, which could be a red flag for potential recidivism or further issues. But again, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHis physical description is 5'8\" and 140 lbs. Not particularly notable in terms of risk factors, so I can probably set that aside.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone at 19 might indicate some independence, but it could also mean he lacks strong social supports, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college might suggest he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk if he's not developing new skills or\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u65b9\u5411\u3002\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. That's a good sign; employment can indicate responsibility and stability, which are protective factors.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest he's currently not experiencing the negative emotions that often lead to criminal behavior or other issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective. Rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics, but overall, this seems positive.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it often correlates with lower crime rates and better decision-making.\n\nPutting all these together: he's had some legal issues, used drugs in the past, hasn't been convicted yet, which might indicate he's at risk of further issues. However, factors like stable family background, current employment, and no recent depression could mitigate that risk.\n\nI'm a bit torn because while there are clear red flags (arrests, drug use), there are also protective factors (religiosity, employment, stable upbringing). Without more information on the nature of his arrest or his attitude towards it, it's hard to say definitively. But statistically, having been arrested and using drugs might lean towards a higher risk.\n\nI think I'll go with a moderate confidence that this indicates high risk because of the presence of both positive and negative factors, but leaning more towards the negative given the legal and drug use history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
