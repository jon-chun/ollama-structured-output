    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 21-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, which might be relevant in some contexts but not directly indicative of criminal risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested five times with convictions, which suggests a history of illegal activity. That's a strong indicator.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and between 175-199 lbs, which is average build, so that doesn't add much to the assessment. He hasn't married and is not living alone, possibly indicating he's still dependent on others or in a family setting, which could influence his behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which points to lower educational attainment, often linked with higher criminality. No jobs held during the year suggests he might be unemployed or underemployed, increasing risk factors like boredom or financial stress.\n\nDrug use is another key point: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator of violence but can contribute to criminal behavior. The recent downturn could indicate emotional instability, which might be a red flag for higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four as a young child. Growing up in a larger family might have provided some support, but it's unclear if that environment was stable or if there were other issues. His belief that God plays a role in his personal life could indicate a sense of control or purpose, which might influence his decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together: arrest history, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and emotional distress are significant factors. These elements often correlate with higher risk of recidivism or further criminal activity. The combination suggests a high likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
