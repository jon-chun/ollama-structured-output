    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction. While this isn't a long criminal history, it does show some involvement with the justice system, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis physical description: 6'2\" and 275 lbs. Not sure how much that contributes to risk assessment beyond maybe health issues or potential for violence, but not directly related unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, which might lower the risk compared to someone without stable relationships.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not having further education could be a risk factor if it affects employment or socioeconomic status, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Stable employment can indicate lower risk as it suggests he's contributing to society through work.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Recent use (within the past four years) could indicate ongoing substance issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important; not feeling depressed might suggest he's functioning well mentally at the moment, but this is a snapshot and doesn't account for longer-term mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment can have various effects, including exposure to different influences, which might be either positive or negative depending on the family dynamics.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support and community ties that might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got some criminal history, uses drugs, is employed, has a stable marriage, and some positive social factors like education and religion. The drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if it's recent. His criminal history isn't extensive, but combined with substance abuse, it could point towards higher recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards YES because the drug use is a significant factor here. It often correlates with other criminal behaviors and can increase the likelihood of further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
