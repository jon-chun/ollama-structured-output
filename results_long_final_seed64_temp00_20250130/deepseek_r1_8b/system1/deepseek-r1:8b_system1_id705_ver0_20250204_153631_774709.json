    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male could also be a consideration, though it's not always a direct indicator of higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily predict future criminal behavior, especially if there were mitigating circumstances or if the arrest was for a minor offense.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 165 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything related to risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe's never married and is not living alone. Living with others might provide some social support, which could be protective against criminal behavior. However, it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having completed high school can sometimes be a positive indicator, suggesting he has some education, though not pursuing further education might indicate other factors like financial instability or lack of motivation.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, providing structure and income, which might reduce risk. However, only having one job doesn't provide much information about the nature of that employment or its impact on his life.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent drug use is a positive sign, as substance abuse is often linked to higher criminal risks. Not feeling depressed recently also suggests he's not dealing with some risk factors associated with mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or influence his environment positively, which could be protective.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a belief system that might influence his behavior, possibly towards more prosocial activities if religion is a stabilizing factor for him.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors don't strongly suggest high risk. The lack of recent drug use and not feeling depressed are protective. His employment and education are positive signs. While he's been arrested, no conviction and only one arrest point to low criminal history. His religious beliefs might offer a stabilizing influence. Therefore, I would lean towards \"NO\" for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
