    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or lack of experience in managing risks.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of criminal history, which usually points towards higher risk. Each arrest could relate to different offenses, but the fact that he's been convicted suggests he's had formal legal issues before.\n\nHis physical description is 5'11\" and 160 lbs. Not sure how much height and weight contribute, but they might not be significant factors here unless combined with other traits.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and isn't living alone. Living with others could mean more supervision or support systems in place, which might reduce risk compared to living independently without such structures.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future behavior; having only a diploma might limit career opportunities, potentially increasing risk if he's not engaged in productive activities.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having only one job might indicate some stability but could also mean he's just starting or hasn't found consistent work yet.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of recent substance abuse is positive, as it reduces immediate risk factors. Depression could be a concern if he were experiencing it, but since he hasn't felt depressed, that's less concerning.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two. Family background can influence behavior. Growing up in a two-person household might provide some support, but without knowing the nature of the family dynamics, it's hard to assess impact on risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his personal outcomes. Atheism or lack of religious belief isn't inherently risky, so that factor alone probably doesn't contribute much.\n\nPutting this all together: criminal history is a significant red flag. His age might make him more prone to higher-risk behaviors. Employment indicates some structure but only one job. Education level and current situation don't provide as much info on risk beyond the criminal history.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the arrests and convictions, which are strong predictors. The other factors don't negate that significant aspect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
