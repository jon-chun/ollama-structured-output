    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old male. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is Hispanic and 22 years old. Age can be a factor, as younger individuals might have higher risk associated with criminal behavior due to impulsivity or lack of experience in managing stressors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest record, even without a conviction, can indicate potential for further issues, especially if there's a pattern of non-conviction but continued problematic behavior.\n\nHis height is 6'1\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. Physical build doesn't directly correlate with risk, so I'll note this but not assign significance.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he lacks the structure that a family or marriage could provide, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; lacking further education can be a risk factor as it may limit job opportunities and coping mechanisms.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. Employment indicates stability, but only two jobs might not be sufficient to support himself, which could be a stressor leading to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent or frequent. The feeling of being down (depressed) can also increase risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment might expose him to more stressors or different social influences that could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God's involvement in his life. Lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently risky but can sometimes be associated with lower adherence to societal norms, though this is speculative.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrest, current drug use, and feelings of depression. These factors are concerning for higher risk. His education and employment might offer some stability, but the presence of recent drug use and mood issues could outweigh these positives. The urban upbringing adds context that might increase exposure to negative influences.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk assessment based on these points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
