    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have less criminal history but could still pose risks based on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions don't necessarily predict future behavior, but repeated arrests can sometimes indicate higher risk behavior.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 202 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless it's related to health or substance abuse, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is not living alone. Living situation could influence decisions; living with others might provide more structure or supervision, but without knowing the dynamics, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level can be protective, as higher education often correlates with lower criminal activity. However, being enrolled doesn't necessarily mean he's engaging in positive behaviors now.\n\nHe has held four jobs in the year. Employment can indicate stability, which might reduce risk factors like boredom or financial stress that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is a concern, especially if it's recent, but not feeling depressed might suggest he's managing his mental health well now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adoptive parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household and urban environment could have influenced his upbringing, possibly affecting his behavior. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be protective or influence behavior positively, but it's not clear how strong that belief is in this context.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has some arrests, uses drugs, and comes from an urban background. However, he's employed, enrolled in college, hasn't been convicted, and isn't currently depressed. These factors might mitigate some risks. While his drug use is a concern, the lack of current depression and educational achievements could lower the overall risk compared to someone with similar but worse indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
