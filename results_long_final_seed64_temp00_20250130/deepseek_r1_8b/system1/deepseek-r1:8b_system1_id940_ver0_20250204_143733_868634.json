    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily mean high risk, especially if she's young and this is her first encounter with the legal system.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'6\" and 165 lbs. That's not particularly concerning on its own.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 could be a red flag in some contexts, but it might also indicate independence or self-sufficiency rather than higher risk behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower risk factors, as education often reduces the likelihood of certain behaviors.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, suggesting she has structure in her life which might reduce risk.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Cocaine use is concerning and could indicate higher risk behavior. However, she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest that her mental health isn't currently impaired, which could lower the risk compared to someone who's using drugs and also experiencing depression.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally positive, though urban areas can have higher crime rates, but this alone doesn't necessarily mean high risk for her.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. This could indicate a belief system that might influence her behavior or decisions, potentially in a way that's seen as risky by others, but it's hard to assess without more context.\n\nPutting all these together: she has a history of drug use, which is a significant risk factor. However, she hasn't been convicted, doesn't show signs of depression currently, and has positive indicators like education and employment. These factors might mitigate the risk associated with her drug use. Additionally, her stable upbringing and current lack of depression could suggest that she's managing her drug use in a way that isn't exacerbating other high-risk behaviors.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while there is a history of drug use, the absence of other high-risk factors might mean that the overall risk isn't necessarily high. Therefore, I would lean towards \"NO\" for this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
