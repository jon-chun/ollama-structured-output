    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. That's a demographic factor but doesn't inherently pose a high risk on its own. However, combined with other factors, it might contribute.\n\nShe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior suggests higher likelihood of recidivism. Five arrests mean she's had multiple chances to change her behavior, but if she's been convicted, that shows she's had formal legal consequences.\n\nHer physical description is 5'6\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not particularly indicative of risk, unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or criminal history.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could be a risk factor if it leads to poor decision-making or isolation, which might contribute to further issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having higher education can increase risk factors related to employment and financial stability, potentially leading to criminal behavior as an outlet.\n\nShe hasn't held a job during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor linked to higher risks of delinquency or further criminal activity.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if she's been using for multiple years. It often correlates with other high-risk behaviors like theft or violence.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can be a factor in criminal behavior, the fact that she hasn't reported feeling depressed recently might mean she's functioning better currently, which could reduce some risks but not eliminate them entirely.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adoptive parents in a rural area with a household of five. Growing up in a large family, especially in a rural setting, can have both protective and risk factors depending on family dynamics. If the family was supportive, it might lower risk, but without that info, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe doesn't believe God affects her personally. Lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently risky, but for some people, spirituality is a key factor in decision-making and behavior, so this could be a protective factor or neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history is the most significant factor here. Five arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk. The drug use also adds to that risk. Unemployment and lack of education can exacerbate issues. While some factors might be protective (like not feeling depressed), the combination of criminal history, substance abuse, and lack of support structures points towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
