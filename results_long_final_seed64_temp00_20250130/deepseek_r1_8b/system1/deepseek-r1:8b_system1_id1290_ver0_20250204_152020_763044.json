    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 158 lbs. Not sure how that plays into risk factors directly, but maybe in terms of physical health or stress levels.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if there are issues with self-care or support systems, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not having college enrollment might indicate lower educational attainment, which could be a risk factor for things like employment stability or economic issues.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs in the year. That shows some job stability, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and feels down sometimes. The drug use is positive, but feeling down could indicate mental health issues. However, she's only been feeling down \"some of the time during the past month,\" which isn't a full-blown issue.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 2. A small family might provide some support, but it's not clear if that's a risk factor here.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That could be a coping mechanism or part of her belief system, which might influence her behavior or decisions.\n\nPutting this all together: She has no criminal history beyond an arrest, shows job stability, doesn't use drugs, and has some support from her family. The only concerning factor is her feelings of being down, but it's not severe. Without more information on why she was arrested or the nature of that arrest, it's hard to assess risk. Her belief in God might help her cope, which could mitigate risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" because there aren't enough high-risk factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
