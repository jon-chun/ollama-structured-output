    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or less experience in managing risks.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions suggests she's had interactions with the criminal justice system before, which could indicate higher risk for future offenses.\n\nHer physical description is 5'4\" and 120 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes, but it's a factor to note.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or accountability, possibly increasing risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it may limit job opportunities and coping skills.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the year. Employment is generally seen as a positive factor, indicating she's capable of holding down work, which might reduce risk.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Recent drug use can be a significant risk factor for further criminal activity, especially if there's a history.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of current depression might mean she's functioning well mentally at the moment, which could reduce some risks.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or possibly less stability if there were issues.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be associated with lower risk due to moral beliefs, but it's not always consistent.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a criminal history, uses drugs, lacks education, and has some positive indicators like employment. Her mental health seems stable now, which is a plus. However, the combination of past arrests, drug use, and lack of education are concerning. The fact that she's held jobs might indicate she can manage responsibilities, but without further details on why she was arrested or convicted, it's hard to assess the nature of those offenses.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there is a moderate risk, but not necessarily high. However, given her history and current behavior, it leans towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
