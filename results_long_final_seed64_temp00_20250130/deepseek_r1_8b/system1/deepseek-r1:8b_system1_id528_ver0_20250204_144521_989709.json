    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or less experience with the criminal justice system.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted, which suggests he's had multiple interactions with law enforcement. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of higher risk.\n\nHis physical description includes being 5'5\" and between 150-174 lbs. While height and weight aren't direct predictors, they can be associated with other factors like socioeconomic status or access to resources.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support of a family or significant others, which could increase risk as there are fewer checks on behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is better than no diploma, but not having further education can be a risk factor, possibly indicating limited opportunities or lower socioeconomic status.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and stability, so having only one job might not be as concerning as having none, but it's still a point to consider regarding financial stability.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if there's a history of arrests related to substance abuse.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can influence risk; however, not feeling depressed recently doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't have a history of mental health issues or other factors contributing to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in an urban area. Growing up in a large household and urban environment might expose him to higher stressors or different social influences that could contribute to delinquent behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior; believing in a higher power might provide moral guidance, but it's unclear how this specifically impacts risk without more context.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple arrests and convictions, drug use, living alone, limited education and employment, and possibly exposure to urban stressors. These elements collectively suggest a higher likelihood of continued criminal activity or reoffending behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
