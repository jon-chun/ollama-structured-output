    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall assessment.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age is on the younger side, which might be a consideration in some contexts, but alone it's not necessarily indicative of higher risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction doesn't tell me much about her likelihood of reoffending. It could have been for a minor offense or something that was dismissed.\n\nHer physical description is 5 feet 7 inches and between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical build alone contributes significantly to risk assessment in criminal justice contexts unless there's specific behavior associated with body type, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone might be a factor if it relates to social support or access to resources, but without more context, it's hard to say how this affects risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is a positive indicator as education can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Not being in college doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there are other factors indicating higher risk.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs in the year, which suggests she's employed, providing some stability. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates because it offers structure and financial stability.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor, especially if there's a history of substance abuse leading to criminal behavior. However, not feeling depressed recently might indicate she's managing her mental health effectively, which could mitigate some risks.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective against delinquency and criminal behavior. The fact that she comes from a large household (5 people) in a rural setting might provide additional social support or community ties, which can be protective factors.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might contribute to higher risk if she's not part of a religious community that could offer guidance or support.\n\nPutting all this together: She has some risk factors like past drug use and being arrested, but there are also protective factors such as education, employment, living alone (which can sometimes be a risk factor, but without more info on her circumstances, it's hard to assess), and a stable family background. The lack of recent depression might indicate she's managing stress effectively.\n\nI'm leaning towards this person not being a high-risk individual because the protective factors seem significant. However, the arrest history is a bit concerning, especially if that was for something more serious than a minor offense. Without knowing the specifics of her arrest, it's hard to weigh that factor accurately.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think she doesn't meet the criteria for high risk based on the given information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
