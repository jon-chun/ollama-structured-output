    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old female who identifies as Hispanic. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but since it's just an arrest without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and 110 lbs. Physical build doesn't directly correlate with risk factors, so I can probably set that aside.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a red flag in terms of social support, but it's not inherently criminal or risky unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive, showing she's educated, but not being in college could indicate lower educational attainment, which might be a risk factor for things like unemployment or economic stress.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs in the year. That shows some work history and stability, which can buffer against criminal behavior.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is concerning. The fact that she used them in the past month makes it more current, increasing the likelihood of continued substance abuse, which can lead to criminal activity or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe feels down a lot, unable to be cheered up. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which are risk factors for criminal behavior as people with untreated mental health problems might turn to drugs or crime to cope.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a household and an urban environment can expose her to different stressors and influences that might increase the risk of delinquency or criminal activity.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be protective, but if it's not actively involved in her life, it might not provide the same level of protection.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a history of drug use, which is a significant risk factor. Her mental state seems troubled, which can exacerbate that risk. She's had some involvement with law enforcement, though no conviction. The combination of these factors suggests she may be at higher risk for further criminal activity or other high-risk behaviors.\n\nI should also consider her work history as a positive factor, but the drug use and mental health issues are more concerning. Without a conviction, it's hard to say definitively, but the presence of multiple high-risk indicators points towards a \"YES\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
