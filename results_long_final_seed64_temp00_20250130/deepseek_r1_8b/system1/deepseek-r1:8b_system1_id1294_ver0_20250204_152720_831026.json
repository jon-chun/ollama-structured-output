    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that can sometimes be associated with higher risk in certain contexts, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not a strong indicator of future risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 185 lbs. That doesn't seem to contribute much to risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a factor, but again, it's not directly related to criminal behavior without more information.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is often a positive indicator, suggesting he has some education, which can reduce risk factors associated with lower educational attainment.\n\nHe has held 4 jobs during the year. Employment is generally seen as a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use could be a risk factor, but the lack of current depression might mitigate that risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or supervision, which can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can sometimes influence behavior, potentially reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some factors that could be considered risks (like past drug use), the majority of the factors lean towards lower risk or neutral. The arrest without a conviction doesn't indicate a strong criminal history. His current situation shows he's working, has a stable living arrangement, and isn't currently dealing with depression. The religious belief might also contribute to a more structured life.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I don't see enough high-risk indicators to justify a \"YES\" prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
