    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for an 18-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is Hispanic and 18 years old. Age can be a factor, as younger individuals might have higher risk associated with criminal behavior due to immaturity or lack of life experience.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted, which suggests he's had multiple interactions with the justice system. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of higher risk for recidivism.\n\nHis physical description includes being 5'5\" and 145 lbs. While not directly related to criminal behavior, it might be useful for assessing potential vulnerabilities or health risks associated with drug use.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors as there's less oversight or accountability.\n\nHe is enrolled in school currently. Education can be a protective factor, but if he's using drugs, it might impact his academic performance and behavior.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity due to financial stress or lack of structure.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor as it indicates current involvement in high-risk behaviors that can lead to criminal actions.\n\nSome months ago, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests possible mental health issues or emotional instability, which can contribute to higher risk of criminal behavior.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area when young. Growing up in a large family in an urban environment might expose him to different stressors or influences that could increase his risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and considers religion unrelated to his personal life. Lack of religious beliefs can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors as there's less perceived accountability or guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple arrests, current drug use, emotional distress, and lack of support structures like employment and education point towards a high risk. The confidence is quite high because each factor contributes to a pattern of behavior that is concerning for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
