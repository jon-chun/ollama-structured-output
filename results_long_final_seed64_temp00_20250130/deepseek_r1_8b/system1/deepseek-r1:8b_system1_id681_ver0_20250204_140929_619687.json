    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall assessment.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male could also be a demographic point, though I'm not sure if that's a significant indicator on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a direct criminal history, which is definitely a red flag. Having a prior conviction suggests he's had interactions with the justice system before, increasing the likelihood of future issues.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and between 225-249 lbs. While obesity can be a risk factor in health terms, I'm not sure how it ties into criminal risk specifically unless there are other factors like substance abuse or prior offenses linked to health-related crimes.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. Living with others might indicate social support or supervision, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a protective factor or a risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is better than no diploma, but not having further education could be a risk factor as it might limit employment opportunities and contribute to economic stress, which can be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having only one job might not be concerning on its own unless there are issues with that job or previous employers.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor. Both marijuana and cocaine are illicit substances, and their use can lead to criminal charges, addiction, and other social issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression isn't directly linked to criminality, it's a mental health factor that could influence behavior. However, the time frame is only one month, so it's hard to assess long-term mental health status.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household might have provided some protective factors, but urban areas can also be high-crime environments, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support or social connections that deter criminal behavior. However, it's not clear how strong this influence is.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history, recent drug use, and living in an urban area are strong indicators of higher risk. The lack of education and employment might add to economic stress, which can be a contributing factor. His age and past stable upbringing could mitigate some risks, but the presence of criminal history and substance abuse is quite concerning.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because these factors together suggest potential for further criminal activity or involvement with the justice system.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
