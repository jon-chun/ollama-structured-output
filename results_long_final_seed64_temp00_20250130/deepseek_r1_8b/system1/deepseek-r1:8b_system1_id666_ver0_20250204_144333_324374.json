    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction, which suggests some criminal history. However, I don't know the nature of these charges\u2014whether they're minor offenses or more serious crimes. If the convictions are for violent crimes or felonies, that would increase risk more than if it's traffic violations.\n\nHe is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Not sure how physical build factors into risk assessment, but maybe in terms of potential for violence? I'm not certain about this one.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some social isolation, which could be a risk factor, especially if there's a history of substance abuse or other issues that often lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe is enrolled in school currently. School enrollment can be a positive indicator, suggesting he's engaged in constructive activities. But it's also possible that he's using school as a cover for other issues.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a red flag because it might indicate economic stress or lack of support systems, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors like substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is concerning. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed in the past month might suggest he's managing his mood, but drug use itself is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household could be protective, but if there were issues within the family or environment that contributed to his current situation, it might not fully offset other risk factors.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support and social connections, but it's also possible that this belief could influence his behavior in ways that aren't clear here.\n\nPutting it all together: He has criminal history, uses drugs, is unemployed, lives alone, hasn't been married, and is enrolled in school. The drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if he's using more than just marijuana. His criminal history suggests he might have some issues with the law, which could escalate if there are more severe charges or if substance abuse leads to more problematic behavior.\n\nHis current enrollment in school might indicate an attempt at positive change, but without knowing the nature of his previous convictions or whether he's using drugs currently, it's hard to say. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently is a bit confusing\u2014maybe he's managing stress through other means, like substance use.\n\nThe urban upbringing and family background could provide some support or have contributed to his current situation. Without more info on the nature of his arrests and whether they're related to drug use or other issues, it's tricky.\n\nOverall, considering the criminal history, drug use, unemployment, living alone, and potential social isolation, I think these factors do indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
