    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being young and male can sometimes be a factor in criminal behavior, but it's not conclusive on its own. However, considering he has a history of arrests and convictions, that adds to the risk.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant number. Repeated arrests often correlate with higher risk of future criminal activity because it shows a pattern of behavior. The fact that he's been convicted means he's had formal charges proven against him, which is a strong indicator.\n\nHis physical description: 6 feet 11 inches and 165 lbs. Not sure how much height and weight contribute to risk factors, but they might influence things like strength or mobility in committing crimes, though it's not directly indicative of criminality itself.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a red flag because it might mean he lacks supervision or structure, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. However, this alone isn't enough to determine high risk without other factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having higher education can be a risk factor as it limits opportunities and may contribute to unemployment, which is linked to criminal behavior. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of crime due to lack of productive activities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. This is concerning because joblessness can lead to frustration and higher engagement in criminal activities. Without a steady income, someone might turn to illegal means for money or status.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially in the context of being arrested before, suggests possible substance abuse issues. Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of committing crimes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, the fact that he's not currently experiencing it might mean his mental state isn't a current factor. However, past depressions or histories could be relevant, but this info isn't provided.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various influences. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and larger families might not provide the necessary support or supervision, which could contribute to delinquency.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of fatalism or lack of personal control, which might affect his decision-making processes. It's unclear how this would directly impact criminal behavior but could be a contributing factor if it leads to poor choices.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests and convictions, unemployment, substance abuse, living alone, not being enrolled in college, and growing up in an urban environment with possible neglect or unsupportive family dynamics. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of recidivism or future criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
