    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall assessment.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being a young adult and part of a minority group can sometimes be a risk factor because of higher rates of certain behaviors in these demographics. However, it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction, which suggests some history of illegal activity. The fact that he's been convicted means there's a formal record of lawbreaking, which is a strong indicator of higher risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'8\" and between 200-224 lbs. While being heavier can sometimes be associated with health risks or other factors, it's not directly related to criminal behavior unless combined with other indicators like substance abuse or prior convictions.\n\nHe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean he lacks supervision or support, which might increase risk-taking behaviors. However, this alone isn't enough.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a significant factor as it's linked to higher unemployment rates and difficulty securing stable employment, both of which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the year. While job stability is positive, having held multiple jobs might indicate efforts at self-improvement, but it doesn't negate his prior arrests or convictions.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use, especially within the last month, could be a factor. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mitigate some risks associated with substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can have various social and economic challenges that might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity or spiritual beliefs can influence behavior, but it's unclear how this specific belief would impact risk without more context.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests and a conviction are significant. The lack of education and possible unemployment risks add to that. Living alone and not being married might mean less supervision. Recent drug use could be a current factor, though he hasn't been depressed lately. Growing up in an urban single-parent household adds social risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these points, the overall risk seems moderately high. However, without more detailed information on the nature of his arrests or how he's using his jobs, it's hard to say if it's a 'high' risk. But given the combination of past legal issues, lack of education, and some behavioral indicators like drug use, I think the confidence is around 70% that this person poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
