Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior issues, but without a conviction, it's not certain. Next, his physical stats: 5'9\" and 185 lbs. Not particularly concerning on their own.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't uncommon, especially if he's independent or maybe struggling with other aspects of life. His education level is lacking\u2014he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Plus, he hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if there's no education or skills to support employment.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent use within the past month makes it more concerning. Drug use is often linked to higher risk behaviors. His mental state: he feels down and nothing cheers him up. That's a red flag for potential mental health issues, which can increase risk.\n\nHe was raised by non-biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent or unstable household can contribute to higher risk factors. Lastly, he doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life. This could indicate a lack of support system or belief in a higher power that might help him navigate challenges.\n\nPutting it all together: arrest history, drug use, mental health issues, unemployment, poor education, and unstable upbringing. These are significant indicators of high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
