Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, though without a conviction, it's not certain if she poses an immediate high risk.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 174 lbs. Not sure how physical stats play into risk assessment beyond maybe indicating potential health issues or stress levels, which could be related to drug use.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might mean she lacks a support network, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor, especially if she's not pursuing further education, which might limit her opportunities and increase stress, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and stability, so having only one job might indicate limited financial stability or motivation, but again, it's context-dependent.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Past drug use is a significant factor; marijuana is a commonly associated drug with criminal activity. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors, including criminal ones.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a blended family in an urban environment might expose her to different influences and stressors that could contribute to higher risk factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God's involvement in her life. Lack of religious belief isn't inherently a risk factor, but it can sometimes correlate with other behaviors, though the connection is unclear.\n\nPutting this all together: arrest history, drug use, lack of education, living situation, and potential stressors from upbringing. These factors could contribute to higher risk, especially considering she's young and has some involvement with the criminal justice system without a conviction. The drug use is a strong indicator, as it often ties into criminal activity. Her current mental state, feeling down, adds another layer of concern for potential behavioral issues.\n\nI think these factors together suggest a high risk, so the prediction should be \"YES\" with a confidence around 70-80% maybe.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
