    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions don't necessarily predict future criminal behavior, though repeated arrests could be concerning.\n\nHis physical description is 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything related to risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might increase some risks, like substance abuse or lack of supervision, but it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes be a protective factor, as higher education might correlate with lower crime rates.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having one job might reduce some risks associated with unemployment or financial instability.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Past drug use is a concern; it's a criminal offense and can indicate higher risk of future offenses.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health isn't directly linked to criminal behavior, but prolonged stress or other issues could be factors. However, without current mental health concerns, this might not be as significant.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable environment can be protective, but the urban setting might expose him to more risks like higher crime rates.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his personal life. Lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently risky, so this factor is neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests, uses drugs, and is enrolled in college with some employment. The lack of criminal convictions, stable upbringing, and current mental health might mitigate some risks. However, the drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if there's a pattern of substance-related issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards a YES because of the drug use history, but I'm not entirely sure without more information on his criminal tendencies or support systems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
