    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction suggests some history of legal trouble, which could be a red flag for recidivism or further issues. But again, I need to consider the context and other factors.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and 185 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything specific in terms of risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest he's independent, but it could also mean he lacks support systems, which might be a risk factor if combined with other issues like criminal history or substance abuse.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level can be a protective factor as higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Being enrolled in college suggests he's working towards something positive, which could mitigate risks.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. Employment is generally seen as a positive indicator, indicating stability and responsibility, which might reduce risk factors associated with unemployment or financial instability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent drug use and current mental health stability are both protective factors that lower the likelihood of certain high-risk behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents\u2014foster or adoptive. This could indicate issues with family support or upbringing, which might be a risk factor if it's associated with neglect or abuse. However, without more details on whether this was a stable environment or not, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor as it may provide social support and moral guidance, which could reduce risk.\n\nPutting all these together: he has a criminal history, but no recent arrests; he's employed and in college, which are positive signs; he's not using drugs or showing depression; he has some family background that might be a risk, but it's balanced by other protective factors like education and employment. \n\nI'm leaning towards this being a low to moderate risk rather than high. The criminal history is there, but the presence of positive factors like education, employment, and current stability suggests that the overall risk isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
