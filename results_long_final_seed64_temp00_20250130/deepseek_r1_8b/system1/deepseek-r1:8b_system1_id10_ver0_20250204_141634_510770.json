    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, which might be relevant in some contexts but not directly indicative of criminal risk on its own. Next, he has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests he's had some legal issues before. That's a significant factor because prior convictions can predict future behavior.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 140 lbs, which doesn't seem to contribute much to the risk assessment. His marital status is single and living alone, which might be common for someone his age but could also relate to potential stressors that might lead to criminal activity.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, indicating he's pursuing further education. This is a positive factor as higher education can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. He's held one job during the year, which shows some stability, another positive sign.\n\nHis drug use is limited to marijuana in the past four years, and he's been feeling down recently. The recent downturn could be a stressor that might increase risk. Living with both parents in an urban area as a child might expose him to different environments or stressors that could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes, which might relate to his belief system and how he copes with stress or challenges. This could be a protective factor if it helps him manage stress positively.\n\nPutting this all together: He's got a prior conviction, which is a strong indicator. His education and employment are positive, but the recent downturn and drug use could be stressors. The fact that he's seeking higher education might mitigate some of these risks. However, the prior arrest and possible stress from feeling down could increase risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a YES because of the prior conviction, even though there are some protective factors like education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
