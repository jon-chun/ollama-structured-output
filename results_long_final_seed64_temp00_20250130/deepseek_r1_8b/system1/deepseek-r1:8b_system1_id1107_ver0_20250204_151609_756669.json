    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have less criminal history but could still pose risks based on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions don't necessarily predict future behavior, but repeated arrests can indicate higher risk tendencies.\n\nHis physical description: 5'8\" and 280 lbs. While obesity can be a factor related to health issues or substance abuse, it's not directly a criminal risk indicator unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but if there are issues in the relationship that aren't mentioned here, it might affect risk differently.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can increase risk factors like unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates.\n\nHe has held 5 jobs in the year. Stable employment is usually a positive indicator, but if these jobs are low-skilled or part-time, it might not provide sufficient economic stability.\n\nHe used drugs (cocaine) in the past four years. Recent drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if there's a history of substance abuse leading to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of current depression might indicate lower immediate mental health risks, but it doesn't account for longer-term issues or other mental health problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of seven in an urban area. Growing up in a large family could provide social support, but urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be associated with lower crime rates, but it varies individually.\n\nPutting this all together: He's young, has some arrests, uses drugs, lacks education, is employed, and lives in an urban area. The drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if there's a history of substance-related crimes. His lack of education could contribute to economic struggles, which might increase criminal tendencies.\n\nHowever, he's married, which can be a stabilizing factor, and he hasn't reported depression recently. The fact that he considers God's influence might suggest some structure in his life, possibly reducing risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of drug use is a significant red flag. Without a history of convictions, it's hard to say if past behavior was criminal due to substance abuse. His current situation includes arrests but no convictions, which could indicate potential for future issues given other high-risk factors like drug use and lack of education.\n\nI think the confidence level here is moderate because while there are several risk factors pointing towards higher risk, some mitigating factors exist, such as marriage and no recent depression. The key factor is the ongoing drug use, which is a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
