Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person has been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. That's a red flag because a history of arrests can indicate higher risk behavior or involvement in criminal activities, even if they haven't been convicted yet.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and 140 lbs. Not sure how physical build factors into risk assessment, but it might relate to potential for violence or other behaviors.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could be a risk factor as it might lead to more criminal opportunities or isolation, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor. It's associated with lower socioeconomic status, which can increase involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which might push someone towards criminal behavior for survival or thrill.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a high-risk factor as it's associated with higher likelihood of criminal behavior and involvement in the justice system.\n\nHe feels down in the dumps all month, nothing cheers him up. Depression can lead to higher risk behaviors as individuals may resort to illegal activities to cope with their emotions.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four. Growing up in a large family might have contributed to environmental factors that increase criminal risk, such as exposure to crime or dysfunctional family systems.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, but if it's tied to a belief that he's being personally targeted, it might indicate higher risk behavior as he may feel out of control.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests without convictions, current drug use, unemployment, lack of education, and emotional distress are strong indicators. His beliefs about God could either be protective or risk-increasing, but given the other factors, it leans towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
