    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. A history of arrests and convictions suggests some involvement with the criminal justice system, which could be a red flag for higher risk.\n\nHis physical description is 6'3\" and 190 lbs. While height and weight don't directly correlate with risk, they might influence behavior or how he's perceived in certain situations.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not always the case.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can be a protective factor; being enrolled in further education might indicate efforts toward self-improvement, which could lower risk.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having only one job might not be as significant as having none or multiple.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of recent drug use and mental health issues like depression are protective factors, reducing the likelihood of certain high-risk behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a non-traditional household could have various effects, but without more context, it's hard to assess its impact on risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his personal life. Atheism isn't inherently risky, so this might not contribute much to risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history, which is concerning. However, he's enrolled in college, employed, not using drugs, and hasn't shown signs of depression. These factors could mitigate the risk associated with his past arrests. Without more severe or recent issues, the overall risk might be moderate rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
