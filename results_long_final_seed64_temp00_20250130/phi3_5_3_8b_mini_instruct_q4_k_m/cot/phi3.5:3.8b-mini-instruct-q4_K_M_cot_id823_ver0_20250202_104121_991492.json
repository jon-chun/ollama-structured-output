She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
