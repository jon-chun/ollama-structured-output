    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism or engaging in criminal behavior. Lacking formal education (no high school diploma/GED) can limit employment opportunities further increasing the likelihood of reoffending due to financial strain or lack of social support systems. The fact that he has held only one job during a year suggests potential unemployment issues, which is another risk factor for criminal activity as it may lead individuals towards illegal means of income generation out of necessity.\n\nThe individual's drug use history and recent feelings of depression could contribute to mental health challenges or substance abuse problems that can exacerbate the propensity toward risky behaviors, including crime if not addressed properly through intervention programs. Living alone at a young age might indicate social isolation which is another risk factor for criminal behavior as it may lead individuals towards antisocial activities due to lack of positive peer influence or support networks.\n\nThe individual's religious belief that God has something to do with his life could be interpreted in various ways; however, without additional context on how these spiritual views impact their decision-making and behaviors (positive/negative), it is challenging to assess this factor accurately for risk prediction purposes alone. Nonetheless, considering the other factors present a moderate level of confidence that there's an elevated likelihood towards high risks in terms of potential criminal behavior or recidivism without intervention and support measures being put into place.\n\nThe score is not at 100 due to some mitigating aspects such as the individual\u2019s age (21 years old), which might suggest a greater capacity for change, rehabilitation programs' effectiveness in young adult offenders or potential positive influences from his religious belief that could be harnessed towards prosocial behavior. However, given all factors considered together and based on available data points indicating risk levels associated with recidivism rates among similar profiles (e.g., criminal history, lack of education/employment), the prediction leans more toward a \"YES\" for high-risk assessment but leaves room to consider interventions that could reduce this level if implemented effectively and timely.\n",
