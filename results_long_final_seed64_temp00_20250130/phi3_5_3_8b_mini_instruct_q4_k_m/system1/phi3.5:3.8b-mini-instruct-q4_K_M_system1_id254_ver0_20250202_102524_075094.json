The fact that she is currently enrolled in school indicates a focus on personal development which can be protective against future criminal behavior. Her lack of drug use and absence of recent depression also reduce the likelihood of substance abuse-related offenses or mental health crises contributing to risk. Additionally, living with others suggests some level of social support network that could further mitigate risks associated with isolation. The individual's religious indifference does not inherently increase her criminal propensity but may suggest a lack of certain protective factors found in communities where religion plays an active role in providing moral guidance and community cohesion. Overall, while there are areas for concern based on past behavioral patterns, the presence of positive mitigating circumstances suggests that this individual does not currently indicate high risk as per available data points provided. The confidence level is set at 30 due to a balanced consideration between her criminal history and current protective factors in place.",
