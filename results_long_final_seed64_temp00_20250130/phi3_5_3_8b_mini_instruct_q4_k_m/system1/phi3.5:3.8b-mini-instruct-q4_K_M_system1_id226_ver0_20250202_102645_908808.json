    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a pattern that could suggest higher risk for future criminal behavior. Lacking education (no high school diploma or GED) significantly increases the likelihood of limited employment opportunities, contributing to potential recidivism due to financial strain. The absence of stable housing and job history further exacerbates this issue by reducing social stability and economic security\u2014both factors associated with higher risk levels for criminal activity.\n\nThe individual's substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) is a notable concern, as it can impair judgment and increase the propensity to engage in risky behaviors or relapse into previous patterns of offending behavior\u2014especially when combined with feelings of depression. The history of living at home during formative years may suggest limited independence but does not necessarily indicate high risk on its own; however, it is a factor that contributes within the broader context of other issues presented herein (e.g., substance abuse and lack of education).\n\nThe individual's belief in divine influence over personal events could be interpreted as either positive or negative depending upon how this worldview affects his decision-making processes, but it is not a strong standalone risk factor without additional context regarding its impact on behavior. Nonetheless, the combination and severity of other factors present here warrant an assessment that leans towards high risk for potential future criminal activity with moderate confidence due to some mitigating variables (e.g., age) but overall a concerning profile based upon available information.\n",
