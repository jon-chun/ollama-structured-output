Additionally, the recent use of marijuana could indicate substance abuse issues that may contribute to higher risks associated with impulsivity or poor decision-making in social contexts. Living alone at such an early age might suggest a lack of supportive relationships and possible isolation which can be risk factors for negative outcomes, including criminal behavior. The individual's feelings of persistent sadness could point towards mental health issues that may exacerbate the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors if not addressed properly through intervention or treatment programs. While education level is generally a protective factor against crime due to increased opportunities for employment, his lack of job history during this period might suggest difficulties with social integration and economic stability which can be risk factors as well. The combination of these elements leads me to predict that there's an elevated but not definitively high-risk probability (75% confidence) based on the information provided without considering other potential protective or mitigating circumstances in his life, such as community support systems, family relationships outside biological parents, and accessibility of mental health services.",
