Living alone at a young age and feeling persistently down may suggest social isolation or mental health issues that can be associated with higher risks for negative outcomes such as substance abuse or criminal behavior in some contexts. The fact he has held one job could indicate potential stability, but the lack of further education might limit future opportunities which are also risk factors to consider. His religious belief may provide a protective factor against engaging in high-risk behaviors; however, without more information on his social support and coping mechanisms, it is not possible to make an absolute prediction with higher confidence. Therefore, the \"YES\" indicates there's some level of risk present but also acknowledges uncertainty due to limited data points (confidence at 65).\n",
