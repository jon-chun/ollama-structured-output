His past drug use (marijuana) suggests potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to risky behaviors. Additionally, the recent feelings of depression may exacerbate these tendencies and increase vulnerability to negative outcomes. While he has held a job during the year which is positive for risk mitigation, his solitary living situation without strong social support networks (evidenced by never being married) could also be considered as an elevated risk factor in terms of isolation-related issues or lacking accountability mechanisms that often come from family ties. The combination of these factors leads to a \"YES\" prediction for high risk, with moderate confidence due to the presence of both negative and mitigating elements (confidence score set at 75).\n",
