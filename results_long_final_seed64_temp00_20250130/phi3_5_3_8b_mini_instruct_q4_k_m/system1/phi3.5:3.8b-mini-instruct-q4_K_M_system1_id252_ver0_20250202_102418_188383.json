Lacking formal education (no high school diploma/GED) can also be associated with limited employment opportunities that may contribute to this increased risk. The fact he has held multiple jobs could suggest instability, which is another potential red flag when assessing for future risks. While the individual reports no recent drug use and a belief in divine influence on his life might indicate some level of moral or spiritual guidance (which can be protective factors), these are somewhat mitigated by other negative risk indicators present within this profile, such as past criminal behavior and educational deficits. The combination of these elements leads to the prediction that there is a high likelihood for future risks; however, without more context or information on support systems in place (e.g., family ties), it's not possible to assign 100% confidence level hence the score at 75%.",
