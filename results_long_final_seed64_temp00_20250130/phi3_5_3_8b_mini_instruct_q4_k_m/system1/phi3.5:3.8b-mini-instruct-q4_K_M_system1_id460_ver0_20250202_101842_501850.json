His drug use over the past four years with substances like marijuana and cocaine further increases his risk profile due to possible addictive behaviors or association risks related to these drugs (additional score: 20). The fact that he has held multiple jobs within a year suggests potential instability in employment, which can correlate with higher reoffending rates (score: 15). His lack of formal education and not being enrolled in college may limit his opportunities for stable income or career advancement. Living arrangements indicate exposure to potentially high-risk environments during formative years; however, the absence of reported depression is a mitigating factor that could suggest better mental health resilience (score: 10). The individual's religious views are not directly linked with risk assessment but can be seen as neutral in this context. Overall confidence level reflects consideration for both risks and protective factors present, resulting in an intermediate prediction of high-risk behavior without being definitively certain due to the lack of conviction history or current mental health status (confidence: 70).\n",
