These include a history of arrest (even without conviction), past drug use within recent months indicating possible ongoing addiction problems, and living alone at an early age in potentially unstable household conditions. The lack of formal education may also contribute to limited employment opportunities or social skills development that could mitigate risk factors further down the line. However, there is no direct evidence pointing towards violent behavior or a history with serious offenses which would increase confidence level; hence 75 out of 100 reflects moderately high concern based on available information but not definitive proof for categorizing as 'high-risk'.",
