    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism according to various studies. Lacking formal education (no high school diploma or GED) further increases this risk as it limits employment opportunities that could lead to more stable life circumstances. The fact he has held only one job in the past year suggests potential unemployment issues, which is another significant factor associated with higher criminal behavior risks. His history of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) also contributes positively towards a high-risk profile since substance abuse can be linked to increased likelihoods for engaging in illegal activities or relapsing into previous behaviors, despite not having felt depressed recently which could have been an additional risk factor. The individual's solitary living situation might also contribute slightly more toward the assessment of high-risk due to potential lack of social support networks that can mitigate risky behavior patterns. However, his belief in a higher power may serve as some protective influence against engaging further criminal activities; thus not reaching full confidence for \"YES\". The assigned 75% reflects the balance between these risk and potentially moderating factors within this individual's profile.",
