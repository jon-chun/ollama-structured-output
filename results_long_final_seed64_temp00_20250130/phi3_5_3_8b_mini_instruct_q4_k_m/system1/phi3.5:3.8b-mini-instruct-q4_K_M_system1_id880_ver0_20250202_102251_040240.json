The person is currently enrolled in school, has held a job during the year, and does not have any history of drug use\u2014all factors that can contribute to lower risk for criminal behavior. Additionally, his religious beliefs may provide him with social support which could mitigate some risks associated with living alone at a young age without extended family nearby in rural areas. The prediction is cautious due to the mixed nature of these indicators and thus reflects moderate confidence rather than high certainty that he poses an elevated risk for criminal behavior based on current information provided.",
