His lack of employment could suggest financial instability that might contribute to this risk. Past drug use is another significant factor increasing the likelihood of continued substance abuse issues without intervention. While he has not been married and lives alone, which can sometimes be associated with higher risks due to isolation or a potential for unstructured time leading to negative behaviors, his current enrollment in school could mitigate this risk somewhat by providing structure and social support through educational institutions. The individual's religious belief may offer some protective factors against engaging in criminal activities; however, the combination of other identified risks suggests a moderately high overall assessment for potential future involvement with crime or substance abuse issues without targeted interventions. Therefore, I have assigned a confidence level that reflects these considerations but also acknowledges some mitigating factors present in his current situation (75 out of 100).",
