Her past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) also contributes to the assessment as substance abuse is often correlated with increased risks related to crime involvement. Although she has not felt depressed recently, her history of arrests suggests a pattern that could continue without intervention or supportive measures in place. The combination of these factors leads me to predict high risk at moderate confidence level due to the presence of significant but non-exclusively indicative elements (e.g., drug use and past convictions).\n",
