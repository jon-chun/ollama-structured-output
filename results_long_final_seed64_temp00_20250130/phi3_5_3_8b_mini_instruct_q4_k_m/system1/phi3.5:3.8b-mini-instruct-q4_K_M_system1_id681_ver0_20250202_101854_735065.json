His employment status is limited to one job during the year, suggesting potential financial instability or lack of engagement in steady work that could mitigate risky behaviors. Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over four years indicates a pattern of substance abuse which can correlate with higher risk for criminal behavior. Although he has not felt depressed recently, his past experiences living at home may have exposed him to environmental factors that could influence future conduct negatively if unaddressed. His religious beliefs might provide some protective factor against engaging in further crime; however, this is often a complex and individualized aspect of risk assessment. The combination of these elements leads me to predict high-risk behavior with moderate confidence due to the presence of multiple concerning factors but also recognizing that there are potential mitigating influences such as religious beliefs or limited past criminal activity (only one arrest).",
