Although he has not been convicted yet, the arrest itself indicates a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. His employment status suggests some level of stability but living alone could also indicate social isolation that might contribute to increased risk factors for negative outcomes. The use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is another significant concern, as substance abuse can be correlated with higher risks in terms of criminal activity or other adverse behaviors. His religious beliefs may provide some protective factor against engaging in crime; however, this does not negate the overall risk posed by his history and behavior patterns sufficiently to lower confidence below 70%. The combination of these factors leads me to predict a higher-than-average but not definitively high level of criminal justice system involvement.\n",
