    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes prior arrest and conviction, which are significant risk factors for recidivism. His lack of employment during the year suggests economic instability or potential engagement in illegal activities to sustain himself financially. Past substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) indicates a pattern that could lead to further criminal behavior if not addressed, especially considering recent use within the past month which may correlate with his current depressive state. The absence of higher education might limit opportunities for legitimate employment prospects in the future. Living conditions such as residing at home during youth and having no religious belief system could also contribute to a lack of social support or moral guidance, potentially increasing risk factors associated with criminal behavior. While there are mitigating circumstances (such as not being married), these combined elements suggest an elevated level of potential for future risks that warrant attention in any assessment process. The confidence score reflects the weight and combination of various identified high-risk indicators, but also acknowledges some uncertainty due to limited information on personal resilience factors or support systems outside those mentioned (e.g., family relationships other than with his biological mother).",
