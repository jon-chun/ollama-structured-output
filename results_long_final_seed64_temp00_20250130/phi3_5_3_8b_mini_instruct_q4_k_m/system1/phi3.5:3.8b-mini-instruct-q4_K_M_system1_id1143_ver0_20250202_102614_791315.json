    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes a prior arrest without conviction, which may indicate some level of risk for future criminal behavior due to potential underlying issues or propensity towards rule-breaking. His lack of formal education and current unemployment status could contribute further to economic strain and social marginalization, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities as a means of survival or expression of frustration. The use of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine is also concerning due to their potential for addiction and association with criminal networks involved in drug trafficking; however, his recent lack of depression suggests he may not be currently experiencing significant mental health issues that could exacerbate risk. The individual's religious indifference might imply a lower likelihood of engaging in prosocial behaviors often encouraged by spiritual belief systems but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior on its own. Overall, while there are several concerning factors present (prior arrest history, substance use), the confidence level is moderate due to some mitigating circumstances such as recent sobriety and lack of depression that could suggest a lower risk for immediate high-risk offending but still indicates potential future risks.\n",
