The absence of convictions is encouraging; however, past arrests alone do not necessarily predict future criminal behavior without considering the nature of these incidents and other contextual details (e.g., severity, circumstances). Additionally, religious beliefs can sometimes provide social support that mitigates risk factors for some individuals. The confidence level reflects a moderate assessment due to mixed indicators; further information would be needed for a more precise evaluation.\n",
