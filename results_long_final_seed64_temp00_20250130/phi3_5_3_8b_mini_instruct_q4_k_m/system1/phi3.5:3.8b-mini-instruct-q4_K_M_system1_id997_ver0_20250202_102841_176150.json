    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes a prior arrest and conviction, which are significant risk factors for future criminal behavior. Additionally, the lack of formal education (no high school diploma or GED) can be associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited employment opportunities that could lead to economic strain and potential involvement in illegal activities as a means of survival. The fact she has held only one job during the year may indicate financial instability, which is another risk factor for reoffending.\n\nThe use of drugs (marijuana) can be associated with an increased likelihood of criminal behavior; however, it's important to note that marijuana usage alone does not necessarily predict high-risk offenses but may contribute when combined with other factors such as economic hardship and a lack of social support.\n\nThe individual has experienced depressive symptoms which could be linked to mental health issues\u2014a known risk factor for criminal behavior if untreated or inadequately addressed through community resources, therapy, etc. The mention that God plays an influential role suggests she may have a strong religious affiliation; while religion can sometimes serve as protective factors against crime due to moral guidance and support networks within faith communities, it is not always sufficient on its own without additional social supports or interventions in place for at-risk individuals.\n\nConsidering the combination of these risk elements\u2014prior conviction history, lack of education, limited employment experience, substance use issues coupled with mental health concerns and a potentially unstable living situation (not alone) \u2014the prediction leans towards \"YES\" indicating high risk for future criminal behavior. The confidence level is set at 75 to reflect the weighted consideration given by these factors while acknowledging that there are mitigating elements such as religious beliefs which could serve protective functions if properly supported and leveraged within a comprehensive intervention plan.",
