The fact she has lived alone since an early age could indicate a potential for social isolation, and her negative outlook on life might affect mental health negatively\u2014all of which are risk factors associated with higher likelihoods of reoffending or engaging in criminal activities. While the individual's current employment status shows some level of stability (having held 3 jobs), it is not enough to offset other significant risks present, hence a high confidence rating for prediction but still leaving room due to potential mitigating factors such as support systems and personal resilience which are unknown.",
