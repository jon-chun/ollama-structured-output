Lacking formal education (no high school diploma/GED) can limit employment opportunities further increasing the likelihood of reoffending due to financial strain or lack of social support systems. The individual's drug use, particularly with substances like marijuana and cocaine that are associated with higher risk profiles for addiction issues, also contributes significantly to their overall high-risk assessment. Additionally, the recent expression of depressive symptoms could indicate underlying mental health challenges which often correlate with increased criminal behavior when unaddressed. The combination of these factors\u2014past convictions, lack of education and employment stability, substance abuse issues, potential for undiagnosed or treated psychological distress, along with a history that suggests limited familial support (given the urban household size) \u2014 all contribute to an elevated risk profile. The confidence level is set at 85 due to these multiple high-risk factors but not absolute as there could be mitigating circumstances and interventions in place which are unknown from this data alone, hence it's less than certainty (100).",
