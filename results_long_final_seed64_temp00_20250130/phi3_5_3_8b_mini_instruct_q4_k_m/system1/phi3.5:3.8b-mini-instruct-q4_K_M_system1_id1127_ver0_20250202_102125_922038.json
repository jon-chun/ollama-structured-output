    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism according to various studies. His employment status shows some stability with holding two jobs during the year; however, this does not negate previous criminal behavior patterns significantly enough on its own. The fact that he has used drugs in recent years could be considered as another potential risk factor depending upon substance abuse severity and frequency of use\u2014though marijuana is less associated with violent crime compared to other illicit substances, it still poses a concern for habitual behavior patterns or underlying issues. The lack of higher education may limit his employment opportunities in the future but does not directly correlate strongly with criminal risk without additional context such as economic status and support systems. Living alone could potentially increase vulnerability to certain types of crime if he is socially isolated, though this factor by itself isn't a definitive indicator of high-risk behavior. The individual\u2019s religious belief may provide some protective factors against engaging in criminal activities due to moral or ethical reasons but does not guarantee low risk on its own without further context about how these values are integrated into his life decisions and actions. Overall, considering the combination of past arrests/convictions with substance use history suggests a moderate-to-high level of recidivism risk; hence, I have assigned confidence at 75 out of 100 due to these factors but also leaving room for mitigating influences not detailed in this profile.",
