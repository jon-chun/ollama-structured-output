    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nI have assessed the provided risk factors and determined a moderate-to-high level of potential risk based on several elements:\n\n1. The individual has been arrested once, which indicates some involvement with law enforcement but without conviction; this alone does not necessarily indicate high criminal propensity but is worth considering in context (confidence score 20).\n   \n2. Living alone at a young age may suggest potential vulnerability or lack of support systems that could influence risk behavior, although it's also possible for individuals to successfully live independently without increased risks (confidence score 15).\n\n3. The individual has held two jobs during the year which suggests some level of responsibility and engagement in society but does not provide clear insight into her criminal propensity or social stability on its own; however, it could indicate financial stress if income is insufficient for living expenses (confidence score 15).\n   \n4. The use of marijuana within the past four years and recent feelings of depression are concerning factors that may correlate with increased risk behaviors or mental health issues which can be associated with higher risks, especially if not addressed properly through support systems like therapy (confidence score 20).\n   \n5. The individual's educational background is limited to a high school diploma and no further education; this may limit her employment opportunities but does not directly correlate strongly with criminal behavior without additional context such as economic status or job market conditions in the area she resides (confidence score 10).\n   \n6. The individual's religious belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes could be a protective factor, potentially providing her some moral guidance and support; however, it is not definitively indicative of low risk without further insight into how these beliefs influence behavior (confidence score 10).\n   \n7. The fact she lived in an urban area at a young age with three other family members might suggest exposure to higher crime rates or social pressures but does not inherently indicate high personal criminal propensity, especially without information on the quality of upbringing and neighborhood environment (confidence score 10).\n   \nConsidering these factors together suggests a moderate-to-high level of potential risk due to past arrest history, substance use issues, recent depression symptoms, limited education opportunities potentially leading to financial stressors, but also some protective elements such as religious beliefs and the possibility that she has adapted well living alone at an early age. The confidence score reflects a balance between these factors with recognition of potential mitigating circumstances not fully detailed in this assessment (totaling 70 out of 100).\n",
