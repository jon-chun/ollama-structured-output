    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes one arrest and conviction, which already indicates a higher risk for potential future criminal behavior compared to someone with no such record. His current emotional state suggests possible mental health issues that could contribute further to the likelihood of risky behaviors if not addressed properly (e.g., depression). The fact he has lived in non-traditional family settings at an early age might suggest a lack of stable support systems, which can be risk factors for delinquency or criminal activity when combined with other stressors like unemployment and low educational attainment without further context on the quality of these experiences. His employment history shows some level of stability (having held 3 jobs), but this is not enough to offset his conviction record significantly, especially considering he has no higher education which might limit job opportunities in more stable fields. The absence of drug use for an extended period and beliefs about a personal connection with God could be protective factors; however, the overall picture suggests moderate-to-high risk due to various intertwined issues that need careful monitoring or support (e.g., mental health services). A confidence level is set at 75 because while there are clear risks present based on his history and current state of mind, it's not definitive without more context about the nature of past offenses, quality of employment experiences, social supports outside family structures, or access to resources for mental health.",
