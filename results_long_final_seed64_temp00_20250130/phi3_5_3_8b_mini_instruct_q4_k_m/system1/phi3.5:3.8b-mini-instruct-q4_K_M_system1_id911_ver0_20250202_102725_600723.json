While there has been one arrest, it was without conviction which may suggest that if he did engage in illegal activity, his actions were either minor or addressed appropriately by law enforcement. His stable employment and lack of drug use are positive indicators suggesting a level of responsibility and self-control typical for individuals not at high risk for criminal behavior. Additionally, the absence of depression is another factor that generally correlates with lower risks in terms of mental health issues leading to crime. The individual's religious belief may provide some social support or moral guidance which can be protective factors against engaging in illegal activities. However, a confidence level at 20 reflects uncertainty due to the limited information provided and acknowledges that risk assessments are complex with many contributing variables not captured herein.\n",
