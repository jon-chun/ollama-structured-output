The lack of convictions indicates no formal adjudication process has taken place against her legal standing. Her stable job history, absence of drug use and depression over the past year point towards a lower likelihood for recidivism or substance abuse-related issues in the near future. Additionally, religious beliefs often correlate with positive social support networks which can be protective factors. The confidence level is set at 30 due to some concerns about her arrest history and lack of formal education but balanced by other mitigating circumstances that suggest a lower risk profile overall.",
