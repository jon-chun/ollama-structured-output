Although there have been no convictions yet, the arrest record alone raises concern about future conduct. Additionally, her lack of steady employment over the past year suggests difficulty in maintaining stable income sources which can correlate with higher risk for engaging in criminal activities due to financial strain or opportunistic behavior. The use of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor that increases personal risks related to health, potential addiction issues, legal consequences if caught using illegal substances again, and possible association with drug-related crimes (even though the current timeframe shows no recent depression or mental distress). The individual's religious belief in divine influence may suggest resilience but does not mitigate other risk factors. Overall confidence is set at 70 due to a combination of these risks, with some uncertainty as there are also protective elements present (e.g., no recent depression), and the lack of convictions means that past behaviors have yet to result in legal consequences or further criminal activity.",
