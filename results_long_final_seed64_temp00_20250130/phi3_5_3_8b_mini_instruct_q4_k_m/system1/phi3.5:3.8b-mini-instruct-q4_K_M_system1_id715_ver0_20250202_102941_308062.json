Additionally, the use of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine in recent years is concerning due to their potential for abuse and legal implications. The lack of formal education (no high school diploma or GED) may limit employment opportunities, potentially leading to financial stressors that could contribute to risky behaviors. Living alone at a young age might suggest limited social support networks which can be risk factors in terms of mental health and safety concerns. However, the confidence level is not set at 100 due to mitigating factors such as religious beliefs (which may provide some form of moral guidance or community), having held multiple jobs indicating potential for adaptability and work ethic, and no reported depression which could suggest a relatively stable mental state currently.\n",
