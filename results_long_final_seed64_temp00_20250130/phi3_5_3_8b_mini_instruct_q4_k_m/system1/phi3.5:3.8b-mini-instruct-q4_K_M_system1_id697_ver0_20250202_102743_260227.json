His lack of stable employment over the past year suggests economic instability that could contribute to illegal activities as means of survival. Past drug use is another significant factor increasing his potential risk profile; although he has not used drugs recently, previous substance abuse can be a predictor for future issues if left unaddressed. Living alone at such an early age without parental support may also indicate social and emotional vulnerabilities that could lead to risky behaviors or reliance on negative coping mechanisms like drug use. The absence of religious beliefs might suggest lower engagement in prosocial community activities, which can be protective factors against criminal behavior. However, the confidence level is not at 100 due to some mitigating information such as his GED certificate and lack of recent depression or substance abuse issues that could potentially reduce risk if addressed properly through interventions like education programs or counseling services.",
