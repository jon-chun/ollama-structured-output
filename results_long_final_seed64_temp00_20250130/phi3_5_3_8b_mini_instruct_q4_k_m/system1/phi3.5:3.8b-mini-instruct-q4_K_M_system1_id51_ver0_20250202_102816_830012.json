This factor alone raises concern for potential future risk behaviors (prediction = YES). Additionally, the lack of employment and education opportunities may contribute to social isolation and economic instability which are known correlates of increased criminal behavior or involvement in risky situations (confidence: 70 - considering her high school diploma but no job history suggests a moderate level of risk due to limited socioeconomic stability). The individual's feelings of depression could also be indicative of underlying mental health issues, which are often associated with higher rates of recidivism and risky behavior (confidence: 70 - considering the significant impact that untreated or poorly managed mental health conditions can have on an individual\u2019s risk profile). The combination of these factors suggests a moderate to high level of potential future criminal justice involvement, hence justification for \"YES\" prediction with confidence at mid-range (70) due to some protective elements like religious belief which might mitigate the risks but not enough to lower overall assessment.\n",
