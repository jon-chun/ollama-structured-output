Lacking formal education (no high school diploma/GED) can limit employment opportunities further increasing the likelihood of reoffending due to financial strain or lack of social support systems. The fact that she has held multiple jobs within a year suggests potential instability, which could correlate with higher risk levels for criminal activity as well. Substance use (marijuana and cocaine) is also associated with increased risks in terms of addiction-related offenses or impaired judgment leading to illegal activities. While she has not felt depressed recently\u2014which might be a protective factor against some criminogenic behaviors\u2014the combination of these factors, especially the criminal history and substance use without intervention measures like treatment programs in place (not mentioned), leads me to predict that this individual is at high risk for future offenses. The confidence level reflects consideration given to her current stable living situation but acknowledges significant concerns based on other presented risks.",
