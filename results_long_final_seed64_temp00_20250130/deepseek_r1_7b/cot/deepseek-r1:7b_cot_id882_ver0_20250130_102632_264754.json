Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues, but since it's just one data point, maybe it doesn't add much weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That's not a lot of history, so probably low risk from that factor alone.\n\nHis height and weight aren't relevant to recidivism as far as I know, so those can be ignored.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014maybe some factors here could relate to stability, but since he's young, it might not show much yet.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is usually a good indicator; having a degree might correlate with lower recidivism because of better job opportunities or higher self-esteem.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014job experience can be positive if stable, but since he's young, maybe it's okay.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong risk factor for reoffending. Even if he hasn't felt depressed recently, past use could mean he might relapse or try harder now.\n\nNo depression in the past month\u2014this seems positive, but I'm not sure how recent that is compared to his drug use history. Maybe it's a mitigating factor.\n\nGrowing up with both parents in a household of four\u2014he had a stable environment as a child, which usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better support and less exposure to stressors.\n\nBelieving in God\u2014his spirituality might influence his behavior, but I don't know if that directly affects recidivism rates. It could be more about personal motivation than risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The main red flags are the drug use (high risk) and maybe the lack of a strong support system as an adult? Wait, he's living alone without parents nearby anymore. Maybe that's a bit of a risk factor because isolation can lead to issues. But his job experience is positive, and education level is good.\n\nSo overall, I think there are some moderate factors here. The drug use might be the strongest indicator pointing towards high risk, but other factors like living alone could add up to medium. So maybe the prediction is YES with a confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"He has one arrest and no conviction, which suggests minimal criminal history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, indicating stable educational background.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"He used marijuana in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"support system\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after leaving home may indicate some isolation risk, though it's mitigated by having a job and education.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
