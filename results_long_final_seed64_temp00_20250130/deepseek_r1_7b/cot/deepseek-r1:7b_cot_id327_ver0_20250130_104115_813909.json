    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can affect outcomes based on race. So that might be a medium weight factor because it adds some risk without being the highest.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That's not a huge issue yet, so maybe low weight since it's just an arrest, not a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here, so probably low weight.\n\nNot married and living with someone else isn't directly related to recidivism, so another low factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. That's a significant barrier because education can influence job opportunities and stability. So this should be a medium weight.\n\nShe's worked four jobs in the past year. Having some work experience is good, but four jobs might indicate she's been inconsistent or maybe not stable enough to prevent recidivism. Maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana before and recently felt down. Substance abuse can contribute to relapse after incarceration, so this should be a high factor because it directly relates to potential triggers for reoffending.\n\nYoung age at 18 with living in a household of ten suggests she might have experienced neglect or abuse. That's a red flag and probably a high weight factor.\n\nBelieving in God could indicate a more stable family environment, which is positive but maybe not as relevant here since it's about risk factors related to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Drug use (high), past living conditions (high). The rest are lower. So the prediction would lean towards high risk with confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Her single non-convicted arrest may indicate some prior instability, but without a conviction, it's not immediately concerning.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with someone else and being unmarried do not directly correlate to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"These factors are unrelated to criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities, contributing moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Four job transitions in a year could indicate inconsistency but not necessarily higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Recent Emotionality\", \"high\", \"Drug use (especially marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood are significant risk factors for relapse.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Conditions\", \"high\", \"Living with ten family members at age 18 in an urban area suggests potential neglect or abuse, significantly increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may indicate a stable environment but does not directly correlate to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area.
