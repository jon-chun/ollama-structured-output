    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She's Asian/Pacific Islander, which might influence her recidivism rate compared to others, but I don't know enough about that yet. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest but no conviction. That's a red flag because even if it's not a conviction, it can still affect her chances of getting re-arrested. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and weighs 115 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly contribute to recidivism unless there are other factors related to health, but she doesn't mention any health issues here. So probably low impact on the risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might help prevent recidivism if she has someone to turn to for help or advice. But since she's single and not in a relationship, maybe it slightly increases risk because she might struggle with emotional support during tough times. So perhaps medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because people are more likely to seek help if they have the means and resources. So this should be low risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Having work experience can provide stability, so that's probably low risk as well.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. That might indicate she's trying to manage substance use, which could be a positive sign. However, she felt down during the last month and couldn't find anything to cheer her up, which suggests she might struggle with mood management or substance use again. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHer past living situation: At a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of four. That's a stable environment initially, but it's now just her living alone. Maybe the transition from a larger family to living independently could lead to challenges like feeling isolated or having less supervision, which might increase risk slightly.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This is more of a personal belief and doesn't directly impact recidivism unless it affects her behavior, but I don't see how religious beliefs would cause reoffending. So probably low or no effect on risk.\n\nPutting this all together: The one arrest without a conviction is significant (medium). Drug use with recent relapse signs (medium). Past living situation (medium). Everything else seems to be positive except maybe the drug use and living arrangement, which are medium each. \n\nI think her overall risk might be medium because she has some factors that could lead to issues but also several strong protective factors like education and stable work history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest without a conviction, which can increase the risk of reoffending despite not being convicted immediately.\"),\n    (\"past drug use\", \"medium\", \"She used marijuana in the past four years but felt down recently, indicating potential triggers for relapse.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after living with both parents in a household of four may lead to isolation or lack of supervision, increasing risk slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
