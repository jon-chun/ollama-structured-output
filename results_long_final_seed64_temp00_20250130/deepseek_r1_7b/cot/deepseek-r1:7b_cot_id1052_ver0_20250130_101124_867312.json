    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it doesn't show conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the system. So maybe that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 199 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism much unless there's something about his behavior related to his size, but nothing here suggests that. So probably low risk from this factor.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living with family can provide support, so living alone might increase stress or isolation, which could lead to higher risk. Maybe medium here.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education level is definitely a big factor. Without a degree, he might not get job training or support, increasing his chances of reoffending. That's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability, so maybe this lowers the risk. But if he's been unemployed for most of the time, that could be worse. I'm not sure how to weigh this yet.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause, but it can lead to other issues like addiction or stress. Since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe the risk is lower than if he were. So perhaps medium here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 5 in a household of five. That's a lot of siblings; maybe he was exposed to a lot of family dynamics. If he had issues there, it could affect him later. Maybe medium or high?\n\nHis belief in God: He thinks God is involved in his life. Some people find comfort in religion, but others might feel it affects their behavior negatively. I'm not sure how strong this factor is. Maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of a degree and being unemployed could be the biggest factors pushing him towards high risk. His living situation with five family members might also add stressors. The arrest, even if not convicted, adds some risk too. The job history isn't great either; three jobs in a year but maybe not stable.\n\nSo overall, I think he's at a medium to high risk. Considering all factors, especially education and unemployment, it leans towards high. But his living situation might temper that a bit. Maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one non-convicted arrest, which may indicate past involvement with the judicial system but no prior conviction, potentially affecting future stability and willingness to re-offend.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can provide a sense of independence, reducing stressors that might increase recidivism risk compared to living with family or others.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with not being enrolled in college, may limit access to resources and support systems necessary for successful reintegration and prevention of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs in the past year suggests some level of stability, though unemployment for most of the time could indicate difficulty maintaining steady employment and retraining efforts.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use without recent feelings of depression may not directly contribute to recidivism but could be a precursor to other issues that might affect behavior over time.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with five family members at a young age could expose him to various stressors or dynamics within the household that might influence his behavior and decision-making in the future.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God's involvement may provide comfort but does not inherently correlate with increased risk of recidivism unless it leads to negative behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
