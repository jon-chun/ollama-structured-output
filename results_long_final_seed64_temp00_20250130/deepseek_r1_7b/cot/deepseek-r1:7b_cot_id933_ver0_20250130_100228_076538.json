    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias, but since it's not mentioned as a significant factor in recidivism studies, maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That might be a medium risk because even though it's an arrest, he hasn't been convicted yet, so maybe the risk isn't too high.\n\nHis height is 6'0\" and he weighs 185 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics are typically considered in recidivism assessments unless there's something about his behavior related to weight, but nothing here suggests that, so probably low.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse or partner. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because he might not have support for substance abuse or other issues, so maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a big factor. Not having a degree could increase his risk of engaging in risky behavior again, so that's probably high.\n\nHe has one job during the year. Having some employment can help with stability, but only one job might mean he relies on it too much or isn't seeking additional support, which could be medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive factors that reduce risk, so low weight here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five. That's a lot of siblings; maybe it indicates family issues or more supervision, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism directly. Maybe medium because larger families sometimes have different dynamics.\n\nBelieving in God has something to do with his personal events. This is subjective and might relate to his mindset, which could be low weight unless it's a significant factor for him personally affecting his behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Medium risk factors like no education, living alone, one job, and past arrest. Some low factors but not enough to tip the scales high. So overall prediction would be medium, maybe leaning towards low confidence because of the mixed factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a single non-convicted arrest, which could indicate potential for reoffending but not necessarily a high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support networks and increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as substance abuse or illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with not being enrolled in college, can significantly impact an individual's ability to reintegrate into society successfully and avoid further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job may provide some stability but could also indicate reliance on that income source without exploring additional avenues for support or change.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression\", \"low\", \"The absence of drug use in the past four years and no recent depression suggests a positive behavioral history, which can reduce risk factors associated with substance abuse or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a household of five indicates potential family support but may also suggest ongoing family dynamics that could influence behavior indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"While religious beliefs are personal, they do not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless they play an active role in daily decision-making, which is not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
