He's been arrested six times but not convicted, which is a red flag because more arrests usually mean higher chances of reoffending. His height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about his personal circumstances.\n\nHe's living alone, which might make him feel isolated. Being in a household of four when he was younger could have contributed to his unstable environment. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so maybe he struggled with education, which can lead to poor job opportunities and higher crime rates.\n\nNot working during the year is another point\u2014lack of income support might make him turn to drugs as a coping mechanism. His drug use in the past four years, especially recently, could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHe feels very down emotionally these days and can't find joy in anything, which might affect his judgment or ability to form positive relationships. His religious beliefs about God influencing his life could either provide some stability or create internal conflicts if they're not aligned with his personal values.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors like multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, living alone, and recent drug use all point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested six times but not convicted, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"unstable_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four at a young age may have contributed to instability and could influence current behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"education_and employment\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED, combined with not working during the year, suggests limited opportunities for stability and positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Heavy use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, particularly in the last month, indicates ongoing substance abuse which is strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"emotional distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and without joy may affect judgment, relationships, and overall well-being, potentially leading to impulsive behaviors or decisions that could result in criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
