Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's white. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but since we don't have that info, maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That might be a medium risk because even though it's not a conviction, it could mean he's struggled with the system before.\n\nHis height is 6'2\" and he weighs 210 lbs. Weight can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates in some contexts, but without knowing his BMI or other factors, maybe this is low weight.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there are family issues, which we don't know about here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Education can be a significant factor in recidivism because lack of education might lead him to engage in criminal activities. So this is probably medium weight.\n\nNot working during the year could mean he's relying on other means for support, maybe drug use, which ties into his next point.\n\nHe used cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse can be a strong indicator of future issues because it can affect judgment and increase crime rates. So this is high weight.\n\nYoung age at 19 with a history of living with five people in an urban area could mean he's been exposed to a lot, which might contribute to risky behavior. Medium weight here.\n\nConsidering his lack of faith in God, maybe he has different motivations or less anchored values, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism directly. Maybe low weight for this factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are substance use (cocaine) and possibly the urban environment. Medium factors include prior arrest, education, living situation, no job. Low factors are race, height/weight, lack of faith.\n\nSo his overall risk is probably medium to high because of the substance abuse and past issues. The prediction would lean towards YES for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest which could indicate past involvement in the criminal system, potentially signaling a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests limited educational opportunities, which may contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of cocaine over the past four years is a significant factor indicating potential substance abuse issues, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"past behavior\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment during the year could indicate reliance on other means (e.g., drugs) for support, potentially leading to further involvement in criminal activities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
