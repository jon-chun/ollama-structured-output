    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased juvency systems. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe the impact isn't as strong here.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a mitigating factor because not getting convicted could reduce her risk compared to someone with a full conviction.\n\nHer height is 5'5\" and weight 158 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics directly affect recidivism unless there's something about her behavior related to her weight, but she hasn't been using drugs recently, so that might not be an issue here.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk because she might have fewer support systems around her. But again, it depends on other factors like her mental health and job situation.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is usually a good predictor of lower recidivism. People with higher education tend to have better job opportunities and skills that can help them reintegrate into society.\n\nShe's worked three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs, especially part-time or full-time, generally shows responsibility and supportiveness, which are positive indicators for not reoffending.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong mitigating factor. Drug abuse is a known precursor to recidivism, so her clean behavior lowers her risk.\n\nShe felt down recently but couldn't find something to cheer her up. This might indicate some mental health issues or low self-esteem, which could increase her risk of reoffending if she's struggling with these feelings again.\n\nHer early life was in a household of two when young. That's not necessarily bad unless there were family issues that affected her later behavior, but without more info, I'll assume it's neutral.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This could relate to her mental health or spirituality influencing her behavior, which might be a positive factor if she's seeking help.\n\nPutting this all together: mitigating factors like no conviction, education, job stability, and clean behavior are strong. The negative factors like living alone and recent low mood aren't as strong but still present. I think the risk is on the lower end but not extremely low. Maybe a medium risk because there's room for her to improve but also some support that could help reduce recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Her one non-convicted arrest may suggest she has the potential to reintegrate positively into society without further complications.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"high\", \"Having held three jobs during the year indicates a stable lifestyle and support system, which can aid in avoiding recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Indicators\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood may indicate underlying mental health concerns that could influence her behavior if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests she has the skills and knowledge to seek better opportunities, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of sobriety and self-control, further reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to isolation, but her job stability may provide some support.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may suggest she is seeking spiritual guidance, which could positively influence her behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
