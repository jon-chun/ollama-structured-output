    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old Black male rearrest within three years. He's got a few factors that might contribute to his recidivism.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history but it's not a conviction\u2014just an arrest. That could be a red flag because even though he hasn't been convicted, having an arrest on his record can make him a risk. I think that would lean towards high risk because it shows some past behavior that might lead to more issues.\n\nHe's got a body weight of 185 lbs and is 5'9\". Not sure how that factors in directly, but maybe if he's struggling with health issues or substance use, his weight could play a role. But since the main issue here is drug use, I'm not sure about this one yet.\n\nHe's living alone without a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That means he might have less support system around him, which can be risky. Maybe he doesn't have someone to help him if things go wrong, so that could increase his chances of reoffending.\n\nHe used drugs for four years but especially the past month when he felt really down. That's concerning because drug use is a known factor in recidivism. The recent use might mean he's more susceptible now or has triggers that make him use again.\n\nHis early life was tough\u2014he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area at a young age, and he doesn't believe in God. That could contribute to his unstable home environment and lack of faith, which are known predictors of recidivism. Plus, living in an urban area might mean less supervision or more exposure to negative influences.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple risk factors like past arrest, drug use, lack of education, living alone, and a troubled early life. These all point towards high risk. I'm pretty confident about this prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest which can indicate past behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance use, especially recent marijuana and cocaine use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education or GED may reduce support networks and opportunities, contributing to higher recidivism rates but not as directly as other factors like drug use or family background.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can isolate an individual, leaving them more vulnerable to environmental stressors and potential triggers that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a non-biological family in an urban area at a young age, combined with the absence of religious belief, can create a challenging upbringing that may contribute to criminal behavior and risk-taking behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
