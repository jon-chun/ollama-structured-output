    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested twice and convicted once before. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 260 lbs, which might indicate some health issues or maybe substance use problems since he's in the heavier category. His living situation is alone, so no support from family or friends, which could contribute to isolation and increased risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't college enrolled, which might mean limited opportunities for betterment or less access to resources that could help him avoid trouble again.\n\nOnly one job during the year suggests he's not very stable economically. Unemployment can lead to stress and substance use as a coping mechanism, so that's another red flag.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, especially marijuana recently. Drug use is a major risk factor for reoffending because it increases impulsivity and tolerance, making him more likely to engage in criminal behavior again.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might have had both positive and negative influences. Urban environments can expose him to various risks but also offer opportunities. However, living with someone could mean less supervision or exposure to family dynamics that might contribute to substance abuse.\n\nConsidering God's influence on his life adds a personal risk factor. Religious factors can sometimes lead to self-inflicted harm if he feels the need to cope through illegal activities when stressed.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), weight and health issues (medium), living alone (medium), limited education and job (low), drug use (high), family background (medium), and personal spirituality (medium). The high factors from prior convictions, drug use, and family background probably tip the risk towards high. So I'd predict a YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of criminal behavior with prior convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Individual has used drugs in the past four years, especially marijuana recently, which is a major risk factor for recidivism due to increased impulsivity and tolerance.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and lack of support, increasing stress and potential substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \"Individual has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college and only held one job during the year, which may limit opportunities for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Experienced living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area, which can have both protective and risk factors contributing to substance abuse and isolation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
