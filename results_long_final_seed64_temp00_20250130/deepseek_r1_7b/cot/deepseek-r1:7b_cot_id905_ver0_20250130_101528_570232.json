    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Black male. He's been arrested twice but not convicted, which is a point against him because prior convictions are usually indicators of higher risk. His weight is on the higher end, maybe indicating some health issues or substance use, but he hasn't used drugs in four years, so that's positive.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which might mean less support system. He has a high school diploma and isn't college-bound, so maybe not as motivated to change his situation. Having three jobs is actually good because it shows responsibility and stability.\n\nHis lack of recent depression suggests he's mentally stable. His early life was in a household of five with his biological mother; that could have had both positive and negative influences. He believes in God, which might be a strength or just a personal belief without evidence of behavior issues.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests are a red flag but not convicted yet. Weight is moderate, no drug use, stable living situation, job history, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. I think the factors lean towards medium risk because while he has some negatives like past arrests and living alone, he also has positives that could mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having two prior arrests but no convictions may indicate a history of minor offenses which can be concerning for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight_class\", \"low\", \"His weight is within a moderate range, suggesting he may not have significant health issues related to substance abuse given his drug-free status over the past four years.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse could indicate less support network which might contribute to higher risk of recidivism but does not necessarily confirm it.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"With a high school diploma and no college enrollment, he may lack motivation or resources to change his situation which could be associated with lower risk of reoffending compared to those with more education or training opportunities.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"high\", \"Having held three jobs during the year suggests a stable work history which is generally protective against recidivism as it indicates financial responsibility and employability.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month along with no recent drug use points towards good mental health, reducing risk factors associated with substance abuse or mental instability that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of five with his biological mother may have had both positive and negative influences which can contribute to recidivism risk but does not confirm it without further context about family dynamics or support systems.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing in God is generally associated with good character and moral values, which could be protective against recidivism rather than a contributing factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
