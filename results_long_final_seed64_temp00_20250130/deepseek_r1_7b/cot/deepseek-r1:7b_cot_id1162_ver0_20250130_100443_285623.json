    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Hispanic. I know that race can influence recidivism rates, but it's not the only factor. She has one arrest but no conviction, which is a mitigating factor because convictions are more impactful than just being arrested.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so maybe they're low risk factors here. She's never married and isn't living alone, which might indicate she's in a relationship or has support, but I'm not sure how that affects her re-arrest rate.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which is actually a positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and reduce recidivism. She only held one job last year; maybe she's looking for more stable employment, so low risk there.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't directly linked to recidivism unless it leads to further issues like substance abuse disorders or illegal activities. Since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe she's managed her use better, so perhaps medium risk here.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of four in an urban area could mean she has less support and might face higher stress or instability, which could increase risk. However, urban environments sometimes have more resources for help, so it's a bit tricky\u2014maybe medium to high risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which might affect her motivation towards positive change but isn't directly tied to recidivism stats. So probably low impact on the risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest without conviction is a minor issue. Drug use could be a concern if it's leading to issues, but she's managed it recently. Living in an unstable household might increase risk slightly. She has good education and isn't alone, which are positive signs. So overall, I'd say low risk with some factors pointing towards medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"low\", \"Her single arrest does not result in a conviction, which is a mitigating factor as convictions have more significant impacts on recidivism rates compared to mere arrests.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Recent\", \"medium\", \"She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.
