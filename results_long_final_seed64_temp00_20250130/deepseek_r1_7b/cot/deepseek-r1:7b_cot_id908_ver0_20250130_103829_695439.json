    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it doesn't show a conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the system. I think that could be medium weight since it shows past interaction but no real consequence beyond arrest.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 178 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct risk factor unless there are health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe low weight for this factor.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living with family can provide support, so that might actually be protective. Maybe low or even no impact on risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level matters because higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. So this could be a protective factor, maybe medium weight since it's just high school without college.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is generally good for reducing recidivism as it provides stability. Maybe low to medium weight here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only). Drug use can have both positive and negative effects. Since he's not currently using, maybe this factor isn't as strong. But past use could indicate potential relapse, so perhaps medium weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's a good sign because mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates. So low weight here.\n\nYoung age at 18 and living with his biological mother in a household of four. Young age can be a risk factor as it might indicate less life experience, but being raised by family could offer support. Maybe medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nBelieving in God for guidance. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without specific evidence of problematic behavior influenced by religion, maybe this is low weight.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest (medium), no significant living arrangements (low), education level (medium protective), job held (low to medium), past drug use (medium), no depression (low), young age with family (medium), and religious belief (low). \n\nThe overall risk seems somewhat low because of the protective factors like education, job, and not feeling depressed. However, there's still a potential for risk from past arrest and drug use. So maybe a medium to high risk? Wait, but considering all factors, it might lean towards low or slightly higher.\n\nWait, I think I need to weigh each factor more carefully. The one-time arrest is significant because even if not convicted, it can affect future opportunities. Drug use in the past four years could indicate potential relapse. Lack of college education and only one job might limit support systems. \n\nSo maybe the risk factors are medium or high? But considering the protective factors like education and no depression, perhaps it's a low to medium risk.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should assign each factor as low, medium, or high based on their impact. Then sum them up for the prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"One-time arrest\", \"medium\", \"Past involvement with the judicial system may indicate potential recidivism risk despite no prior conviction.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living with family can provide support, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma\", \"medium\", \"Higher education levels are typically associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"One Job\", \"low\", \"Employment provides stability and may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use could indicate potential for relapse but does not necessarily correlate directly with recidivism without current substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent depression is a positive indicator of mental health and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living at 18 years old in a household of four may offer some protective factors but also potential challenges associated with young age.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God for guidance is generally not directly linked to recidivism risk without evidence of problematic behavior influenced by religion.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
