    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Black male. He's been arrested three times but not convicted, which is a red flag because being arrested multiple times without a conviction can indicate past issues with the law.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 245 lbs. That might be relevant in terms of physical risk or how he interacts socially, but I'm not sure yet. He's living alone, so maybe he doesn't have support which could increase his chances of reoffending.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe less education could mean he's less likely to get better job opportunities that might help him stay out of trouble. But sometimes lack of education can also be a motivator for criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held one job recently, which is good because having stable employment can reduce stress and provide a sense of purpose. But maybe the fact that he's only held one job could mean he's not very experienced or has inconsistent work history.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use might be a minor issue here, but it's something to consider because substance abuse can lead to other issues like health problems or family conflicts.\n\nHe feels that God is involved in his life. That could indicate a strong moral compass, which might reduce recidivism risk. Alternatively, if he's struggling with sin, maybe that's a concern, but I don't have enough info on that.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That suggests he was raised in a multi-parent environment, which is usually protective against recidivism. Urban living might mean more exposure to crime or social issues, but the size of the household could provide stability.\n\nPutting this all together: He has multiple arrests without convictions, which is a strong negative. His living situation with his mother and urban area are positive factors. Education level is average, job history is minimal, and he's not in college. Drug use isn't severe, but he feels connected to his faith.\n\nI think the key factors here are the past arrests and maybe the lack of support from family or community. The other factors don't seem to tip the scales enough to change that assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested three times without a conviction indicates potential past issues with the law, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce support and stability, slightly increasing risk but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not attending college may limit opportunities for positive development, slightly increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year provides some stability, reducing risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years but not feeling depressed recently does not significantly impact risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area suggests strong family support and a protective environment, significantly reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Feeling that God has something to do with his life may indicate a strong moral compass, slightly reducing risk but not significantly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
