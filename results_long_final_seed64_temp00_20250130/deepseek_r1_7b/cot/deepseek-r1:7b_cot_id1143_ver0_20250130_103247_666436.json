    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Hispanic male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's only been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a positive because at least one offense hasn't resulted in a conviction. But since it's an arrest, maybe there's some underlying issue that wasn't resolved.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and weighs 130 lbs. Weight can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, especially if he's underweight or overweight, but without knowing his BMI or other health factors, I'm not sure how much this affects him directly.\n\nLiving alone is a neutral factor because living situation itself isn't inherently bad unless there are issues like lack of support or substance abuse in the household. But since he was raised by both parents at a young age in an urban area, maybe that's more about his family background than his current living situation.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a significant risk factor for recidivism because without it, he might not have the skills needed to find stable employment or make responsible decisions later on.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job experience can be both positive and negative. Having a job shows some responsibility, but only one job in a short period might indicate limited opportunities or instability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Drug abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal behavior, family dysfunction, and health issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health isn't directly tied to recidivism, chronic depression or other mental health issues could be indicators of deeper problems that might contribute to reoffending.\n\nHis young age (21) is a bit concerning because younger individuals sometimes have less life experience and may make impulsive decisions. However, he was raised in an urban area by both parents at a young age, which might suggest a stable upbringing initially but could also indicate potential family dysfunction or other issues that might affect his current behavior.\n\nHis lack of religious affiliation (\"God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\") is interesting. Some studies suggest that religious support can help in reintegration and reducing recidivism, so this absence might be a negative factor.\n\nPutting it all together: He has one prior arrest but no conviction, which could mean he's not fully responsible for past actions. His lack of education and job experience are significant negatives. Drug use is definitely a red flag. The young age and family background might have some mitigating factors, but the drug use and lack of education seem like strong indicators.\n\nI think his risk is high because multiple key risk factors point towards potential reoffending. The presence of drug use, lack of education, and limited job history all contribute significantly to the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but no conviction, which may indicate incomplete responsibility for past actions.
