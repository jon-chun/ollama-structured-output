    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested five times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Generally, more arrests mean higher recidivism risk because there's a history of breaking the law again.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism much unless it relates to other factors like substance use, which he does have here.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but since he's not married and isn't with anyone stable, maybe that's a medium factor because being single might mean less supervision or support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, so he has an educational barrier which could contribute to recidivism as education sometimes plays a role in job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse and other negative behaviors that increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently felt down for extended periods. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential relapse or continued substance abuse, which can affect job performance and legal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. That's a family environment, but if it was chaotic or neglectful, that could be high risk. However, the fact that he considers God involved might suggest some level of support or guidance, so maybe medium here.\n\nReligious involvement: He believes in God and thinks it affects his personal decisions. This could provide some stability compared to someone with no religion involved, so perhaps a lower risk factor than if there was no religious support.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor contributes positively to the risk of rearrest. The prior convictions are high, drug use is medium, unemployment is medium, living alone or not married might be low but still contributing, and family environment could be medium with some positive influence from religion. \n\nSo overall, considering all these factors, I'd predict a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (5) and a conviction indicate a history of breaking the law, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent feelings of low mood, suggests ongoing or relapsing substance abuse, which can impair judgment and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment during the year may lead to dependency on substance use or other negative behaviors, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse indicates some level of independence, but this factor is less significant compared to others like prior arrests and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four at a young age may have had challenges that could contribute to higher risk, though the involvement of religion might provide some protective influence.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
