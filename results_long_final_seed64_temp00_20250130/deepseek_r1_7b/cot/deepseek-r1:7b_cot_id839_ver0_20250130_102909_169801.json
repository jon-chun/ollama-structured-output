    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but since we're focusing on his personal factors, maybe it doesn't add much weight.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's definitely a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future crimes or reoffending.\n\nHis height is 6'1\" and he weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics directly affect recidivism unless there's something about his behavior tied to his weight, but nothing here suggests that.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Living situation can sometimes be a factor in recidivism if it's unstable or if he has support systems, but since he's not living with anyone else, maybe it's less of an issue.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is important because higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. But since he's not enrolled, maybe that's a point against him if he might be more likely to drop out or engage in risky behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can contribute to substance abuse and other negative behaviors, which could increase his risk of reoffending.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently felt down for a month without anything to cheer him up. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to more criminal behavior or increased risk-taking.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area at a young age. That's concerning because living in such an environment might have led to neglect or abuse, which could contribute to his current behavior and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might not have strong spiritual support, which can sometimes be linked to substance abuse issues or a lack of motivation towards positive change.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history, drug use, living in an unstable household, and other factors like unemployment and no job. All these point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"He has one prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Not being employed may lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, especially marijuana and cocaine, along with feelings of low motivation, suggests ongoing substance abuse issues which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"unstable living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four in a rural area at a young age may have led to neglect or abuse, contributing to his current behavior and increasing risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
