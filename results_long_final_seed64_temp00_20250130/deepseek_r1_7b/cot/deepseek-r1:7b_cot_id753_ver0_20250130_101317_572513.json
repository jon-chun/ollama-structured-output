    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearresting within three years. He's white, has two arrests and a conviction, is 6'0\" and weighs 230 lbs. He's living alone, not married, no high school diploma or GED, only one job in the past year. He uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine) both in the past four years and especially recently, feeling really down for the last month.\n\nHe lived with his parents at a young age in a household of four, which might indicate some family support but also maybe instability. His religious beliefs don't seem to play into his personal issues now.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age and Previous Convictions**: He's 19, so still quite young. Having two arrests and a conviction suggests he has a history of criminal behavior, which is a red flag. Young adults with prior convictions are often seen as more likely to commit new crimes.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially recently when he's feeling down, could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance use can impair judgment, increase risk of accidents or violence, and may contribute to recidivism.\n\n3. **Living Situation**: Living alone at 19 might mean he doesn't have a support system. If he's not married and has no children, maybe he's less likely to get support from family in the future. However, living with parents as a child doesn't directly correlate to living alone now unless there was a significant life change.\n\n4. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED means he might have limited opportunities and could be more prone to engaging in risky behaviors if not motivated enough by better prospects.\n\n5. **Employment**: Only one job in the past year suggests he's either unemployed or underemployed, which can lead to financial stress or lack of stability that might contribute to recidivism.\n\n6. **Mental Health Symptoms**: He's feeling down for a month without any specific mention of treatment. This could indicate underlying mental health issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates as untreated mental health can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors that stand out are the prior convictions, drug use, lack of education, unemployment/underemployment, and possible mental health issues. These are all strong indicators of a higher risk for rearrest. \n\nI think each of these contributes significantly. Prior convictions alone might be medium to high weight because they directly correlate with recidivism. Drug use is definitely high since substance abuse is a major factor in reoffending. Education level and employment status are both low individually but together could moderate the risk, perhaps pulling it down slightly.\n\nHowever, considering all factors, especially the prior convictions and drug use, I would lean towards a high relative weight for each of those. The overall prediction should be YES with high confidence because multiple strong indicators point to him being at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of criminal behavior, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase risk of violent or impulsive behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of education may limit opportunities and contribute to risky behaviors if not addressed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Unemployment or underemployment can lead to financial stress, which might be a contributing factor but is less directly linked compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for an extended period without treatment may indicate potential mental health issues that could contribute to risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
