    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even if she's not getting convictions, it could mean she's struggling with her charges or maybe has some mental health issues affecting her ability to serve sentences. So that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 140 lbs. Her weight is below the BMI for black women around her age, which might indicate she's underweight. Underweight individuals can sometimes have weaker bones, which could be a risk factor for rearrest due to falls or other injuries. So that's another medium risk.\n\nShe's living alone and not married. Living alone increases vulnerability to domestic abuse or neglect, both of which are serious issues leading to higher recidivism rates. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means she has limited education, which can lead to lower job opportunities and higher chances of engaging in risky behavior again. That's another high risk.\n\nShe only held one job during the year. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism because it leaves fewer resources for support after release. So that's a high risk factor too.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, but she hasn't felt depressed recently either. While depression can contribute to criminal behavior, her lack of recent issues might suggest she's mentally stable. Maybe this isn't as strong a risk factor, so perhaps low.\n\nShe lived in a household of six at a young age. Larger households are often associated with higher crime rates and poorer living conditions, which could have long-term effects on her ability to reintegrate successfully after release. That's high risk.\n\nLastly, she believes in God. While spirituality can sometimes correlate with good behavior, it doesn't directly indicate lower risk. So maybe this is low or neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium for being arrested three times, high for living alone and family history, high for education gaps, high for joblessness, medium for drug use (but no recent issues), high for past household size, and low for spirituality. \n\nSo the overall prediction would lean towards high risk because most factors are pointing that way. Maybe 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of three arrests but no convictions, which may indicate ongoing legal issues or potential mental health challenges affecting her ability to serve sentences effectively.\"),\n    (\"Underweight BMI\", \"medium\", \"Living below the recommended BMI for her demographic could imply underweight status, potentially increasing risks related to physical injuries or falls.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone and Single Parent\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to domestic abuse or neglect, both of which are significant contributors to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Limited Education\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors post-release.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job during the year may leave her with limited resources for support after incarceration, potentially leading to increased risk factors.\"),\n    (\"No Recent Drug Use\", \"low\", \"The lack of drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator, though recent feelings of depression do not directly correlate with criminal behavior but could suggest mental stability.\"),\n    (\"Large Household at Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of six at a young age may have contributed to higher crime rates and poorer living conditions, which can have long-term effects on her ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not directly correlate with lower risk but may suggest personal stability rather than criminal tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
