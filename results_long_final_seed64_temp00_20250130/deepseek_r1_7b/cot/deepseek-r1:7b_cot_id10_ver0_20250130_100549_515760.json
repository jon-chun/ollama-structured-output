    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but since it's not mentioned, maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's a moderate risk because one offense isn't severe yet, but it shows some criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so probably no impact here.\n\nNot married and living alone\u2014maybe living situation affects support systems, which could be low or medium risk depending on the area.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if it's leading to better opportunities, but maybe not directly related here.\n\nHe worked one job last year. Employment history usually helps reduce risk, so that might be low.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before and recently felt down. Drug use can be a sign of substance abuse which is a risk factor\u2014maybe medium or high depending on the context.\n\nLiving with four parents in an urban area at a young age could mean he was exposed to a lot of stress, which might increase risk factors like anxiety or depression indirectly.\n\nConsidering God's role\u2014he seems religious. Some people find support from religion, but others struggle with it. This is more about personal belief and might not directly affect recidivism unless there are issues with mental health tied to his beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest and drug use seem significant. Drug use could be a medium risk factor because it's related to substance abuse which can lead to other issues. The living situation doesn't add much, so maybe low or medium depending on the area. Education is positive but not directly relevant here. Employment is good but again, not directly tied.\n\nSo overall, considering the one prior arrest and recent drug use, I'd lean towards a high risk because of the potential for relapse. The other factors don't add much to either side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction which indicates some criminal history but not severe.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
