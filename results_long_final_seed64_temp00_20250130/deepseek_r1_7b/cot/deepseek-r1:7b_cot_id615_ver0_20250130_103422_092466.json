    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young, but he's already been convicted twice. That's a significant point because recidivism tends to be higher in younger individuals who have prior convictions.\n\nHe identifies as White, and I know that race can influence recidivism rates, often due to systemic issues like over-policing or socioeconomic disparities. But since he has two prior convictions, the weight of those convictions might overshadow any potential racial factors here.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, which doesn't seem directly relevant unless there's a genetic component I'm not considering. Similarly, his weight at 165 lbs isn't immediately indicative without more context on how it affects his behavior or health.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors because he might be less likely to seek help or support from others. But since he's a young adult, this factor might not be as significant as other points.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school or college can lead to lower educational opportunities and might contribute to substance abuse or unstable living situations. This is definitely a medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it doesn't immediately jump to high unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can lead to dependency on substance abuse, lack of skills for finding new employment, or unstable living conditions. This is another medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) suggests he's been involved in substance abuse. Substance abuse is a known predictor of recidivism because it can impair judgment, lead to impulsive behaviors, and contribute to criminal behavior. This should be considered high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not feeling depressed might indicate some level of mental health, if he's been using drugs, this could mask underlying issues or self-image problems that might affect his behavior. However, without more info on his mental health history, it's hard to gauge, so maybe medium.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. This suggests he was raised in a stable environment initially but now lives alone. Urban areas can have different social dynamics and potential for higher crime rates, which might influence his current behavior. However, since he's 21, the impact might be lessened.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, which might affect his decision-making regarding substance use or seeking help. It's another medium factor because it doesn't directly correlate but can influence behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (high), drug use (high), living alone and being young with limited job and education (medium each). The lack of religious support is medium, and the past household environment might be low unless combined with other factors. \n\nSo overall, considering the high risk from prior convictions and drug use, along with medium factors, I'd lean towards a high prediction but maybe not certain due to some mitigating factors like his age and living situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior convictions which significantly increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"age_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 years old may contribute to lower stability but does not immediately indicate high risk without additional factors like joblessness or education issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and not enrolled in college can limit opportunities and potentially lead to unstable situations that may correlate with higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month could mask underlying mental health issues, but without more information, it's hard to gauge its impact on behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
