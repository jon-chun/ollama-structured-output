That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs, which is on the heavier side but not extreme. Weight can sometimes be an indicator in risk assessment, especially if it's related to substance use or other factors he has mentioned.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence his support network; being alone might mean less supervision and more exposure to negative influences.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a big risk factor because people without education often have fewer job opportunities and may engage in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate stability, but if he's been through some tough times, maybe it's less stable than expected. However, three jobs isn't bad on its own.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a red flag because substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or increased risk of other crimes.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a setting might have had both protective and negative effects, but it's something to consider as potentially influencing his behavior.\n\nBelieves in God, which is a positive factor often associated with moral guidance, but he's still at risk because other factors like substance use are more influential here.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (high), unemployment or lack of education (medium), living alone (medium), substance use (high). The high factors might outweigh the medium ones. So I'd lean towards a high relative weight for each factor, leading to a higher risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to prior convictions which indicate past behavior that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unemployment_or_education_level\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk as he has no high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, indicating potential instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk because living alone can reduce supervision and increase exposure to negative influences which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"High risk due to marijuana use and recent lack of depression feelings, which can lead to impulsive behaviors or increased risk of other crimes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
