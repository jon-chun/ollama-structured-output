    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a first-time offender with no prior convictions. That usually means lower recidivism risk because she hasn't been convicted before. So that might be low or medium.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. GED holders can sometimes face similar challenges as degree holders but might have better job opportunities. Not being enrolled could mean she's looking for more education, which is positive. Maybe this factor is low.\n\nLiving alone at 19 seems concerning because young adults often go through identity formation issues when living away from home. This could indicate instability or a lack of support, so that might be medium risk.\n\nShe has a history of substance use\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse can lead to other issues like addiction, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism. That's probably high.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood affecting her ability to work or engage with others could indicate mental health issues. This could be another high factor because it might influence her behavior and willingness to seek help.\n\nShe was raised in a household of three by both parents in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can sometimes lead to emotional challenges, which might contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors. That's medium but could push towards high risk if combined with other factors.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life adds a positive aspect, possibly indicating strong moral guidance or support systems. This might mitigate some risks, so maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior offense is low, GED and education status are medium, living alone is medium, substance use is high, mood issues are high, family background is medium, and religious involvement is low. The high factors (substance use and mood) likely outweigh the others, leading to a high risk prediction with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"First-time offense without prior convictions\", \"low\", \"Her lack of prior conviction suggests she may be motivated to change her behavior rather than continue past patterns of conduct.\"),\n    (\"GED and not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"While having a GED can present challenges, not being enrolled in college might indicate a desire or need for further education which could aid in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living alone at 19\", \"medium\", \"Living independently at such an early age may signal potential instability and lack of support, which are concerning factors for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Substance use (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years\", \"high\", \"Past substance use is a strong indicator of potential ongoing issues that could lead to further criminal behavior or difficulties in maintaining stable relationships and employment.\"),\n    (\"Recent feelings of low mood affecting daily functioning\", \"high\", \"Mood swings can impact decision-making, work performance, and social interactions, all of which are critical factors in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household of three with both parents in urban area at young age\", \"medium\", \"Early family dynamics, especially in an urban setting, could contribute to emotional challenges that might influence substance use and other risky behaviors over time.\"),\n    (\"Religious involvement indicating God's role in her life\", \"low\", \"Religious belief often provides a sense of purpose and support which can positively influence behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
