    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like education or substance use here.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's not a lot, but it does indicate some criminal history which could be a red flag.\n\nHis height is 5'11\" and he weighs between 225-249 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height are typically considered in risk assessments unless there's something specific about his condition, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he's young, maybe it's less of an issue compared to older individuals who might have more established networks.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or college could increase the risk because education is often linked to better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability can influence financial independence and overall well-being, so having just one job might be a negative factor.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but no recent depression symptoms. Drug use itself is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues which can affect behavior and recidivism.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents at a young age in an urban area, in a household of four. Growing up in such a context might have had some protective or negative effects, but since it's an urban setting, maybe there are more resources available compared to rural areas.\n\nHis belief in God could be a positive factor as spirituality often correlates with better outcomes, but I'm not sure how significant that is in risk assessment models.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest and GED without college, job issues, drug use. These factors seem to point towards higher risk. The presence of a drug history might tip it over the edge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and one conviction, indicating some criminal history which can be a significant factor in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"ged_status\", \"low\", \"He has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college.
