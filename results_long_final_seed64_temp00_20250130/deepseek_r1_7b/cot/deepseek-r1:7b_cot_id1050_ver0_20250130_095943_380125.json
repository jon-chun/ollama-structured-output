    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old Hispanic male rearresting within three years. He has a history of two arrests and one conviction. That's already concerning because recidivism is higher among individuals with prior convictions.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise red flags about his weight or health, but maybe it could relate to substance use if he's heavier than average for his height. He hasn't been married and lives alone, so social support might be lacking, which can increase recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked with lower recidivism rates because it provides skills and opportunities that can help avoid incarceration. His job history shows he's worked five jobs in a year, which could indicate instability but might also show adaptability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently felt down for months without anything to cheer him up. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which can lead to further legal problems or self-harm, both of which increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area suggests he was raised in a household that might have had challenges, possibly leading to behavioral issues. Believing in God could be a positive factor if it provided guidance and support, but sometimes religious beliefs can also lead to risky behaviors if they interfere with personal responsibility.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high risk. Drug use is a significant factor. Unstable living situation and lack of education contribute as well. His recent emotional low might indicate deeper issues that could affect his ability to reintegrate successfully after incarceration.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of two arrests, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood without any positive triggers indicate potential substance abuse issues that can lead to further legal problems or self-harm, both of which increase the risk of recidivism.\"), \n    (\"unstable_living\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no support network may contribute to instability but does not directly correlate as strongly to recidivism as prior arrests or substance use.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities for positive change, increasing the risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area.
