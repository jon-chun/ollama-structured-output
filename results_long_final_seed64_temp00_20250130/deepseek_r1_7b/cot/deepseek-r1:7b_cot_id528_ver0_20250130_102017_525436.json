    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Hispanic male rearresting within three years. He has a history of five arrests and five convictions, which is pretty significant. That's a lot of prior Incivis, so that should be high risk.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't know if his weight affects recidivism much, but maybe his height does? Not sure, but it doesn't immediately jump out as a red flag.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, so no family support which could help him stay out of trouble. That might be medium risk because he has no support network to turn to if he gets into trouble again.\n\nNo college enrollment despite having a GED. Maybe he's not seeking further education or training, which could contribute to recidivism. So that's another medium factor.\n\nHe only held one job in the past year. Unemployment for so long might mean he doesn't have skills to find new work, making him more likely to end up back in a job that leads to issues. That's high risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can lead to more impulsive behavior and higher crime rates if it's chronic. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Sometimes substance abuse can lead to mental health issues, but he doesn't seem to be experiencing depression now. Maybe this is a medium factor because while he's using drugs, he's not showing signs of mental health problems yet.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in such a large family might have had some challenges, but it doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism unless there were issues within that household. Since no other factors are mentioned about family dysfunction, maybe this is low risk.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. That's more of a personal belief and might not directly impact his criminal behavior but could influence his motivation or mindset indirectly. Maybe medium risk because it doesn't provide clear information on his behavior patterns.\n\nPutting all these together: five arrests, living alone, no college, one job, drug use, and young age in an urban household. The high factors seem to dominate here. So I'd predict a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Incivis\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of five arrests and five convictions, indicating significant criminal behavior that could predict higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce family support, which can be a contributing factor to increased risk but not the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Not enrolled in college despite having a GED, which might indicate a lack of commitment or opportunities for further education and training that could aid in reintegration and prevention of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Only held one job in the past year; unemployment can lead to economic instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities such as drug use or other illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known substance abuse that can increase impulsive behavior and crime rates, contributing directly to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month; while drug use can sometimes lead to mental health issues, there is no indication of current mental health problems affecting behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
