    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male with five prior arrests and convictions. That's a lot, which is definitely a high risk factor because recidivism tends to run higher for those with multiple offenses.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and weighs 185 lbs. I don't think his physical characteristics are directly related to recidivism unless there's something about his behavior that's influenced by his size, but nothing in the info suggests that. So maybe this is a low factor.\n\nNot being married and living alone... Hmm, living arrangements can sometimes be linked to higher risk if they're unstable or if he has other issues like substance use. But without more info on his living situation's stability, I'll consider it as medium because it could contribute but isn't the main issue here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a big factor in reducing recidivism. Without education, especially if he's not completing it, that's a red flag for low to medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability can affect recidivism because having a steady income can reduce stress and provide motivation to change behavior. Having just one job might mean he's struggling or underemployed, which could be a medium factor.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana in the past four years and recent substance use. Drug abuse is a major risk factor for reoffending. It increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe felt down often recently, which might indicate underlying mental health issues. Mental health can contribute to recidivism if not addressed, so that's another medium factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Growing up in such circumstances can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nBelieving in God as part of his personal life. While spirituality can influence behavior, it doesn't directly correlate with higher or lower recidivism rates unless there's evidence of sin or moral issues, which isn't provided here.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior arrests (high), drug use and recent mental distress (medium each), living situation possibly contributing but not the main issue. Education and job factors are negative too. So overall, it seems like a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending due to established criminal behavior and history.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history (marijuana in past four years, recent substance use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism.
