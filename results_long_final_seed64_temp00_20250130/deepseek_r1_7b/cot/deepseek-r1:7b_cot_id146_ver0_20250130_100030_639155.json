    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism. So that's high risk right there.\n\nShe's only 5'7\" and weighs 135 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor unless it's related to substance use or health issues, which she hasn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since she's not in a relationship or with family, maybe that's a medium factor? Not sure yet.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college, so she has some education but isn't continuing her studies. Education level is usually a good predictor; having it might lower recidivism, but she's not enrolled now. Maybe medium risk here?\n\nShe's held five jobs in the past year. That suggests she's adaptable and maybe has some work experience, which could be positive. But sometimes job instability can lead to other issues.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is a strong risk factor because it can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. However, since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe that mitigates some of the risk? Maybe medium here.\n\nShe feels influenced by God. Religious factors can sometimes provide support or structure, which might help with recidivism. So perhaps low to medium risk from that perspective.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are a big yes (high). Drug use is also high but maybe mitigated by recent feelings of depression? But she's not feeling depressed now, so maybe still high. Living alone and never married could be medium or low depending on other factors. Education level might lower the risk slightly.\n\nI think overall, her prior convictions and drug use are strong indicators pointing towards a high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Past arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly in the past four years, is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless other factors like instability are present, but in this case, it seems stable as she has never been married and feels influenced by religion which may provide support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment might suggest some educational stability, but it's not a strong protective factor compared to prior convictions or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Holding five jobs in the past year indicates adaptability and work experience, which can be positive factors that may reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
