    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated. She has one arrest and no conviction, so maybe that's not too bad yet.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 115 lbs. That doesn't seem relevant to recidivism risk directly. Maybe if she was underweight or overweight, but here it's just average.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence her ability to get help after being released. But since she's not married, maybe that's a neutral factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is usually associated with lower recidivism because people with higher education are more likely to find stable jobs or further their goals. So this could be low risk.\n\nShe held 3 jobs in the past year. Job stability can contribute to lower recidivism, so having three jobs might indicate she's been employed and maybe has some financial stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for reoffending, especially if it's linked to street-level activities or higher crime rates. Since she hasn't used drugs recently, this could be a positive sign.\n\nHer mood: most of the past month she felt down and couldn't get cheered up. This might indicate low motivation, which can lead to underengagement in efforts to reintegrate into society. Low motivation is a risk factor for reoffending because it reduces the likelihood of seeking help or staying employed.\n\nYoung age at arrest (she's 22) and living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Being young might mean she's still developing life skills, but being raised in an urban environment can expose her to higher crime rates or unstable environments, which could be risk factors.\n\nShe believes in God, so religious factors aren't directly relevant here unless it affects her personal behavior, which isn't indicated.\n\nPutting this all together: The low job stability (though she has three jobs) might not be enough. Her recent lack of drug use is positive, but her low motivation and living situation could increase risk. She's young, so maybe she hasn't had time to build a strong support network yet.\n\nI think the factors lean towards medium risk because while some positives are present (education, job history), there are notable negatives like low motivation and living in an urban environment with potential for higher crime.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age at Arrest\", \"low\", \"Her being 22 years old may indicate limited life experience, which could be a risk factor as she may not have developed essential life skills yet.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area with a household of four might expose her to higher crime rates or unstable environments, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Mood and Motivation\", \"high\", \"Most of the past month she felt down and couldn't get cheered up, indicating low motivation which can reduce efforts to reintegrate positively into society, thus a risk factor for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not enrolled in college may indicate limited opportunities or focus on other areas, which could be a risk factor as it might affect her ability to find stable employment or further her goals.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
