    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even if she's not convicted, it could mean she has some issues that led to her being in trouble again. So maybe medium risk from that.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 115 lbs. Her weight is below the BMI for her height, so she's underweight. Underweight individuals might have lower self-esteem or health issues which could contribute to substance use. That seems like a low but contributing factor, maybe pushing her towards medium risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates because people might not get the support they need. So that's another medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or going to college can limit opportunities and might make her less likely to find stable employment, increasing risk of reoffending. That's definitely a medium to high risk.\n\nNo job experience during the year could mean she's not actively seeking help or trying to improve her situation. That's another point towards higher risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse, especially with both marijuana and cocaine, can lead to health issues and behavioral problems, which might make her more prone to further criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month. While not feeling depressed isn't necessarily good news, sometimes people recover from depression. But if she's using drugs, maybe she's dealing with stress or other issues that could lead to more risky behavior. Maybe medium risk.\n\nYoung age and living with both parents at a household of four might have had some challenges. Younger siblings can sometimes cause problems, but it also shows she has support which is positive. So maybe this lowers the risk slightly.\n\nConsidering God's influence on her life suggests she may be religious or seeking moral guidance, which could help in avoiding criminal behavior. That's a low to medium factor.\n\nPutting all these together: Medium to high risk because of drug use and lack of support despite some mitigating factors like living with parents and having a GED.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having two arrests, even without convictions, can indicate underlying issues that may reoccur.\"),\n    (\"Underweight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is below the BMI for her height, which might relate to self-esteem or health issues affecting substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Isolation can lead to increased risk of recidivism due to lack of support and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"GED without college enrollment\", \"high\", \"Not completing high school or attending college may limit future opportunities and increase reoffending chances.\"),\n    (\"No job experience\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment could mean missed support and reduced motivation for positive change.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana, cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor linked to behavioral issues and potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"medium\", \"While not feeling depressed now, past drug use might indicate stress management issues that could lead to risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household of four with living parents\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents shows some support, which can be a mitigating factor in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious influence\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role may provide moral guidance and reduce criminal tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
