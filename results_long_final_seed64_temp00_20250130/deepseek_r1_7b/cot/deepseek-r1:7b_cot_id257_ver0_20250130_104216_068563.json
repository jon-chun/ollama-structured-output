    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's got one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad because it's just an arrest, not a conviction. But maybe it shows some past behavior that could indicate future issues.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 120 lbs. Her weight is below the BMI for being underweight, which can sometimes lead to health issues. If she's struggling with weight, that might affect her ability to handle substance use or other risks.\n\nLiving alone means she doesn't have a support system. That could be both good because she's responsible but also bad if she's dealing with mental health issues without someone to help.\n\nShe's in school, which is positive. Education can lead to better job opportunities and reduce recidivism. But maybe the stress of school could contribute to other issues.\n\nTwo jobs during the year might indicate some flexibility or financial stability, but it could also mean she's not focusing enough on personal responsibilities if she's juggling work and school.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana, shows some substance abuse. The recent feelings of low mood might be related to that or something else. Substance abuse can lead to other criminal behaviors or increased risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, living with six people could have been chaotic. That environment might have contributed to her current issues, like drug use or mental health problems.\n\nConsidering her religious beliefs as a factor is interesting but probably not directly related unless she's facing some internal conflict that's affecting her behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest isn't a big red flag, but the factors like living alone, substance abuse, and past unstable environment could increase the risk. I'm leaning towards high risk because of these multiple issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past arrest\", \"low\", \"Her one arrest may indicate prior behavior that could be a precursor to further issues but does not necessarily guarantee recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can increase the likelihood of engaging in other risky behaviors or seeking help, which might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"recent mood state\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for an extended period could indicate underlying mental health issues that may escalate into more serious problems, increasing the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"past household size\", \"medium\", \"Living with six people at a young age suggests past family dynamics that might have contributed to her current behavior, potentially making her more prone to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Her religious beliefs may provide a sense of purpose but do not directly correlate with increased risk unless there is internal conflict affecting her behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
