    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. Young adults often have more flexibility and might not be as committed to long-term criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism rates compared to other factors.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race plays a significant role here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him specifically. Since he's only one conviction, maybe it's just one incident and not a long-term problem.\n\nHis height is 6 feet, which isn't unusual for an adult male, so that probably doesn't influence his behavior directly. Weight between 175-199 lbs seems normal; no indication of being overweight or underweight, which might relate to substance use but he's only using marijuana recently.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase stress or substance use, but it doesn't directly point to criminal behavior unless there are other factors.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment suggest some level of education, which is generally associated with lower recidivism because educated individuals may have better job opportunities and life skills. Plus, he's working two jobs, so maybe stable income contributing to lower risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could be a red flag. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors or other issues that might contribute to recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe the impact is less severe.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to substance use, but if he's not feeling it now, perhaps he's managing his situation better. But I'm not sure how depression ties into recidivism directly unless it's part of a larger issue.\n\nAt a young age, living with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area might have had some stressful experiences or family issues that could affect his behavior later on. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates and stress, which might influence recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering God's involvement in his life suggests he has a strong moral framework, which might deter criminal behavior. However, personal beliefs don't always directly translate to safer behaviors unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has a stable background, education, job experience, but has some drug use and living with multiple family members in an urban area. The presence of substance use is a moderate risk factor, while the other factors seem to mitigate risk. So I'm leaning towards low risk but not zero.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults often exhibit more flexibility and less commitment to long-term criminal behavior compared to older individuals, which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence experiences within the justice system, this individual's case does not indicate systemic issues affecting his specific background.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"No direct impact on criminal behavior as height is unrelated to such factors.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Normal weight range; no indication of obesity or underweight that could correlate with substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, but without evidence of stress or substance abuse, it does not directly point to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma suggests a stable educational background which is typically associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Employed two jobs; stable income can contribute to lower risk by providing economic stability and reducing impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana Only)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use, particularly marijuana, may lead to impulsive behaviors or other issues that could contribute to recidivism but is not severe enough to be high risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No evidence of recent depression; managing current situation better might suggest lower stress levels which can correlate with safer behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Urban Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of six in an urban area could have had stressful experiences that may influence behavior later on, though without specific issues, it's not a high risk factor but still moderate to consider.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Strong moral framework which might deter criminal behavior unless there are deeper underlying issues not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
