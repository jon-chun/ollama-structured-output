    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even if she's not convicted, it could mean she has some issues that led to her being in trouble again. So maybe medium risk from that.\n\nShe's 5'1\" and weighs 155 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism much unless there's something about her health, but nothing here suggests she's unhealthy. So probably low impact on risk.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone. Maybe she has family support? Not sure if that affects her ability to get help or stay out of trouble. I'm leaning towards low risk from this factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can sometimes reduce recidivism, but it depends on whether she's using it. Since she's not in college, maybe she's looking for other opportunities which could be risky. So medium risk here.\n\nShe's held seven jobs during the year. That seems like a lot of work experience, which might indicate stability. But if she's switching jobs frequently without proper support, that could lead to instability and higher risk. Maybe medium again because it depends on her situation between jobs.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, but only some of the time during the last month. That's concerning because drug use can lead to impulsive behavior or more criminal activity when she's under the influence. High risk from this factor.\n\nHer feelings of low mood for much of the month could be related to substance abuse. If she's feeling down without a good reason, it might indicate she needs help but isn't getting it. That would increase her risk. High here too.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area at a young age. That's a tough spot. Being raised by multiple relatives could mean she doesn't have strong support networks or access to resources, which might push her into trouble again. High risk from this factor.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with her life. That could lead to a lack of spiritual guidance and support, which are important for dealing with personal issues and avoiding criminal behavior. High risk because she's not getting the kind of support that might help her change her trajectory.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium from being arrested three times, medium from job history, high from drug use, high from mood issues, high from living in a tough household, and high from her lack of belief in God. So overall, I'd say she's at high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (3 times but not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested multiple times without a conviction can indicate underlying issues that may reoccur, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight (5'1\\\"/155 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No significant health indicators are present; height and weight alone do not directly correlate with recidivism risk without additional context about health status or lifestyle factors affecting them.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Never married, not living alone)\", \"low\", \"Living independently may suggest a lack of family support, but this factor alone does not strongly indicate increased risk without further context on personal circumstances or social networks\"),\n    (\"Education (High school diploma, not in college)\", \"medium\", \"While education can reduce recidivism, not pursuing higher education might signal instability or focus on other areas that could be risky if not properly utilized or supported\"),\n    (\"Job History (7 jobs in a year)\", \"medium\", \"A high job turnover rate may indicate instability; however, it does not necessarily correlate with increased risk without evidence of substance abuse or other negative behaviors affecting her ability to maintain stable employment\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and cocaine use, recent mood issues)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior.
