    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it doesn't show a conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the system. I think that could be medium weight since it shows past interaction but no real consequence beyond arrest.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 134 lbs. Weight alone probably isn't a big factor unless there are other health issues mentioned, which there aren't. So maybe low weight here.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living with family can provide support, so living alone might increase the risk of isolation or stressors leading to recidivism. That could be medium weight as it's not a direct cause but an environmental factor that contributes.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level matters because higher education is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled might mean she's less motivated, so maybe low weight here since it's protective.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year. Having some employment history can be positive as it shows stability, but working two jobs suggests she's managing her time well. I'm not sure if that's a risk factor or protective; perhaps medium because it might indicate she's handling other responsibilities, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues, which are known predictors of recidivism. So this is definitely a high weight factor as it directly relates to potential behavioral issues.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood for much of the month might indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors. This could be another high weight factor because mental health problems can contribute to substance use and other risk behaviors that lead to recidivism.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a setting might have had both protective and negative effects, but given the context, it's hard to say without more info. Maybe medium weight because it could relate to family support or potential abuse, which can go either way.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a strong indicator of personal spirituality. Spirituality often correlates with better self-discipline and healthier coping mechanisms, so this might be low weight as it's protective.\n\nPutting all these together: high risk factors are drug use (high), recent mood issues (high). Medium factors include past arrest (medium), living alone (medium), job history (medium). Low factors are education, spirituality. So overall, the risk is high because of the significant negative factors outweighing the positive ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating past involvement with the judicial system which could be a mitigating factor but does not guarantee lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to increased stress and isolation, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests some level of stability but may lack higher education's protective benefits.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Employing two jobs shows practicality but does not directly correlate with reduced risk, indicating manageable work-life balance.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years and recent substance abuse can significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism due to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"recent_mood_state\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for much of the month may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age could have both protective and negative influences, making it a medium factor.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believing in God is generally associated with better self-discipline and healthier coping mechanisms, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
