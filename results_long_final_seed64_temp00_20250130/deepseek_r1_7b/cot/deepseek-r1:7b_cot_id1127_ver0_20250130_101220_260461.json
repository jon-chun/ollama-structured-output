That seems like a strong indicator of past issues, so maybe high risk.\n\nHe's got a body type that might be associated with higher crime rates in certain areas, but without knowing where he lives or the specific crimes, it's hard to say. His living situation is solitary, which could mean he's less likely to get support and more exposed to criminal activity\u2014so medium-high risk.\n\nNo college education despite having a high school diploma might put him at a disadvantage economically and socially, increasing his chances of engaging in risky behavior again\u2014another medium-high factor.\n\nHe's employed two jobs but hasn't felt depressed recently. Maybe he's stable enough not to get involved in illegal activities\u2014but that's a bit of a balancing act; maybe it's low risk compared to other factors.\n\nHis drug use history is only marijuana, which might be less severe than other drug uses, so perhaps lower risk from that angle. But his past living arrangements with both parents at a young age could mean he has some support or stability, but also potential exposure to family issues\u2014so maybe medium-low.\n\nReligious involvement suggests he's seeking help, which is positive, but if he's still struggling, it might not be enough on its own\u2014maybe low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: high from past convictions and body type; medium-high from living alone and education; lower from drug use and family background. The overall prediction leans towards high risk with a confidence of 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating past criminal behavior which is a significant indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age and living situation\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone at a young age in an urban area may increase exposure to criminal activities without support, contributing moderately to the risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college or employed despite two jobs suggests limited educational opportunities which could influence risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"Drug use only includes marijuana and has not felt depressed recently; this may indicate lower risk compared to other factors like past convictions.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium-low\", \"Living with both parents at a young age in an urban area suggests some level of family support but also potential exposure to family issues which could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"religious involvement\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role in his life may indicate seeking spiritual guidance, which is generally associated with lower risk behaviors compared to other factors like past convictions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
