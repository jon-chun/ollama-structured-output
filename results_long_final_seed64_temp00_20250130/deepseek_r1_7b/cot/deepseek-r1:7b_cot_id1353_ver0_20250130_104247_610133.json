    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested three times but not convicted, which is a red flag because being arrested multiple times without getting convictions can lead to more criminal history and maybe higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 170 lbs. Weight alone doesn't tell me much about his risk unless I consider if he's underweight or overweight for his height, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect his stability; maybe he's in a place where he feels unsafe or has limited support, which could increase his risk of re-arrest.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school can sometimes lead to more unstable situations, but it also shows some level of education, so maybe that's a mitigating factor compared to someone without any credentials.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences might indicate he's been through various environments, which could be both positive and negative. It shows adaptability but might also mean he's had inconsistent work or bounced around jobs, which can affect his stability.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some of the last month. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to criminal behavior if it's a habit.\n\nHis young age and living with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area might suggest he was raised in an environment that could be emotionally neglectful or harsh. Plus, being in a rural area where there are fewer resources for support can mean less access to mental health services or substance abuse treatment, which are important for avoiding recidivism.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral guidance but doesn't directly correlate with lower recidivism risk unless he actively uses religion to cope with issues. If it's just a belief without action, maybe it's not as strong of a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, drug use, living in an unstable environment, and being young can all contribute to higher recidivism risk. The factors seem to point towards a high risk of re-arrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested three times without a conviction, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down during the last month, indicating possible substance abuse which can impair judgment and increase risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network may contribute to instability but does not directly correlate with high risk without additional factors like living in a rural area or neglectful environment.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Family History\", \"high\", \"At 21, he is still young, which can be a risk factor.
