    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it doesn't show a full conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the system. So that could be medium risk.\n\nShe's Hispanic, which isn't directly a risk factor, but sometimes minority groups have different recidivism rates, so maybe low impact here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to her criminal behavior or likelihood of reoffending.\n\nLiving alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that could help her stay out of trouble. So that's another medium factor.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED, which can limit opportunities and increase stress, leading to substance use. That's definitely a high risk because substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe only held one job during the year. Unemployment for so long could lead to dependency on drugs as her main source of income, making her more likely to relapse. High risk here too.\n\nDrug use in the past four years and recent drug use makes me think she's struggling with addiction. Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism, so high risk again.\n\nShe experienced trauma at a young age, living in a household of four in an urban area. That exposure could lead to mental health issues or substance abuse, both linked to higher chances of reoffending. High risk.\n\nHer lack of belief in God might affect her coping mechanisms and decision-making, possibly leading to more impulsive behavior. Medium to high risk depending on how that affects her.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium for arrest, low for ethnicity, medium for living alone, high for education, high for unemployment, high for substance use, high for trauma, medium for lack of faith. The strongest factors are substance abuse and trauma, which push the prediction towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a single non-convicted arrest, indicating past involvement but not a full conviction, which could suggest potential recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Her Hispanic background is not inherently linked to higher recidivism rates compared to other groups, though it may be a minor consideration without specific data.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living independently may reduce support networks that could aid in avoiding criminal behavior or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Her lack of a high school diploma or GED increases her dependency on alternative income sources, such as drugs, which is linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Only holding one job for a year may lead to long-term unemployment, potentially resulting in substance abuse as a means of coping with stress and financial strain.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, especially recent relapse, significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in similar behavior again, contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Trauma History\", \"high\", \"Exposure to trauma at a young age can lead to mental health issues or substance abuse, both of which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Her lack of religious belief may influence her coping mechanisms and decision-making, potentially leading to impulsive behavior that could contribute to criminal acts.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
