    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So I'll assign this a high weight since it's a strong indicator of past criminal behavior.\n\nShe weighs 130 lbs at 5 feet 5 inches, which is below the typical adult weight range but not extremely low. However, her height and weight alone don't directly indicate recidivism risk without considering other factors like prior convictions or living situation.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor in some cases, especially if she's stable, but combined with prior arrest, it might not be as strong of a protective factor here. I'll consider this as medium weight because while living alone is positive, her prior arrest negates much of that.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; without a diploma, she's more likely to engage in risky behaviors again. This factor should be high weight because lack of education significantly increases the risk.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate stability and self-sufficiency, which are protective factors. However, if she lost her jobs recently due to arrest or other issues, this might not hold. I'll assign medium weight here as it's a positive factor but context-dependent.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014suggests substance abuse, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors and increased crime rates. This should be high weight because drug use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe feels down and has been feeling this way recently. Emotional distress or low mood can sometimes correlate with substance use but might also indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed. I'll assign medium weight here as it's related but not the primary factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of 3. Small households can provide emotional support and stability, which are protective factors. However, combined with prior arrest, this might not be as strong. So, medium weight seems appropriate.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal matters. This indicates a lack of religious support or belief, which could affect her decision-making regarding substance use and other risky behaviors. I'll assign low weight here because while it's a factor, it doesn't directly correlate as strongly with recidivism compared to prior arrest or education.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction (high), no diploma (high), drug use (high) are the strongest risk factors pushing towards a YES outcome. The positive factors like living alone and small household (medium each) somewhat mitigate but aren't enough to offset the high risks. Therefore, I predict a YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine indicates potential substance abuse, which is linked to increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and recent distress may correlate with substance use but could also indicate underlying mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age in a small household provides some stability but does not fully mitigate risk factors like prior arrest.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God has no role suggests potential lack of religious support, which may influence behavior but is less directly linked to recidivism compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
