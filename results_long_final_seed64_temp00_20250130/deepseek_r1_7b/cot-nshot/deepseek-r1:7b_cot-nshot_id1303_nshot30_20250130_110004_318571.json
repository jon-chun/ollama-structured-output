    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this 18-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and behaviors. So that could be a low weight.\n\nHe has two prior arrests and convictions. More past offenses definitely increase the risk of rearrest. That's probably a high weight factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches, which isn't too tall, but his weight is between 200-224 lbs. That might not be directly related to recidivism unless it's linked to other factors like substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect recidivism; being in a stable environment reduces risk, so this is a medium factor because he's at higher risk but not the highest compared to others.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which has been shown to correlate with higher recidivism rates. That's a high weight.\n\nNot enrolled in college further indicates lower educational aspirations and possibly less support system, another high factor.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having job experience can help avoid getting into trouble again, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) is present but recent use isn't mentioned. Drug use itself is a risk factor because it can lead to substance abuse issues and other behaviors that might cause problems. So medium weight.\n\nHe's not felt depressed in the past month. Emotional well-being is important, so this positive factor would be low or maybe medium if there are underlying issues.\n\nAt young age, lived with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which could increase risk, but since he's living with his mother, it might indicate a stable environment. Maybe medium weight because the living situation is neutral unless there were other issues at home.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal issues. This could be a protective factor if religion provides support and guidance, so maybe low or medium depending on how strongly it influences his behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests (high), education (high), living situation (medium), job experience (low), drug use (medium). The positive aspect of living with his mother might slightly lower the risk. So overall, he's at a high risk but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which may indicate they are still developing their skills and behaviors, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"medium\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism based on provided information; weight is within a healthy range but not linked to substance use or health issues mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a stable support system increases risk, though the living environment seems neutral as he resides with his biological mother in an urban area.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled in college and held 3 jobs during the year; job experience can help avoid future issues, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) itself is a risk factor, but recent use isn't mentioned, so it's considered medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Well-being\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month; positive emotional state can indicate lower risk of substance abuse issues leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area; urban environments may have higher crime rates, but living with a parent suggests a stable environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
