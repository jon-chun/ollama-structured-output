    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll list out all the relevant information from the case.\n\nThe person is a 19-year-old female identified as American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Her height is 5 feet 5 inches and she weighs 140 lbs. She's married and living with her spouse, which might indicate stable living conditions. She lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which could be a significant risk factor. She held one job during the year but used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. She felt down for part of the past month, suggesting emotional distress. At age 19, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. She believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nNow, I'll compare this case to the provided examples (Examples 1-30) to determine how each risk factor contributes to recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: She's 19, which is relatively young and might have more time to change her situation.\n2. **Arrests**: Two arrests but no convictions\u2014this could indicate a lack of commitment or willingness to face the consequences of her actions.\n3. **Marital Status**: Living with her spouse suggests she has support, which might reduce recidivism risk.\n4. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED is a strong risk factor as it can lead to unstable employment and substance use.\n5. **Employment**: Held one job but used drugs\u2014this could mean she's struggling with substance abuse affecting both work performance and mental health.\n6. **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use\u2014substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, especially if it interferes with daily life or employment.\n7. **Emotional Distress**: Feeling down for part of the month could indicate underlying mental health issues that might contribute to substance use or other problems.\n8. **Household Size at Age 19**: Small household (3) might suggest she's living in a supportive environment, but it also depends on her family dynamics and support systems beyond that time.\n9. **Religious Belief**: She believes God is involved\u2014this could be a protective factor if it leads to personal accountability or seeking help.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on these factors:\n\n- **No diploma/GED (high)**: Lack of education significantly increases the risk of future criminal behavior and substance abuse.\n- **Drug use in past four years (high)**: Substance abuse is a known predictor of recidivism.\n- **Married living with spouse (low)**: Supportive living conditions can reduce recidivism, so this mitigates risk but isn't a strong protective factor.\n- **Employment during the year (medium)**: Having a job might help, but combined with drug use and other issues, it's not as strong of a positive indicator.\n- **Age at 19 (low)**: Young age is neutral; it doesn't inherently predict high recidivism without other factors.\n\nConsidering all these, her high risk factors are education level and drug use. The marriage might slightly reduce the risk but isn't enough to counterbalance the others. Therefore, she's likely to be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education significantly increases the risk of future criminal behavior and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, especially if it interferes with daily life or employment.\"),\n    (\"Married living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Stable living conditions from a supportive spouse can reduce recidivism risk but isn't a strong protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Employed one job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Having a job might help, but combined with drug use and other issues, it's not as strong of a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"Age at 19\", \"low\", \"Young age is neutral; it doesn't inherently predict high recidivism without other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
