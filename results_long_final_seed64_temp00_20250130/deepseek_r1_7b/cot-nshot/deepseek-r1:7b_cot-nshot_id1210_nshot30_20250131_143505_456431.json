    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 22 years old, with 5 prior arrests and convictions. That's a high number of offenses, which definitely increases the risk. So that's a high weight.\n\nHe's currently not living alone but with someone else, maybe his spouse or another relative. Not living alone could mean he has support, so maybe lower risk from isolation. But considering he's Black, there might be systemic issues affecting him, so I'll give medium weight here.\n\nHis education level is no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so that's a high factor.\n\nHe's never been married but is living with someone now. Marriage can provide stability, so maybe lower risk from this factor, but since he's Black, it might still have some impact, so medium weight.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year. Joblessness or underemployment is linked to higher recidivism because of unstable income and support systems. So high weight here.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a risk factor as it can lead to further issues like substance abuse problems, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society. High weight.\n\nHe feels down or depressed for much of the month. Emotional distress can impair judgment and increase recidivism chances. High weight here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living with multiple family members might indicate more support but could also mean neglect issues if not properly addressed. Since he's Black, this might have additional implications, so medium weight.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his personal issues is interesting. This could relate to his spiritual or mental health, which might influence his behavior. However, it's a bit unclear how this affects recidivism directly, but maybe it's positive if he's seeking help, so perhaps low weight here.\n\nPutting all these together: high, medium, high, high, high, high, high, medium, low. The factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. So I'll predict \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 5 arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may provide some support but could also indicate potential instability or neglect issues, especially considering systemic factors related to race.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college are strong indicators of lower educational stability and higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living with someone may provide some support, but the individual's history and circumstances could still pose challenges.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job during the year can lead to economic instability and increased vulnerability to criminal opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can contribute to substance abuse issues, which may affect mental health and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down or depressed for much of the month can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could indicate family support but may also suggest neglect issues, especially given systemic factors related to race.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has something to do with his personal issues might relate to seeking help or spiritual guidance, which could positively influence behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
