    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 20-year-old Black female based on her risk factors.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which is a moderate risk factor because even though she hasn't been convicted, it shows some involvement in the system.\n\nShe weighs 120 lbs and is 5'2\". Her weight might be a concern, but since she's 20, maybe she's at a healthy weight. Not sure if that directly affects recidivism, but perhaps her health could influence other factors like job stability or substance use.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, so that might be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; having a diploma might indicate better opportunities, but not being in school could mean she's seeking other avenues which might lead to more issues.\n\nShe held 2 jobs during the year. Having work experience can be positive as it shows stability, but if those were low-paying or unstable, that could be a risk. She has two jobs, so maybe some stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is good. That's a negative risk factor because substance abuse often leads to recidivism.\n\nShe felt down for part of the month; sometimes feeling low can lead to substance use or other issues, but she hasn't used drugs recently. So that might be a mitigating factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological dad in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and stress levels, which could contribute to negative emotions or substance use.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life, which is a positive factor as spirituality often correlates with better outcomes.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest (moderate), living alone (medium), diploma but not in college (maybe medium), two jobs (positive), no drug use (good), temporary low mood (maybe mitigating), urban living (could be negative or neutral depending on the area), and spiritual involvement (positive).\n\nPutting it all together, I think her risk is a bit higher than low. Maybe around 40% chance of rearrest. So my prediction would lean towards NO with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, which indicates some involvement in the system and could be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can correlate with higher risk behaviors or instability, making it a high-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment might indicate better opportunities but could also suggest seeking other avenues which may not be stable.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs during the year shows some stability, though the nature of these jobs could influence risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator and mitigates risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood\", \"low\", \"Feeling down for part of the month might be a minor issue but she hasn't used drugs recently, which suggests control over her emotions.\"),\n    (\"Residential History\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological dad in an urban area could have higher stress or crime-related factors that may influence her behavior.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"high\", \"Considering God has something to do with her personally is a positive factor and can correlate with better outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
