    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor for the given individual and assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to determine their impact on rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, the individual is a Black male, 21 years old, with two prior arrests but no convictions. His weight is 161 lbs, which isn't particularly low or high, so that might not be a significant factor here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which could indicate instability, possibly increasing his risk of recidivism. That's a medium-high risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nNot holding any jobs during the year suggests financial instability, which can contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors\u2014another high-risk factor.\n\nHis drug use history includes cocaine from the past four years, which is a strong indicator of potential continued substance abuse, increasing his risk. Additionally, he's felt down for some time, which might relate to mental health issues or stressors that could lead to further problems.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates and less stable living conditions\u2014another medium-high factor.\n\nLastly, he believes God has no role in his personal events, which might suggest a lack of religious support or guidance, potentially affecting his decision-making and relationships.\n\nConsidering all these factors, each contributes significantly to the likelihood of rearrest. The combination of prior arrests, lack of education, unemployment status, substance use, and unstable living conditions points towards a high probability of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior arrests but no convictions, indicating a history of criminal behavior which is strongly associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which are typically correlates with lower rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"unemployment_status\", \"medium-high\", \"He has held no jobs during the year, suggesting potential financial instability that could contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has a history of drug use (cocaine) in the past four years, which is strongly linked to substance abuse issues that can lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_state\", \"medium-high\", \"He feels down for some time during the month, indicating potential mental health issues or stressors that could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family Environment\", \"medium-high\", \"He lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area, which may be associated with less stable living conditions and higher crime rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
