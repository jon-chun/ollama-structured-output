    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. The person is a 19-year-old Black female with several risk factors. She has been arrested five times and convicted, which immediately raises concerns about recidivism. Her weight and height don't seem out of place for her age but are noted as between 125-149 lbs at 5 feet tall.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which can contribute to isolation and potential substance abuse issues. Having a high school diploma without college enrollment might indicate some educational barriers or maybe she's seeking further education now. Not holding any jobs during the year could mean she's facing unemployment or underemployed, both of which are linked to recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and isn't depressed, so that's a positive sign. However, her living situation is key here\u2014she's with her biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and poorer living conditions, which can increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nConsidering all these factors, each contributes to her likelihood of rearrest. The high number of prior convictions, lack of employment, and unstable living situation push her towards a high risk. Even though she's not using drugs and isn't depressed, other factors like age (19) might mean she's still developing, but the recidivism rate for this age group is generally higher.\n\nPutting it all together, each risk factor adds up to a strong case for predicting a YES outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 5 times and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, she is still developing, but recidivism rates for this age group are generally higher.\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"Her weight (125-149 lbs) and height (5 feet 0 inches) do not seem out of place for her age and do not indicate any health issues that could contribute to substance abuse or other risks.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"She is never married, which can sometimes be a sign of instability or higher risk behaviors if she were to remarry in the future.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases isolation and potential stressors that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, which might indicate barriers to further education or career opportunities that could contribute to recidivism if she were to drop out of school.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year could mean she's facing unemployment or underemployment, both of which are linked to higher rates of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"low\", \"She has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention efforts and lower risk of drug-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, which is another positive sign for her mental health and overall well-being.\"),\n    (\"living_with_biological_mother\", \"high\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area could indicate living conditions that are potentially unsafe or unstable, increasing the risk of environmental factors contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"god_consideration\", \"low\", \"She considers God to be involved in her personal matters, which might suggest she is more likely to seek help if needed rather than engage in risky behaviors without accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
