    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which might indicate some prior issues, so that could be a medium risk factor because it shows she has had trouble before, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's not as severe.\n\nShe weighs 134 lbs and is 5 feet 4 inches tall. Her weight isn't an issue here; it's more about her behavior and circumstances. So I can probably ignore this factor or consider it neutral.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, so that might be a medium risk factor because being single doesn't necessarily mean she's at high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; not having a higher education could increase the risk, so this should be a medium weight since she has some education but isn't continuing.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience can be positive as it shows she can manage her finances and support herself, so maybe this factor shouldn't heavily contribute to recidivism, perhaps low or neutral.\n\nShe uses marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to substance abuse issues, which might affect her ability to reintegrate into society. So this should be a high weight.\n\nSome of the time during the past month she felt down and couldn't cheer herself up. Emotional distress or low mood can contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors, so this is another high risk factor.\n\nAt 20 years old, she's relatively young, but her age alone doesn't determine recidivism risk unless there are other factors like prior offenses.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living with family can provide support and stability, which might actually reduce the risk, so this could be low or neutral.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal issues, which is a strong indicator of her spiritual support and might influence her behavior positively, so maybe this factor should have a lower weight.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: medium for prior arrest, medium for living alone, high for drug use, high for emotional distress, low for age-related stability, neutral for education, low for employment, and low for spiritual support. \n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors (drug use and emotional distress) seem to have a significant impact on her likelihood of recidivism. The prior arrest is also a medium factor but not as severe as the drug and emotional issues. So overall, I think she has a higher chance of being rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, indicating past behavior that may contribute to recidivism risk but hasn't been formally convicted.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate instability, which might be a minor contributing factor but not the most significant.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which could slightly increase risk due to potential financial or academic instability.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"She has held two jobs during the year, which suggests she can manage her finances and support herself, reducing risk factors related to employment issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana, is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to substance abuse issues that may affect reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress_and_mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and unable to cheer during the past month contributes to emotional distress, which can be linked to substance use or other risky behaviors, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size_and_stability\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three provides some support, reducing potential instability factors that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_support\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with her personally may provide a sense of stability and positivity, mitigating certain risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
