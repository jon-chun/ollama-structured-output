    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for a 19-year-old White female who has been convicted once, is currently not living alone, enrolled in a 2-year college, has used marijuana, feels down, and lived with both parents in a household of seven.\n\nFirst, her prior conviction: one arrest and conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. So that should be a high weight factor.\n\nShe's not living alone now but was with both parents at age 19. That might indicate she has support, which could lower the risk, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHer education level: no diploma or GED and enrolled in college. College enrollment can sometimes help as it shows commitment to improving herself, but without a degree, it's mixed. Maybe medium weight because while it's positive, not having a degree might still be a risk factor.\n\nEmployment: she held one job during the year. Job experience is generally protective against recidivism, so that could be low or medium depending on the nature of the job and stability.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase risk, especially if it's recent or frequent. So high weight here.\n\nFeeling down for a month: indicates emotional distress, which might correlate with substance abuse issues. High weight factor as it suggests potential underlying issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nHousehold size at age 19 was seven, which is large and could indicate she experienced family dysfunction, possibly leading to higher risk factors like drug use or emotional instability. High weight here.\n\nConsidering all these, the high weight factors are prior conviction, household size, drug use, and feelings of down mood. The medium might be education and living with parents. Employment status is low because one job isn't enough on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, her risk factors point towards a higher likelihood of recidivism. So I'd predict \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction for a crime, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as past criminal behavior is a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"current_living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"She is currently living with both biological parents in a household of seven, which may indicate potential family dysfunction or support issues that could correlate with substance abuse or emotional distress, though not directly indicative of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"She does not have a high school diploma or GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college.
