    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. He's been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a high number of arrests without a conviction, which might indicate past behavior issues or maybe inconsistent legal actions. I think this should be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. Weight isn't directly mentioned as a factor here, but being underweight sometimes can be associated with health issues that could affect recidivism rates. So, medium to low weight status might contribute to lower risk, but I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation alone doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe medium risk from this factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; not completing higher education might increase the risk of reoffending. This should be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe's held no jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of gainful employment can lead to substance abuse, poor decision-making, etc., which are linked to recidivism. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and not feeling depressed recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, can increase the likelihood of future substance abuse issues, which might contribute to reoffending. The lack of recent depression isn't directly related but could be part of other behavioral patterns. So medium risk here.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of two in an urban area at a young age. Living with a parent and in an urban setting can sometimes correlate with better opportunities or higher stress, but without more info on family dynamics or support systems, it's hard to say. Maybe low to medium risk from this factor.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal decisions. This could indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, which might affect his behavior and decision-making in the future. Medium risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: high (arrests), medium (weight status), medium (living alone), high (education), high (no job), medium (drug use), low/medium (family), medium (religion). The strongest factors are the arrests, lack of job, and drug use. These would likely increase the risk towards a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested five times without a conviction, indicating inconsistent legal behavior which could signal past issues or instability.\"),\n    (\"Weight Status\", \"low\", \"At 145 lbs at 5'9'', the weight status is underweight.
