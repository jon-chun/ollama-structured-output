    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll break down each risk factor from the provided examples and assign weights accordingly.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male who was arrested once but not convicted. He's 5'8\" and weighs 178 lbs. He's single living alone with a high school diploma, not enrolled in college. He held one job, used marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of four since childhood, and believes God influences his life.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- **Arrests**: Being arrested once but not convicted might be low risk if not convicted, as conviction is needed for recidivism.\n- **Age**: 21 is relatively young; younger individuals sometimes have more potential, so maybe medium risk.\n- **Weight and Height**: 5'8\"/178 lbs. Not sure how this affects, but in examples, height didn't seem to play a role much.\n- **Marital Status**: Living alone might indicate higher risk if he's not supported.\n- **Education**: High school diploma is good, so maybe low risk compared to less education.\n- **Employment**: Held one job; having some work experience could be positive but depends on the type of job.\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in past four years. Drug use can increase recidivism if it's recent or severe.\n- **Depression**: No recent feelings of depression, which is a good sign.\n- **Household Size**: Lived with household size 4 since childhood; maybe some instability but not extreme.\n- **God Influence**: Believes in God, which might reduce stressors.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n1. **Arrests (1)**: Low risk if not convicted.\n2. **Age (2)**: Medium, as younger individuals can be more at-risk.\n3. **Weight/Height (3)**: Low impact; no direct correlation in examples.\n4. **Marital Status (4)**: Medium, living alone might signal instability.\n5. **Education (5)**: High, diploma is positive.\n6. **Employment (6)**: Medium, held one job but not multiple.\n7. **Drug Use (7)**: Low to medium; recent use could be a risk factor.\n8. **Depression (8)**: High negative correlation with recidivism if no depression.\n9. **Household Size (9)**: Low impact in examples.\n10. **God Influence (10)**: High, positive influence reduces stressors.\n\nCombining these factors, the most significant are drug use and lack of depression. The person has a past arrest but not a conviction, which might lower recidivism risk compared to someone with a conviction. However, living alone and recent drug use could increase it slightly. Education is good, so maybe mitigates some risk.\n\nOverall, considering all factors, the prediction leans towards **NO** for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"Being arrested once but not convicted suggests low recidivism risk as conviction is needed for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old indicates moderate risk, as younger individuals can be more at-risk despite potential future stability.\"),\n    (\"Weight/Height\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism based on provided examples; height and weight not directly correlated in past cases.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate some instability, which could slightly increase risk but not significantly compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"High school diploma is a positive indicator of potential lower recidivism risk compared to those without education.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year; having employment can be beneficial but depends on the nature and stability of the job.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana in past four years, which could slightly increase risk if recent or severe use is present.
