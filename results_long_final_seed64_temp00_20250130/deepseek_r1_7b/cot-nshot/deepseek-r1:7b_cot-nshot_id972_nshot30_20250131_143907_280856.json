    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me start by carefully analyzing each risk factor mentioned in the case and compare them with the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, most individuals were either never arrested or had multiple arrests. Since she's only been arrested once, that might be a low to medium risk factor because being arrested even once can sometimes lead to more serious issues.\n\nShe weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, which is within a healthy range for her age. No information on weight as an issue here, so maybe no direct impact on recidivism from her weight.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. In the examples, most were also single or not married. Not being married might be associated with higher risk because of dependency issues, but since she's living alone, it might mitigate some factors. I'm leaning towards medium risk here.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism. In the examples, many had educational issues, so this would be a high risk factor because education plays a significant role in job opportunities and stability.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs during the year. Having some work experience might indicate better support system or higher self-esteem, which could lower her risk. So maybe medium to low risk here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, so that's a good sign as substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates. In examples, several had no drug use, leading to lower outcomes. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. So this is another low risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and poorer environments, which are associated with higher recidivism. Living with her mother might provide some stability, but being in an urban environment could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal decisions. This is significant because religious factors can influence behavior. If she doesn't see a divine role in her life, it might indicate lower self-control or higher risk of impulsive behavior, which would be a high risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: educational issues (high), living in an urban environment (medium), no drug use (low), no depression (low), and lack of religious involvement (high). The high factors are education and lack of religion. The medium is urban living. The low factors are job history, drug use, and mental health.\n\nI think the overall risk might be on the higher side because of her educational background and lack of religious support. However, since she's never been married and living alone, that might help reduce it a bit. But considering all factors, I would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest, which can sometimes lead to more serious issues, indicating moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is within a healthy range for her age, suggesting no direct impact on recidivism from her weight.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without being married may have dependency issues but could also provide some stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism as education plays a crucial role in job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs during the year may indicate better support systems and higher self-esteem, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator linked to lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, which can contribute positively to behavior.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing and Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area may provide some stability but could be associated with higher crime rates and poorer environments.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with her decisions might indicate lower self-control or higher risk of impulsive behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
