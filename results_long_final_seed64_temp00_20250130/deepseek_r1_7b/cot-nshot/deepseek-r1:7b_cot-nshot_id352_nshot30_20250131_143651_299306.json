    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 190 lbs. Weight isn't typically a major factor in recidivism unless it's extreme, but his BMI might be okay here. Not sure if this is low or medium.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014being single can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism because they might not have the same support structure as married individuals. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so that's probably high weight.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014employment is positive for reducing recidivism, so medium to high weight.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and no depression\u2014both are negative risk factors, so low weight.\n\nLived with adults other than biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. That's interesting because living with non-biological family might indicate different support systems or potential stressors, which could be medium weight.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life\u2014this is more about his personal beliefs and might not directly impact recidivism unless it affects his motivation or relationships, but I'm not sure. Maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high, education is high, job held is medium. The rest don't contribute much positively or negatively. So the overall risk seems moderately high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of prior convictions which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \" possessing a high school diploma and currently enrolled in college is associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job during the year can reduce recidivism risk, but it's not as strong as prior convictions or education.\"),\n    (\"other_residential_history\", \"low\", \"Living with non-biological parents may indicate different family dynamics that could be a minor factor in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_and_depression\", \"low\", \"No drug use and no depression are positive factors reducing recidivism risk, but they don't outweigh other negative factors here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
