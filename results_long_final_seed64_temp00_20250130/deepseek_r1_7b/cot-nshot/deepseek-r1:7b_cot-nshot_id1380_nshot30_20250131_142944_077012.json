    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young, but since he's already been convicted three times, that's a significant factor pointing towards recidivism.\n\nHe has a lot of arrest and conviction history\u2014three times arrested and convicted. That's high risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis weight is 135 lbs, which isn't extremely low or high, but combined with other factors like living alone might not directly impact his weight in this context.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is usually a protective factor, so not having one could increase his risk.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates, but it's also dependent on other factors like support systems.\n\nHe uses drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014which are strong indicators of substance abuse, which itself is linked to higher recidivism. Plus, he feels down a lot, which might indicate depression or other mental health issues that can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt 18 years old, living with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area\u2014though the size and environment could influence his stability and support, but since he's already been convicted multiple times, this might not be as significant on its own.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal issues. This lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with lower self-esteem or higher risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are high (three), no education, living alone, drug use, and a lack of religious involvement. All these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is quite young but has been convicted three times, indicating prior criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and convictions are significant indicators of past criminal history, increasing the likelihood of future rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED combined with not being enrolled in college can be a risk factor for recidivism as educational attainment is often linked to better opportunities and lower crime rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher risk without additional factors like substance abuse or lack of support networks, but it's not the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is strongly associated with substance abuse issues, which are known contributors to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down a lot can indicate potential mental health issues, which may contribute to criminal behavior or self-harm, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area does not inherently increase risk without other negative factors like substance abuse or lack of education.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with his personal issues may correlate with lower self-esteem and higher engagement in harmful behaviors, which can lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
