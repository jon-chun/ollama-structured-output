    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person in question is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which immediately raises concerns about past criminal behavior.\n\nHis height and weight don't directly indicate much, but his living situation is important\u2014he's never been married and is currently living alone. This could be a red flag for potential isolation or stressors in his life. His educational background shows he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which might suggest he's facing challenges in obtaining proper education, possibly contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, indicating limited work experience or income stability. This could affect his ability to support himself and might be a risk factor for reoffending. His drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine, which are strong indicators of substance abuse problems. Substance abuse often correlates with higher rates of criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\nThe most concerning part is that he feels extremely down every month, which could point to mental health issues or stressors in his life. This emotional state might lead him to engage in risky behaviors or reconsider his previous decisions, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four, suggesting a stable upbringing initially but now living alone adds instability. His belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues could indicate a lack of spirituality or support system, which might contribute to his current challenges and future behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past convictions, education, employment, substance use, emotional state, and family background\u2014I weigh each risk factor accordingly. The high number of past convictions and the presence of multiple risk factors like education, employment, and substance abuse push towards a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_convictions\", \"high\", \"Past convictions (2) significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED raises concerns about future employability and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employment history shows only 1 job in the past year, which may indicate instability or difficulty finding sustainable employment.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues that can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"high\", \"F frequent feelings of low mood suggest potential mental health issues or stressors that could lead to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents at age 19 suggests some initial stability, but now living alone may indicate a lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"religion Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God has nothing to do indicates potential lack of spirituality or support system which could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_living_alone\", \"high\", \"Age 19 and living alone can lead to isolation, stress, and increased vulnerability to negative influences or substance abuse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
