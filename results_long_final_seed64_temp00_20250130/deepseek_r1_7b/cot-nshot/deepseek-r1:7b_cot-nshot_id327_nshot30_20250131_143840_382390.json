    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old Black female described and determine their relative weights\u2014low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is quite young. Young individuals often have fewer life experiences and may not be as stable in their lives, so this could be a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. While being arrested is a negative point, not getting convicted might reduce the severity of her current situation compared to someone who has been convicted. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHer weight is 140 lbs at 5 feet tall\u2014this doesn't immediately raise red flags, so probably low or no direct impact on recidivism risk.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone. Living with both parents in a household of 10 suggests she has support from her family, which might indicate better stability, possibly reducing her risk\u2014so maybe low.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so this could be a medium to high risk factor depending on how much education she had before.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate some stability, which might mitigate her risk\u2014so perhaps low or medium.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana but no others mentioned. Drug use can have both immediate and long-term effects; since she only used marijuana, it might not be as significant unless there's a pattern of substance abuse.\n\nShe feels down often, indicating possible mental health issues. This could contribute to lower self-esteem and substance use, which are risk factors\u2014so this is probably high.\n\nHer living situation at age 18 with both parents in a large household suggests she has family support, which might help her stay out of trouble\u2014so low risk here.\n\nShe believes God plays a role in her life. This could be seen as positive if it's for support and guidance but might also indicate some level of instability or lack of control over her situation, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together: The high school diploma is a big negative (high), the mental health issues (high), and the arrest (medium). Everything else seems to mitigate these risks. So overall, she's at moderate risk\u2014maybe 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is quite young and may indicate less life experience and stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which might reduce the severity compared to someone with a conviction, slightly mitigating the risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college are significant factors linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"She has held 4 jobs during the year, indicating some stability and experience which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana is noted but no other substances mentioned.
