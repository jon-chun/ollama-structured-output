    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 21 years old, with 7 prior arrests and convictions. That's a high number of offenses, which definitely increases the risk. So that's a high weight.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 142 lbs. Weight isn't directly a factor here unless it relates to health issues, but since there's no mention of health problems, I'll consider this as low impact on recidivism.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014being single can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to lack of support, so that's medium weight.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment. Education level is a known predictor; not having further education might increase the risk compared to those with higher education, so medium weight.\n\nHe held 2 jobs during the year\u2014employment history can be positive, but if he lost jobs due to substance use or other issues, it's mixed. Since he has a history of drug use, maybe this is low weight because job loss could be related to substance abuse.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana) and no recent depression. Drug use itself is a risk factor, so that's high. Depression isn't mentioned, but if he's not depressed now, it might indicate better mental health, which is positive, but since the history shows no depression, maybe this is medium.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area\u2014household size can vary, but living with family might provide support. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, so that's low weight unless it's a high-crime area which isn't specified here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal issues\u2014this is a positive factor as religious beliefs can offer coping mechanisms and support, so medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together: High factors are prior arrests, drug use. Medium factors include being Black, single status, education level, job history, and belief in God's role. Low factors don't outweigh the high ones here. So overall, the risk is higher than not, but maybe leaning towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 7 prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"No significant health issues or weight-related problems are mentioned.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may increase risk compared to those with higher education levels.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year, but this could be mixed if related to substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression mentioned, which might indicate better mental health compared to those who are depressed now.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Lived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area, which may have varying implications depending on the crime rate of the area.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which can offer coping mechanisms and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
