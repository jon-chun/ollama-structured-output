    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 10 times and convicted\u2014 that's a high number of prior convictions. From the examples given, higher prior convictions usually lead to more likely rearrest. So I'd assign this a high weight because it's a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. Weight isn't directly mentioned in the examples, but his height is average for his age. No information on BMI or health issues, so maybe not as significant here. I'll give this a medium weight since it doesn't strongly indicate risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect recidivism, but without specific data in the examples, it's hard to say. Maybe medium weight because it's somewhat relevant but not definitive.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, so he's not completing education. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism rates. So this factor should have a high weight.\n\nNot enrolled in college despite not having a degree\u2014consistent with the previous point about education. This reinforces his lack of educational background, so another high weight.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year. Employment can help reduce recidivism, but if he's unemployed or underemployed, it might increase risk. Since he has no job now, this could be a red flag. High weight here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism. The examples show that drug use leads to YES outcomes more often than not. So high weight for both drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate he's mentally stable now. But past issues could still affect him. Medium weight because current mental state isn't as critical as past issues.\n\nYoung age at 18\u2014though in examples, some are younger but outcomes vary. However, being a minor can sometimes mean more intervention and less recidivism, but it also depends on other factors. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nLiving with a household of size 3 is small, which might provide stability. Smaller households often offer more support, so this could be a mitigating factor\u2014maybe low weight.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal issues. This indicates he's seeking religious guidance, which can sometimes help in reducing recidivism. So medium weight because it's positive but not directly tied to risk factors listed.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), no education (high), drug use (high), and living alone (medium). The other factors are either medium or low. High prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use push towards a high likelihood of rearrest. So I'd lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"High number of prior arrests (10) significantly increase the risk of recidivism as they indicate past criminal behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and skills.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is strongly associated with increased risk of criminal behavior and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Not being enrolled in college or having held only one job during the year may indicate unstable or insufficient financial situation, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher risk but is a mitigating factor compared to living with multiple family members as seen in some examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
