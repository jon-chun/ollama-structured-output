    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person is a 21-year-old Black male with several factors listed.\n\nFirst, his arrest history: he's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests are significant because they indicate past behavior that could be predictive of future criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it might not carry as much weight unless there's a pattern or other factors involved.\n\nNext, his weight and height: 6 feet 1 inch and 170 lbs. While physical characteristics can sometimes correlate with other factors like substance use, in this case, there's no mention of drug use, so maybe this isn't directly relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence stress levels and social support, which might affect recidivism, but since he's not in a relationship or with family mentioned, it's probably low to medium risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma: He has one, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to those without education. Not enrolled in college could mean he's seeking further education, which is positive.\n\nHe held one job during the year and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed recently. Employment can provide stability and reduce stress, so this is a mitigating factor.\n\nHousehold size at age: He lived with a household of 5 when young. Larger households might offer more support but could also mean less supervision if someone was in trouble. However, since he's now living alone, maybe the impact isn't as strong.\n\nBelief in God: He thinks God is involved in his personal events. This religious belief can provide emotional support and may influence behavior positively or negatively depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, similar cases with low recidivism had factors like education, stable employment, and living with family. Conversely, higher risk was associated with more negative factors like multiple arrests without convictions, substance use, etc.\n\nIn this case, most of his risk factors are positive or neutral. Only the arrest history is a bit concerning, but since he hasn't been convicted, it's not as impactful. The other factors like education, employment, and living situation all point towards lower recidivism.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I'd assign medium weight to each factor because while there are some negatives, they don't outweigh the positive influences significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a arrest history of 2 but no convictions.
