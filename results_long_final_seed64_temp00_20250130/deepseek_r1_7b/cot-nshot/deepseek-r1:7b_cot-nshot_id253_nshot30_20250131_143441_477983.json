    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male with 5 arrests but no convictions. That's a high number of arrests which usually indicates more serious or unresolved issues, so that should be a high weight factor contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, but since he's not mentioned as having any, I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nNever married and currently not living alone\u2014lack of stability can increase the risk of recidivism because unstable living conditions might lead to more substance use or other risky behaviors. So that's a medium weight factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a strong indicator; without it, he might face barriers to better opportunities and could turn to drugs or other negative activities. High weight here.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year\u2014lack of income can lead to dependency on substances or other issues, which increases recidivism risk. High weight factor.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana) but no mention of other substances like cocaine or heroin. Even so, drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Medium weight because it's just marijuana this time.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban household of five\u2014household size can affect living conditions and support systems, which might influence substance use or other issues. Medium weight as it's not the largest household but still could impact stability.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with his personal issues\u2014this indicates a lack of religious support, which some studies suggest might correlate with higher recidivism rates due to lack of guidance or support. High weight factor.\n\nPutting all these together: high, medium, high, high, medium, medium, high. The factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (5 but no convictions)\", \"high\", \"High number of arrests without convictions indicates unresolved or serious issues that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight (5'9\"/165 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No specific health issues mentioned, so lower risk factor related to physical health.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation (Never married, not living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stability from being single or living with others can increase risk of risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No high school diploma/GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"high\", \"Low educational attainment often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and support.\"),\n    (\"Employment (Held no jobs during the year)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment or lack of income can lead to substance use or other negative behaviors that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Used marijuana in past four years)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is a significant risk factor for recidivism despite not using other substances this time.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements (Biological mother in urban household of 5)\", \"medium\", \"Household size and living with family may influence support systems but doesn't directly correlate with higher risk without additional issues.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation (God has nothing to do with personal issues)\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious support or guidance can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
