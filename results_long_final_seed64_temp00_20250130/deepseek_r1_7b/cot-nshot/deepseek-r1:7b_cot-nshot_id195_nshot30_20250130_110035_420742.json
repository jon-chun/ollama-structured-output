    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted\u2014 that's a high number of prior convictions. From the examples given, people with multiple arrests tend to have higher recidivism rates because they've already had trouble before. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't directly mentioned as a factor here, but his height might be relevant if it affects his ability to live independently or find employment, but since we don't have that info, I'll stick with the given factors.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse\u2014 stability is usually good for recidivism. So this might actually lower the risk, maybe a low factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college\u2014 education level can influence job opportunities and self-esteem. Lower education might mean higher risk because he could have fewer options or feel trapped. So this could be medium to high.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014 having a job is positive as it shows some stability, but only one job isn't much. Maybe low impact on risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and no recent depression\u2014 drug use can have negative effects like decreased self-esteem or substance abuse issues, which might lead to more problems. But since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe that mitigates a bit. So this could be medium.\n\nHe lived with both parents at age young\u2014 living with supportive family is usually good for mental health and stability, so probably low risk factor here.\n\nConsidering all these: high prior convictions, lower education, one job, past drug use. The marriage might help offset some of the negative factors. But overall, his history suggests he's at higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant number of prior arrests and convictions (4), which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates as evidenced by the examples provided where multiple prior offenses correlated with rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"He has only a high school diploma, indicating limited post-secondary education, which can be a risk factor for finding stable employment or avoiding further involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"He held one job during the year, which may indicate some level of employability but also suggests limited opportunities for career growth or stability.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which can have negative psychological effects and potentially increase the risk of future issues.
