    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who is White, has been arrested once but not convicted, weighs 165 lbs, is 5 feet 6 inches tall, living alone, has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job during the year, used cocaine in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived with both her parents in an urban area at age young, and believes God influences her life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors from the examples provided. Each factor's impact on rearrest recidivism will be evaluated based on how strongly it contributes to criminal behavior or reoffending tendencies.\n\n1. **Age**: She is 19 years old. Younger individuals often have fewer life experiences and may not have established habits that could lead to recidivism. However, being under 20 can sometimes be a risk factor as they might still be developing. Weight: Medium.\n\n2. **Arrests**: She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily indicate a strong criminal history, but it's still a potential risk factor. Weight: Low.\n\n3. **Height and Weight**: 5 feet 6 inches and 165 lbs. These factors don't directly relate to recidivism unless there's an association with physical health or behavior, which isn't evident here. Weight: Low.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: She is living alone. Living alone can be isolating and might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Weight: Medium.\n\n5. **Education Level**: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education generally reduces recidivism, but being enrolled could mean she's seeking better opportunities, which isn't directly a risk factor. Weight: Low.\n\n6. **Employment**: She held one job during the year. Employment can provide stability and reduce stress, so holding a job might be protective rather than a risk factor. Weight: Low.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: She used cocaine in the past four years. Cocaine use is strongly linked to substance abuse issues, which can lead to legal problems or further criminal behavior. Weight: High.\n\n8. **Depression**: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent depression might indicate mental health stability, which could be protective rather than a risk factor. Weight: Low.\n\n9. **Household at Age Young**: She lived with both her parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in such conditions can sometimes lead to behavioral issues or substance abuse, especially in an urban setting where stress might be higher. Weight: Medium.\n\n10. **Belief in God**: She considers God influential on her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce stress but may also influence behavior if it leads to risky decisions. Weight: Low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the highest risk comes from drug use (cocaine), which is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues that could lead to further criminal behavior or difficulties in reintegration. The other factors either don't contribute significantly or might even be protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"She is 19 years old, which may still be a risk factor due to fewer life experiences and habits that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"Low\", \"A single arrest without a conviction does not necessarily indicate a strong criminal history but can still be a potential risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"Low\", \"These factors do not directly relate to recidivism unless there's an association with physical health or behavior, which isn't evident here.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone can be isolating and might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"Low\", \"Having a high school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college does not directly indicate a risk factor but may suggest seeking better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Holding one job during the year can provide stability, reducing stress and potentially being protective rather than a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"High\", \"Using cocaine in the past four years is strongly linked to substance abuse issues which can lead to legal problems or further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"Low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month might indicate mental health stability, which could be protective rather than a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Household at Age Young\", \"Medium\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area at a young age can sometimes lead to behavioral issues or substance abuse, especially in an urban setting where stress might be higher.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"Low\", \"Considering God influential on her life may provide support but could also influence behavior if it leads to risky decisions.\")\n  ],\n  \"rearrest_risk\": \"High\"\n}\n```",
