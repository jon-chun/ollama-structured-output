    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll list out all the relevant information from the case.\n\nThe person is a 19-year-old female Hispanic individual. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Her weight is 110 lbs, and she's currently living alone. She has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. She's held five jobs during the year. She uses marijuana and cocaine, which indicates substance abuse. Most of the time during the past month, she feels down, showing emotional distress.\n\nNow, I'll compare this case to the provided examples (Examples 1-30) to determine how each risk factor contributes to her likelihood of rearrest.\n\n1. **Age**: She's 19, which is relatively young. Younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates if they've already made efforts like getting a GED and working multiple jobs.\n2. **Arrests**: She has one arrest but no conviction. The number of prior arrests can be a significant factor; however, since she hasn't been convicted, it's less impactful than someone with a full record.\n3. **Gender and Ethnicity**: Hispanic females might have different recidivism rates compared to other groups, but without specific data, I'll consider her as an average Hispanic female.\n4. **Weight**: 110 lbs is below the typical adult weight range (around 150 lbs), which isn't directly a risk factor but could indicate health issues that might affect employment or substance use.\n5. **Marital Status**: Living alone suggests she's not in a supportive environment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\n6. **Education**: Having a GED is positive as it often correlates with better job opportunities and higher earnings, reducing the likelihood of future incarceration.\n7. **Employment**: She's held five jobs, which shows adaptability and resilience. Employment stability can help avoid recidivism by providing steady income and reducing stress.\n8. **Substance Use**: Regular use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which is linked to higher recidivism rates due to increased risk of accidents or legal issues.\n9. **Emotional Health**: She's been feeling down most of the time, which could be a sign of mental health issues that might contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral problems.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, individuals with multiple prior arrests, substance use, and living alone tend to have higher rearrest rates. However, having a GED and working multiple jobs can mitigate these risks. In this case, she has a GED and five jobs, which are positive factors that might lower her recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'll assign weights based on their impact:\n\n- **Employment**: High (multiple jobs indicate stability)\n- **Substance Use**: High (regular use is a strong indicator of potential issues)\n- **Emotional Health**: Medium (feeling down could relate to mental health but isn't as direct as substance abuse)\n- **Marital Status**: Medium (living alone might be a risk factor, but not as high as substance use or prior arrests)\n- **Prior Arrests**: Low (one arrest without conviction is less impactful than multiple)\n  \nOther factors like age and education are moderate. Combining these, the substance use and living situation seem to have the most significant impact. However, her positive factors like GED and employment might temper those risks.\n\nGiven that she has a high number of jobs but also struggles with substance use and emotional health, I'm leaning towards a medium confidence level for rearrest. She's at risk due to substance abuse and living alone, but her education and job stability could help reduce the chance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"She has held five jobs during the year, indicating adaptability and resilience which can contribute to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Regular use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant indicator of potential issues linked to substance abuse, increasing rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Health\", \"medium\", \"Most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up, which might relate to mental health issues affecting behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone suggests she is not in a supportive environment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which is less impactful than multiple prior arrests without convictions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
