    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll break down each risk factor from the provided examples and assign weights accordingly.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His height is 5 feet 9 inches, weight 165 lbs. He's never married and isn't living alone. He has a high school diploma without college enrollment. He held one job last year, hasn't used drugs in four years, feels no depression recently, lived with a household of four at age, and believes God affects his life.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 is similar to many cases. In some examples, younger individuals had lower recidivism rates, but it's not always consistent.\n2. **Arrests**: 1 arrest vs. others with more. More arrests can increase risk, so this might be a medium factor.\n3. **Height/Weight**: 5'9\"/165 is average; no direct link to recidivism in examples.\n4. **Marital Status**: Not married and not living alone. Marital status isn't always a strong indicator here.\n5. **Education**: High school diploma, which might be protective but varies by example.\n6. **Employment**: Held 1 job. Employment can reduce risk if stable, so maybe medium.\n7. **Drug Use**: No use in past four years; this is protective, perhaps low weight.\n8. **Depression**: No recent feelings of depression; positive factor, maybe high weight.\n9. **Household Size at Age**: Household size 4, which was common in examples but didn't always correlate with outcomes.\n10. **God's Influence**: Believes God affects life; some examples where belief influenced outcomes differently.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- **Arrests (Medium)**: One arrest without conviction might not be severe enough to significantly increase risk.\n- **Marital Status and Living Alone (Low)**: Not living with family or spouse could slightly increase risk but not heavily.\n- **Employment (Medium)**: Employed but only one job, which is better than unemployed but may not prevent rearrest.\n- **No Drug Use (High)**: No use reduces risk significantly.\n- **No Depression (High)**: Positive mental state is protective.\n- **Household Size (Low)**: Doesn't strongly influence outcomes in examples.\n\nConsidering these factors, the low weight might come from the arrest and living situation. High weights on no drug use and no depression would pull the prediction towards not rearresting. The employment status adds a medium factor but isn't as strong. Overall, despite some mitigating factors, there's still a risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest without a conviction, which may slightly increase the risk compared to having no arrests.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Not being married and not living with a spouse or family could slightly increase the risk of recidivism compared to those who are married or living with others.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year may provide some stability, but it is not as protective as having no arrests or drug use issues.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"high\", \"Not using drugs for four years significantly reduces the risk of rearrest compared to those who have used drugs in the past.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed for a month further reduces the risk of rearrest compared to those who have experienced depression recently.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
