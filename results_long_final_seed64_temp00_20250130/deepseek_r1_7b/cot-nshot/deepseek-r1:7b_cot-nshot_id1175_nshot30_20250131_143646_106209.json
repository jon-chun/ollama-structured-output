    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 11 times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases the chance of rearrest. Prior convictions are usually a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs between 175-199 lbs. His weight is within a healthy range for his height, so that doesn't seem like an issue related to substance use or other factors tied to recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married but isn't living alone either. That might indicate he has some support system, which could be positive, but it's not directly a risk factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, especially if completing education leads to better job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. One job might provide some income stability, which could help prevent further issues. However, it's not a lot of experience, so maybe that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can contribute to substance abuse problems, which often lead to more criminal behavior or other complications, increasing the risk.\n\nSome of the time during the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, both of which are known risk factors for recidivism.\n\nAt 18 years old, living with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more stressors, which might contribute to higher recidivism rates despite having a high school diploma.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal issues. This could be a positive sign as it shows he's seeking help, but it's also subjective and might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting this all together: The high number of prior convictions (11) is the most significant risk factor here. That alone would lean towards a high risk. Other factors like drug use, recent emotional distress, and living in an urban environment also contribute to higher chances. While he has a diploma and one job, these might not offset the other strong risk indicators.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think his likelihood of rearrest is quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 11 times and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which can contribute to substance abuse issues that may lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Some of the time during the past month he felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up, indicating potential mental health issues that could impact his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Urban Environment\", \"medium\", \"He is living with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area, which may be associated with higher crime rates and stressors commonly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college.
