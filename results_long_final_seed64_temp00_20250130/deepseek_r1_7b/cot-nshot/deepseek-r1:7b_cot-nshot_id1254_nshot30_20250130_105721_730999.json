    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll review the provided examples to understand how each risk factor contributes to the prediction.\n\nThe case in question is a 22-year-old Black male with several risk factors:\n- Arrested once but not convicted.\n- Weight of 185 lbs at 5 feet 9 inches.\n- Never married, living alone.\n- No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college.\n- No jobs held in the past year.\n- Drug use (marijuana and cocaine).\n- Felt down for some time during the past month.\n\nFrom the examples provided earlier, I notice that factors like prior arrests, education level, employment status, living situation, substance use, and family background are significant. Each of these was assigned a weight based on their impact in previous cases.\n\nStarting with prior arrests: He has one arrest but no conviction. In the examples, having an arrest without a conviction sometimes led to a 'YES' outcome, especially when other factors were present. So this factor might have a medium weight.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED is a strong risk factor because it limits opportunities and can lead to more unstable situations. This would likely be a high weight.\n\nEmployment status: Not holding any jobs in the past year suggests he's unemployed, which could indicate financial instability and higher risk of recidivism. High weight here as well.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone is often associated with higher risk compared to living with family or support networks. High weight.\n\nSubstance use: He uses marijuana and cocaine, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates due to potential legal issues and strained relationships. High weight.\n\nFeeling down for some time: This indicates possible stress or mental health issues, which can affect behavior and decision-making. Medium to high weight depending on the context.\n\nFamily background: He lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of 3. This suggests he didn't have a stable family environment, which is a significant risk factor. High weight.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, each contributes significantly to the likelihood of rearrest. The presence of multiple high-weight factors like education, employment, and family background would push the confidence towards 'YES'. \n\nLooking at similar cases, when there are multiple high-risk factors without any mitigating ones (like prior successes or strong support), the outcome tends to lean towards higher risk. In this case, with several high-weight factors present, it's reasonable to predict a 'YES' with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest without a conviction, which is a significant indicator of potential recidivism.
