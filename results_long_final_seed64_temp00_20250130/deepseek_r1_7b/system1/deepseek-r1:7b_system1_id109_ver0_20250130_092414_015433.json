    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being in his early twenties might be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals, but it's not always the case. However, race can play a significant role in recidivism statistics due to systemic issues.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is generally considered high risk because it indicates past involvement in the legal system, which could be a sign of problematic behavior or lack of effective support.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and he weighs between 150-174 lbs. This places him at a healthy weight for his height, so no issues there. No indication of drug use as he hasn't used drugs in the past four years. That's positive.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse, which suggests a stable living environment. Not having a high school diploma or GED could be a risk factor because educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when higher education is available as a safety net.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience might indicate stability and self-sufficiency, which are protective factors.\n\nHe felt down for much of the past month but hasn't used drugs. This could be related to mental health issues or personal problems, but without more context, it's hard to assess as a risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 8. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher stress levels and substance abuse, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief in God could be a protective factor if it leads to positive coping mechanisms or moral support, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like lack of faith or other negatives not mentioned here.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest and lack of education are strong indicators. The living situation with eight people might suggest potential stressors. However, the absence of drug use and stable family ties could mitigate some risk factors. Considering all these points, I would lean towards high risk but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
