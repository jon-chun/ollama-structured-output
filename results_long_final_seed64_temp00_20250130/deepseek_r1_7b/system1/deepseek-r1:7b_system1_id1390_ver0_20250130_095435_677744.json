    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered within the normal range and doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there are other factors. Being White might be a consideration if there are systemic issues or biases, but without more context, I can't assume that.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest increases the risk of reoffending, so multiple convictions definitely point towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 3 inches, which is quite tall, and his weight is between 200-224 lbs. That's on the higher end; maybe he's overweight or has a larger frame. Being overweight can be a risk factor for certain health issues that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't directly indicate high risk, but it could be a sign of instability if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree might suggest he's facing challenges at work or in his personal life, which could be contributing factors.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues, which are known risk factors for reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. These positive indicators suggest he's in a better mental state and isn't using substances, which are protective against recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Early exposure to a loving environment is generally positive, but living in an urban setting can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates or stressors.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which might affect his ability to get help if needed.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. His living situation and family background don't immediately raise concerns but also don't lower the risk significantly. The lack of education and employment are contributing factors that increase the chance of reoffending. The positive aspects like no drug use and mental health status help mitigate some risks.\n\nConsidering all these, I would rate this individual as high risk with a confidence level around 75%. There's a clear history of criminal behavior, which is a major red flag, but other factors also contribute to the overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
