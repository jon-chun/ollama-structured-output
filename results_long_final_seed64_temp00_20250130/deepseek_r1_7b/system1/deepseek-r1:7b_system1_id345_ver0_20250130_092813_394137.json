    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being White doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are systemic issues at play, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction can significantly increase the risk of reoffending, especially if it's for a serious offense. But since he only has one conviction, maybe it's not as severe as multiple offenses.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 128 lbs. These are standard measurements; nothing stands out here in terms of physical indicators of risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or other family-related issues, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when he's completed higher education. Not being enrolled might suggest some instability, but again, not directly high risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate adaptability and stability, which are positive signs for low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't a strong indicator unless it's more severe substances or if there's a history of substance abuse leading to other issues like depression.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign for low risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can have various effects\u2014some protective, others not depending on the context. Being in a rural area might mean less supervision or more exposure to risk factors like lack of community support.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes positively. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose but don't directly correlate with high risk unless there's evidence of belief leading to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together, the key factors that might indicate higher risk are prior arrest and convictions, living alone (though not necessarily high risk), and maybe the lack of college education if it's related to unstable situations. However, since he has four jobs and no recent depression, these positives might outweigh any negatives.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some factors that could be associated with higher risk, they don't strongly indicate it without more context or evidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
