    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered low risk compared to older adults who might have more life experience and potential health issues. Being White doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are specific stereotypes involved, but I think it's safer not to assume that here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests can be a red flag because they often lead to substance abuse, unstable living situations, or other negative behaviors. However, since he's now enrolled in college and is living alone, maybe he's working on improving his situation. The two prior convictions might indicate some past issues but don't necessarily mean high risk if he's making positive changes.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. That's a pretty hefty build, which could be associated with higher body mass index (BMI). A higher BMI is often linked to higher health risks like diabetes or heart disease, which can contribute to recidivism if not addressed properly.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which might increase the risk of substance abuse or other risky behaviors. However, it's also possible that he's single for legitimate reasons like being a student or having no ties in his area.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can be a positive factor as higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability, which can reduce the risk of engaging in risky behaviors. However, if he's not completing his education or getting support to do so, it might still pose some risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a steady job is generally beneficial for financial stability and reducing stress, but if he's unemployed or underemployed, that could be a risk factor. However, since he's attending college, maybe he's working part-time or looking for better opportunities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest no recent substance abuse and mental health issues, which can contribute to safer behavior patterns.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. This indicates he was raised in a non-traditional family environment, which might have different social influences compared to nuclear families. Urban living could expose him to various risks but also offer opportunities for learning and positive experiences.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious involvement might be associated with higher risk if it leads to a sense of isolation or lack of spiritual guidance, which can sometimes correlate with risky behaviors like drug use or seeking help for mental health issues.\n\nPutting all these together: He has some negative factors like past convictions and living alone but also positive ones like education, job experience, and no recent drug use. The presence of past criminal history might suggest he's had some issues that could impact his current behavior, but the lack of recent substance abuse and depression is a strong indicator against high risk.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think there's a moderate to low risk here. He has made efforts to improve his situation through education and attempting to find a job, which are positive signs. The past convictions might suggest some instability, but he's actively working on improving himself. Therefore, the confidence level should be relatively high that this is not a high-risk individual.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
