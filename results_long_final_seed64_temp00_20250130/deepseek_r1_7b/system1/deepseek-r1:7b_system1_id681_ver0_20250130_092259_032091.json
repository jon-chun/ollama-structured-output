    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age is typically not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean he's still developing his skills and behaviors. However, it doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there are other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which could be significant depending on the nature of the crime. If it's a serious offense like violent crime or drug offenses, that would increase risk. But since we don't know the specifics, I'll note this as a point to consider.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight between 225-249 lbs. That places him in the higher end of normal weight ranges for his height. While obesity can be a risk factor, especially if combined with other factors like drug use or living conditions, it's not immediately concerning on its own.\n\nHe is unmarried and currently not living alone. Living with others might suggest he has support, which could be protective rather than harmful. However, if there are issues in the household, that could be a concern, but we don't have information on that.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school can sometimes indicate lower educational attainment, which may correlate with higher recidivism rates. However, it's important to consider other factors like his current situation and support system.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness or limited employment is often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior, substance abuse, and other negative outcomes. This could be a significant red flag.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) suggests he's been involved with substances that can impair judgment and increase risky behaviors. Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can influence behavior, not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily mean he's free from mental health issues. It might be worth considering if there are underlying mental health concerns that aren't being reported.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of four at a young age in an urban area could indicate a stable or somewhat supportive environment, but urban environments can sometimes have higher rates of crime and substance abuse compared to rural areas.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, which might actually be protective rather than harmful.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest, drug use, limited employment, GED status, living with parents (though urban area), and no depression. These factors collectively suggest he is at moderate to high risk for future criminal behavior or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
