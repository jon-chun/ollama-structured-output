    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. That might not be directly related to risk but could influence other factors like cultural background or family dynamics.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a red flag because it shows criminal history which can impact his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 145 lbs, which doesn't seem out of the ordinary. No indication of physical issues here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating but without more info on social support or mental health, it's hard to assess directly.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor because not having income support might lead to dependency issues or increased risk of other crimes.\n\nIn the past four years, he used marijuana, which is a drug use but not necessarily high risk unless there's a history of more severe substance abuse. However, in the last month, he felt very down and couldn't find joy in anything. This suggests possible depression or low mood, which can be risky factors as it might affect his ability to function socially or handle stress.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area. That's a stable environment but considering he doesn't believe in God, maybe he has different life goals or values, which could impact his motivation and willingness to reintegrate into society.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (conviction), unemployment, possible depression from recent feelings of low mood, and living alone without strong support. These factors point towards a high risk. The confidence level is 75% because while some factors are moderate, the combination suggests he's at higher risk compared to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
