    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 19 might be considered at risk because it's early in life, but without more context on his behavior or circumstances, I can't say much yet.\n\nHe has been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. That could indicate past trouble, which is a red flag. Repeated arrests often mean he's had issues with the law before, which might suggest he needs help and isn't actively managing his behavior.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight 165 lbs. No direct info on BMI here, but maybe it's within a healthy range. Not sure if that affects risk assessment much.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living with others might suggest he has some support system, which could be positive or negative depending on the context. Maybe less risk than someone living alone?\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a significant factor. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations, unemployment, etc., all of which are risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment for that long could indicate economic instability, which might increase risk if he's struggling to find work or support himself.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) but no depression in the past month. Drug use can have both positive and negative impacts. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe he's managed it okay, but past use could still be a concern.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That's a family environment, which might influence his behavior or mental health. Urban areas can have different social dynamics compared to rural areas.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or spirituality, which some studies suggest might be associated with higher risk in certain contexts, but it's not always directly linked.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest instances without convictions, no education, unemployment, living with family in an urban area, and past drug use. These factors point towards a high-risk individual who may need intervention or support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
