    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age is usually low, but being Hispanic might not directly correlate with higher risk unless there's a specific statistic involved, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are typically indicators of past behavior issues, which can affect future reliability in treatment programs.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 260 lbs. While weight can be an indicator of substance use or health issues, without specific data on BMI or related health factors, it's hard to assess directly here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate risk but could be a protective factor depending on the support network available.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not continuing education might suggest he's seeking help but hasn't yet committed to it, or maybe he's facing academic challenges.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having a job can contribute to stability, so this might not be a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt down for some of the last month. Drug use is a clear indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to various behavioral problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This could indicate family environment factors that might influence his behavior or mental health.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might provide some stability but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are prior convictions (2) which is a strong indicator of past behavior issues, and drug use in the past four years along with feelings of low mood. These factors suggest he may be at higher risk for substance abuse and related issues, which can affect his ability to engage in treatment or maintain sobriety.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards high risk but not certain without more data. So, a prediction of YES with 75% confidence seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
