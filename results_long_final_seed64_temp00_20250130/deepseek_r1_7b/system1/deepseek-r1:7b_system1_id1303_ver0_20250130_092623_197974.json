    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male of Black descent. While race can be a factor in some risk assessments, it's not typically the most significant on its own unless there are systemic issues involved. So maybe that's a moderate point.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions, especially at such a young age, could indicate prior criminal behavior which might suggest higher recidivism risk. That's probably a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and he weighs between 200-224 lbs. This places him in the overweight or obese category. Being overweight can be a risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, which could affect his overall well-being and perhaps his ability to engage in certain jobs.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like lack of support network or unstable living conditions. Without more context on his living situation, this might be a neutral factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can affect future earnings and job opportunities, which could influence his ability to reintegrate into society successfully. Not having a diploma might suggest he's facing barriers that could contribute to risk.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs is generally positive as it shows stability and the ability to support himself financially. However, if one of those jobs was in a high-risk field or if he frequently changed jobs without securing stable income, that could be concerning. But with three jobs, this seems okay.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both positive and negative impacts.Marijuana is generally less harmful than other drugs but can still affect behavior. Not feeling depressed might suggest he's managing his substance use well or perhaps it doesn't heavily influence his mental health in this context.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. This could indicate family stability if the environment was positive, but urban areas can have higher stress levels and potential issues like homelessness or poverty which might affect him negatively. The size of the household is also a factor; larger families sometimes have different dynamics.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which generally reduces risk factors. However, if there are underlying issues related to religion (e.g., discrimination or family dysfunction), that could change things. But as stated, he considers God something positive for him.\n\nPutting it all together: The key red flags here are the two prior convictions, being in a vulnerable demographic (younger age with multiple arrests), and his educational background without a diploma. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior. The other factors like living alone don't necessarily add to the risk unless there's more context on living conditions.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would lean towards high risk but not certain. Maybe an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
