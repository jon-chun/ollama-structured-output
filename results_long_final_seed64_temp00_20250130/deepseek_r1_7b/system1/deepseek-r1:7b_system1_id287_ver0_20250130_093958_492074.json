    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment; younger individuals might be more prone to change or have fewer life experiences that could correlate with higher risk behaviors. However, without specific data on his behavior, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction can indicate past criminal behavior, which might suggest he could engage in similar behavior again. But the number of convictions is a key factor; one might not be enough on its own but still points towards risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. This falls within a normal BMI range for his age, so no indication of substance abuse from weight or appearance here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently can be associated with lower risk behaviors compared to those in relationships, but it also depends on personal circumstances and support systems.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment is generally linked to lower recidivism rates because education can provide opportunities and reduce future criminal tendencies. However, this alone doesn't negate risk; some individuals with higher education might still engage in risky behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities can help manage financial stability and reduce stress, which are positive factors for reducing risk.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to substance abuse disorders, which increase recidivism rates. However, since he hasn't felt depressed lately, this might suggest he's managed his use or doesn't associate drug use with negative emotions.\n\nHe lived at a young age with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a large household can sometimes lead to different social dynamics and stressors, but it also depends on the environment and support available to him now.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; some might make decisions based on faith rather than external factors, which could be either protective or risk-related depending on context.\n\nPutting all this together: The prior arrest and conviction are concerning but not definitive indicators of high risk without more data. His drug use is a red flag, especially if it's frequent despite recent lack of depression. However, his education, living alone, and manageable job history might mitigate some risks. The household environment could be a point for concern or not, depending on how supportive he is now.\n\nConsidering all factors moderately, I would lean towards a high risk but with lower confidence than someone with more concerning indicators like multiple prior convictions or substance abuse with negative consequences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
