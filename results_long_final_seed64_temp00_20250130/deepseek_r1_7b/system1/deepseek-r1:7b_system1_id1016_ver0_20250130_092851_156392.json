    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the given individual. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of Black descent. Racial factors can play a role in recidivism rates, but without more context, it's hard to say if this alone is high risk.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but not convicted. Re-arrests are often linked to higher chances of reoffending, so that's a positive sign.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes.\n\nLiving alone might indicate she's less likely to get support from family or community, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers can sometimes lead to unstable situations, so that's another risk point.\n\nHaving held only one job during the year suggests she might not have steady income, which can contribute to poverty-related issues linked to higher recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a good sign; substance abuse is a major factor in criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Emotional well-being is important for avoiding self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nLiving with six people at a young age could mean she's part of a larger household, which might have different dynamics affecting her mental health and stability.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of religious support, which can be protective against certain risk factors.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some negative indicators like past arrests and educational issues, the lack of convictions, no drug use, and positive religious involvement balance things out. The re-arrest history is a concern but not definitive high risk without more data on her current situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
