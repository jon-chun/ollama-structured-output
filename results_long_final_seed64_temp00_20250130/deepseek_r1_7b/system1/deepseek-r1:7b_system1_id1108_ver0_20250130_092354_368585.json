    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered within normal risk factors unless there are other red flags. Being Black doesn't inherently make someone a risk, but it might be relevant if we're considering systemic issues or other biases, which I don't have information on here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a prior conviction. That's significant because recidivism is a major factor in risk assessment. Three arrests are already concerning, especially with a prior conviction. This could indicate past behavior that might lead to future criminal activity.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 235 lbs. While weight can be an indicator of substance use or other health issues, there's no direct information here about drug use. However, since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, that might mitigate some risk factors related to substance abuse.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there are other factors like lack of support network or unstable living conditions, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be linked to lower recidivism rates when completed, but not having it might suggest he's facing barriers to better opportunities or support systems. However, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like unstable employment.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having a job is generally positive as it can provide stability and reduce criminal tendencies. Two jobs are manageable and don't usually predict high risk on their own.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is a good sign. Drug abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so not using drugs could lower the risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can be a contributing factor to substance abuse or other risky behaviors, but since he's not experiencing it now, that might indicate better mental health and lower risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of ten in an urban area. That's concerning because living in a large family in an urban setting can lead to various issues like exposure to crime, substance abuse, or neglect. Urban environments often have higher rates of such problems compared to rural areas.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This could relate to his spiritual support and how it affects his behavior. If he's finding meaning through religion, it might help in avoiding negative behaviors, but this is speculative without more context.\n\nPutting all these together: three prior arrests, living alone or in a large household, lack of education, unemployment issues, and no recent drug use are all factors that could increase risk. The urban environment where he lived as a child adds to the concern about exposure to potential negative influences.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards high risk but not certain. His prior criminal history is a strong indicator, even if some factors like lack of education or living situation might be mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
