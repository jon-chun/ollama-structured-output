    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is usually not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean she's still developing her life skills and hasn't faced significant challenges yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That means she's in a position where she's had some contact with the legal system but hasn't reached a conclusion that affects her record more permanently. Maybe this could indicate some underlying issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe it's less concerning.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 165 lbs. No info on BMI or if she's underweight or overweight, which might be relevant for certain risk factors like physical health.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk in some contexts, but without knowing her circumstances, it's hard to say. Maybe she has support from family or friends.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk because having more education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job might be enough for some, but if it's unstable or she's not making much money, that could be a red flag. However, just holding a job doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nDrug use: She used cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have serious consequences, especially if it's leading to other issues like depression or substance abuse problems. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed might suggest she's managing her use well, but it's still a risk factor.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone and having no significant relationships. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to mental health issues. If she's not feeling depressed now, maybe she's coping, but it's something to consider.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Being in a larger family could provide more support and stability, which is usually protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without knowing if that belief leads to problematic actions, it's hard to assess as a risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: She has one arrest, no conviction, which might indicate some underlying issues but not necessarily high risk. Her living situation is stable in terms of family support. Education and employment are positive indicators. The drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent or if she's using it regularly despite not feeling depressed now.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some red flags like drug use, the other factors seem mitigating. Maybe around 30% confidence that this indicates high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
