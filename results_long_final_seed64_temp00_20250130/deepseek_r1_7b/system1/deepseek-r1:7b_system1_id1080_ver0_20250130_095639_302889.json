    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger in certain contexts, but at 21, that's still early adulthood. Being Black might be a consideration if there are demographic factors involved, but I don't have specific data on how race affects risk assessment here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant red flags because they indicate past behavior that may pose risks to others or the community. Each prior offense can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 4 inches, which isn't unusual for a young adult male, so no immediate risk there. Weighting him at 210 lbs doesn't raise any red flags unless it's significantly above average, but without context on BMI or other factors, I can't say much here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone isn't inherently risky, though it might be a sign of instability if there are underlying issues. His marital status alone doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates, but not all educated individuals are low risk. However, being currently enrolled suggests he's proactive about his education, which might be positive.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having a job, especially full-time or part-time, is generally associated with stability and lower risk compared to those who are unemployed or have had multiple jobs. But having just one job doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a factor, but since he's not experiencing depression now, it might suggest he's managing his substance use without severe mental health issues. However, past drug use could still be a concern if there are other factors like street use or frequency.\n\nHe lived at a young age with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Living in a large household can sometimes indicate family dysfunction or stressors that might affect his behavior later on. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which could be a contributing factor.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might influence his decision-making regarding risk management but doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are other factors suggesting otherwise.\n\nPutting it all together: Two prior convictions increase the risk. His living situation and family background could be contributing factors, but without more information on those areas (like whether the household was stable or if he experienced abuse), I can't fully assess that. His education level is positive, but his job status isn't a strong indicator of risk.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are some mitigating factors like education and current employment, the two prior convictions do suggest a moderate to high risk compared to the general population.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
