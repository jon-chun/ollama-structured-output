    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male of African American descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism studies, it's important to consider other variables too. He has only been arrested once but not convicted, which is a positive sign as first-time offenders often have better outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here unless there's an issue with his health that could affect his ability to perform well in school or work, but nothing suggests he's underweight or otherwise unhealthy.\n\nHe's living alone, which might indicate some level of independence. Not being married is neutral; it doesn't inherently pose a risk without more context on his living situation or circumstances.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school and has only held one job during the year. This suggests he's actively engaged and possibly seeking better opportunities, which are positive indicators for low risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is excellent. The mention that some of the time he felt down but nothing could cheer him up might indicate a possible substance abuse issue or emotional distress, but since he doesn't use drugs, it's less concerning.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area suggests he has family support and is part of a stable environment. This can provide emotional stability which is protective against risk.\n\nConsidering that he believes God plays a role in his life adds a positive moral compass, which generally correlates with lower risk behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors lean towards low to moderate risk. There's no clear indication of substance abuse beyond drugs, and he has a stable family background. His active engagement in school and job suggests good self-direction. The emotional distress is noted but not tied to drug use, so it might be more related to personal issues or stressors that aren't directly linked to the factors provided.\n\nTherefore, I would assess this individual as having low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
