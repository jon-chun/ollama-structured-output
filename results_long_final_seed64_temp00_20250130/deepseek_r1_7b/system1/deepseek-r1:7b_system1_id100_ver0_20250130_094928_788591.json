    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male from American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. Age-wise, being 19 isn't too old, but considering he's been arrested nine times and has a criminal record, that's a significant concern. Repeated arrests often indicate unstable behavior or lack of responsibility.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 180 lbs. While his height and weight aren't extreme, combined with a criminal history, this could suggest potential substance abuse issues, which is another red flag.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking help when needed.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree could mean he doesn't have the skills necessary for stable employment or effective relationships.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which again ties into education gaps affecting his ability to provide for himself or contribute positively in society.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's ongoing, it might not directly correlate with current behavior unless there's a relapse indicator like depression symptoms.\n\nHe lived in a household of eight at a young age. That's a large family, which could indicate growing up in an environment with potential neglect or abuse, both of which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has religious support, which can be protective against certain types of recidivism, especially violent crimes, but doesn't directly relate to general risk unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest records, lack of education, living situation, and potential substance use issues. These factors collectively point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
