    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of African American descent. Minorities often have different risk profiles compared to non-minorities, so that might be a red flag.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest can sometimes indicate prior issues or maybe she's actively trying to avoid trouble now.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here unless there's an issue with her health related to these stats, which isn't indicated.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone is a common risk factor for substance abuse because isolation can lead to emotional distress without support.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not continuing education might mean she lacks the skills needed for better opportunities or could be disengaged from her current life.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year, which suggests some financial stability and responsibility, which are positive indicators.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can have serious mental health implications and is a strong risk factor for various issues like addiction, depression, or violence.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood might indicate depression or anxiety, both of which are significant risk factors for other crimes or substance abuse.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Small households can sometimes lead to higher stress due to limited support and resources, especially if she's feeling neglected.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a positive factor as spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest, drug use, recent low mood, and living situation might indicate moderate risk. However, considering the factors, I'm leaning towards high risk but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
