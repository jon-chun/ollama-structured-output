    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties might not be a strong indicator on its own, but it's important to consider other factors together.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which typically indicates higher risk of reoffending. Each arrest can increase the chances of getting involved with the criminal system again.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, and he weighs between 175 to 199 lbs. While weight isn't directly predictive of risk, combined with other factors like substance use, it might be relevant in a broader assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to stay out of trouble or seek help when needed.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree could mean he's facing challenges that contribute to unstable behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which can lead to financial instability and increased vulnerability to exploitation or criminal activity.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent use in the past month leading him to feel down. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for both substance-related crimes and general criminal behavior.\n\nHe feels that nothing can cheer him up when he's down, which might indicate feelings of hopelessness or low self-esteem. These mental health issues can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. This could suggest family dysfunction or potential exposure to adverse childhood experiences, which are associated with higher risk of criminal behavior and other negative outcomes.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his personal events. While this might indicate religious involvement, it's important to consider how that belief system affects his behavior and support network.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, lack of education, unstable living situation, no job, feelings of hopelessness, and family background\u2014all point towards a high risk profile. The combination suggests he is likely to engage in criminal activity again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
