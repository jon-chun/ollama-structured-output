    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 might be considered a minor, but since he's already been arrested three times and convicted, that's more concerning. Race can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments, but I'm not sure if being White increases risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest could indicate past behavior issues which might predict future criminal activity or substance abuse problems.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height are typically considered in risk assessments unless there's evidence of related issues, but here it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a red flag because it might indicate instability or lack of support, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, so he's actively engaged in education. That's positive behavior that might reduce future risks related to substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially without concurrent depression, might indicate ongoing substance abuse issues which are high risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five people. A larger household at a young age could suggest living with extended family or friends, which might not directly correlate to risk unless there's evidence of family dysfunction.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief can sometimes be protective against certain types of behavior, but it doesn't necessarily lower the risk if other factors are present.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior arrests (3+), drug use history, living alone, unemployment, and being 18 years old. These factors point towards a high risk profile. The presence of substance abuse issues without addressing them could lead to further problems. His age might mean he's still developing coping skills, which can be risky.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because the number of prior convictions alone is a strong indicator. However, I should consider that some factors like being in school and not working might mitigate risk if addressed properly. But given the other points, it's probably still high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
