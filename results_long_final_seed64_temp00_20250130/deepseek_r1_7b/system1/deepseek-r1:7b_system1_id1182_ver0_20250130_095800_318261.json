    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered within the normal range and doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there are other factors. Being Black isn't inherently a risk factor but could be associated with certain systemic issues that might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe's been arrested seven times and has a conviction history. That's significant because multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, can indicate past problematic behavior or substance abuse. Each arrest is a potential indicator of criminal tendencies or unstable situations.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 142 lbs. While weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's significantly above average for his height, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So maybe this isn't a strong indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or substance abuse because there's less supervision and support. However, without more context on his living situation or any related issues, it's hard to quantify this risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not continuing education might indicate some level of disengagement from formal education, which could be linked to risky behaviors if he's not seeking better opportunities or support.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities can sometimes correlate with higher stability and self-sufficiency, so maybe this isn't a strong risk factor. However, it depends on whether he was consistently employed or if there were issues with his work history.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (specifically marijuana) but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without recent mental health issues might not directly indicate high risk unless there's a pattern of substance abuse that could lead to more serious problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a large household can sometimes be associated with higher stress or instability, which might contribute to risky behaviors if the individual isn't getting adequate support or is exposed to negative influences.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This could indicate a strong moral compass or belief system, which might mitigate some risk factors by providing guidance and structure. However, it's also possible that this belief could lead to self-handicapping if he feels the need to engage in risky behaviors to achieve spiritual fulfillment.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions (7 times), living alone, past drug use, and a young age of entry into substance abuse could be strong indicators of high risk. The other factors like being Black, not having a college degree, and living with his biological mother don't seem as directly linked to high risk unless they are part of a larger context that's not provided here.\n\nConsidering the number of arrest convictions (7), which is quite high, along with potential substance abuse issues and living in an unstable household, I would lean towards a high risk. The other factors might contribute but aren't as significant as these points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
