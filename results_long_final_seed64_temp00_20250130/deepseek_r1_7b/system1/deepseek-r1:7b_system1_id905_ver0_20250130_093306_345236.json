    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 22 isn't necessarily a red flag unless there's something else indicating he's in trouble. Being Black could be a factor depending on the dataset or prior knowledge about crime rates among different ethnic groups, but I don't have specific data here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. So two arrests mean he's had some contact with the system, maybe for minor offenses. Not being convicted might suggest that his past behavior wasn't severe enough to result in convictions, which could be a positive sign.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight between 175-199 lbs. That seems within a normal range; no indication of being overweight or underweight, so probably not related to substance abuse or other health issues linked to risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of higher risk because it might mean he doesn't have support from family or friends, which could affect his ability to get help if needed. But without more context on his living situation stability, it's hard to say how significant this factor is.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can correlate with recidivism rates; generally, higher education might reduce the risk of reoffending. Not being enrolled could mean he's either looking for more education or maybe not motivated to stay on track.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests some stability and ability to support himself financially. More employment opportunities usually correlate with lower risk behavior.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression over the past month. These are positive indicators as they show he hasn't been struggling with substance abuse or mental health issues, which can be significant contributors to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. That's a large family size, which might indicate living conditions that could stress him out or affect his development. However, without knowing the specifics of those living conditions, it's hard to assess how much this contributes to risk.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This is a strong indicator of good moral values and likely low risk behavior compared to someone who doesn't have such beliefs or guidance.\n\nPutting all these together: two arrests, no convictions, normal weight/height, living alone but not necessarily unstable, high school diploma, three jobs, no drug use, no depression, and positive religious belief. These factors lean towards lower risk because he hasn't had significant criminal history beyond minor offenses, isn't in a vulnerable situation like a large household without support, and has positive personal values.\n\nHowever, the two arrests do suggest some past involvement with the system, which could be a mitigating factor but not necessarily high risk on its own. The living alone might indicate he's somewhat stable, so maybe it's a low to medium risk. But considering all factors, I think his risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
