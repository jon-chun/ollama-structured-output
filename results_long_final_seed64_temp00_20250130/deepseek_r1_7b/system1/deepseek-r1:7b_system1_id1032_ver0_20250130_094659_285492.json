    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 22 years old. Young age can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because of inexperience, but it's not always a guarantee.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race. I don't think race is a significant factor in most risk assessments unless there's specific systemic issues involved, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. A single arrest might indicate some past behavior that could be problematic, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'6\" and 124 lbs. BMI calculations can sometimes suggest underweight or overweight, which might relate to health issues affecting her ability to work or care for herself, but I'm not sure how significant that is in risk assessment without more context.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability from a relationship could be protective rather than harmful, so maybe this isn't a high risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations, joblessness, which might increase risk of further issues.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential for involvement in criminal activities again.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but felt down recently. While drug use isn't mentioned, feelings of low mood could be related to other stressors or mental health issues.\n\nYoung household size of 4: Maybe she's part of a family that's experiencing some strain, which could affect her stability and decision-making.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which might influence her personal relationships or coping mechanisms with stress.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are several factors pointing towards potential risk\u2014like lack of education, unemployment, young age\u2014the absence of a conviction and marriage living with spouse somewhat mitigates some risks. However, the combination still suggests she could be at moderate to high risk for reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
