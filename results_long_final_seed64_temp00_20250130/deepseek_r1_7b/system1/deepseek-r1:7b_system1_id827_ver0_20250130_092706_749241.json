    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 might be considered at risk because it's early in life, but without more context on his behavior or circumstances, I can't say much yet.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest increases the chances of future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 160 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some cases, without knowing his body fat percentage or other health factors, it's hard to assess if this is relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might suggest social support, which could mitigate risk, but it also depends on the nature of the relationships. Without more info, I can't be sure how this affects his risk level.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree might increase his risk as he may face employment challenges or lack life skills necessary for success.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues, which are often associated with higher risk of reoffending. However, it's important to consider if this is due to systemic factors like lack of opportunities.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both immediate and long-term effects on behavior and mental health. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed might suggest some control, but drug use itself is a risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone at a young age in a household of three with his religion playing a role. While religion can provide support, living alone without family or friends could increase feelings of isolation and depression, which are linked to higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, and living in an environment that might not provide enough support (living alone) all point towards high risk. The use of drugs doesn't directly correlate with high risk but can contribute indirectly through other factors like addiction leading to further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
