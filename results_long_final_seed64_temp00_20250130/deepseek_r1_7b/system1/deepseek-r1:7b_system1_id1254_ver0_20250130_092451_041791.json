    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in some areas, but that varies widely depending on the context and systemic issues. I'm not sure if that alone is enough to indicate high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a mitigating factor because being arrested doesn't necessarily mean he's guilty. However, it does show some involvement with the legal system, which might suggest potential for future behavior.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 9 inches and 185 lbs. I don't see an immediate risk associated with his physical characteristics unless there's a history of health issues or substance abuse, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be risky because he might lack support networks, which could contribute to isolation and potential substance abuse.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not completing education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. He might not have the skills needed for stable employment or effective decision-making.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances, lack of financial stability, and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a history of drug use: marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with some recent use in the past month. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential for substance-induced delinquency or behavior problems.\n\nHe feels very down in the dumps during the past month, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues. These can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in an environment without strong family support can lead to higher rates of criminal behavior, substance abuse, and other risks.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God or any higher power affecting his personal life. This lack of religious support might contribute to a sense of helplessness or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting all these factors together: one arrest, no conviction, living alone, no job, drug use, recent feelings of low mood, and a background without strong family support. These are all significant red flags that suggest high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
