    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is usually not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean she's still developing her life skills and hasn't faced significant challenges yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That means she has at least one criminal history, which can be concerning because even non-convicted arrests can affect future opportunities. However, since it's just one arrest, the impact might be limited unless there are other factors.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight 135 lbs. No direct info on BMI here, but that's not typically a risk factor in itself unless combined with other metrics.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or isolation, which might be linked to substance use or other issues she has.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk of certain negative outcomes because education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on social services, which might increase risk factors like substance abuse or lack of support networks.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk if she's not experiencing severe mental health issues right now. However, ongoing substance use can be a red flag for future problems.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite drug use. That might suggest she's using drugs to cope with stress or other pressures rather than seeking professional help, which could be concerning.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. This could indicate a stable home environment initially but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are issues like abuse or neglect noted elsewhere.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. This is more of a personal belief and might not directly impact risk assessment, though it's worth noting if she appears to be religiously devout as that could influence her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: One non-convicted arrest, living alone, no job, drug use without recent depression. These factors could indicate moderate risk but not necessarily high. The confidence level should reflect a reasonable but not extremely high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
