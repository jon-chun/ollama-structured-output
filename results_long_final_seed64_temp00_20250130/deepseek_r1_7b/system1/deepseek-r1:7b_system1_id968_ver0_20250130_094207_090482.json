    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger than typical offenders, but at 21, that's pretty early in life. Being White doesn't inherently make someone more or less risky on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That might be a positive factor because being acquitted could mean he's not facing the consequences of his crimes yet. However, it also depends on what those charges were and how they affected his life.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 140 lbs. No immediate risk factors here unless there's something about his body type that suggests otherwise, but nothing jumps out at me.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, which might increase risk in certain situations, but it also depends on other factors like financial independence.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because more education often leads to better job opportunities and self-sufficiency.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability, but if he's unemployed or underemployed, that could be a risk factor. However, holding any job is generally positive compared to not having one at all.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) might suggest some substance abuse issues. Substance abuse can definitely increase risk of further criminal behavior or health issues affecting his ability to function.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression isn't directly tied to recidivism, chronic depression is a serious mental health issue that could impact someone's ability to commit crimes or adapt socially.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household can sometimes provide more stability and support, but it also depends on the dynamics within the family and the broader environment.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be a sign of religious dis belief or lack of spirituality, which might affect his motivation for criminal behavior differently than someone who sees religion as a guiding force.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some risk factors like past drug use and living in an unstable household, the key mitigating factors include being White (though not directly), having a high school diploma, being enrolled in college, only one job, and no prior convictions. The lack of marriage and living alone might be more about personal circumstances than risk.\n\nI think overall, while there are some indicators that could point towards moderate risk, the presence of education, stable living situation (though he's single), and limited substance abuse suggest that this individual is not a high risk. Therefore, I would lean towards \"NO\" with lower confidence because even though there are some risk factors, they don't outweigh the mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
