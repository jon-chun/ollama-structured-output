    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a marker of vulnerability, especially in certain areas where higher arrest rates are common among youth. Being White might have some societal connotations related to crime statistics, but I need more context on that.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Each prior offense can signal a pattern of misconduct.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and he weighs 230 lbs. While weight isn't directly predictive, his age being 19 might mean he's still developing, which could be associated with higher risk behaviors as he transitions into adulthood.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates; not having education could mean he doesn't have the skills needed for stable employment or effective decision-making.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which might indicate limited opportunities for stability and could contribute to financial dependency issues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for various crimes, including theft, vandalism, etc., and can lead to further legal issues.\n\nIn the past month, he felt extremely down and couldn't be cheered up at all. This level of emotional distress could lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four. Younger siblings might provide support, but living with multiple family members can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behavior due to lack of supervision.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious or moral guidance, which some studies suggest may be associated with higher crime rates.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (2), drug use (past four years), age (19) indicating youth, living alone, limited education, unemployment likely due to no college, emotional distress in the past month. All these factors point towards a high risk of engaging in criminal behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
