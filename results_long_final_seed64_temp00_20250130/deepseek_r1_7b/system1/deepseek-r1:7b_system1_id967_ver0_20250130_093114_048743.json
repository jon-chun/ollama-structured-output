    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have different behaviors compared to older ones. Being White doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but could be a socioeconomic indicator, which I'll consider later.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still indicate some risk because it shows he's been involved in the legal system before. However, since he wasn't convicted, maybe his prior behavior wasn't severe enough to warrant more serious charges.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and weight 140 lbs. This makes him underweight for his height, which might be a sign of malnutrition or lack of proper health, possibly leading to substance abuse issues he's been having.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can increase stress levels and isolation, which are known risk factors for substance abuse and criminal behavior. His current mental state is also important; he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but that might not be related to his drug use.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence job opportunities and social circles. Not being in school might mean he's relying on other factors for support, which could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows responsibility, but if he's not stable or doesn't have a steady income, that could be a risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) suggests ongoing substance abuse issues. Substance abuse can lead to impulsive behaviors and increases the likelihood of engaging in risky activities like criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but if he's dealing with underlying mental health issues, it might not be evident recently. However, his belief in God could mitigate some negative traits, as spirituality often leads to more ethical decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine), which is a strong indicator of risk. His lack of conviction despite an arrest suggests he's not a high-level criminal but still shows previous involvement. His living situation alone adds to potential stressors, and his underweight status might be linked to poor health leading to substance use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I think the risk level is high. The presence of drug use, prior arrest without conviction, living alone, and possible underlying health issues all contribute to a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
