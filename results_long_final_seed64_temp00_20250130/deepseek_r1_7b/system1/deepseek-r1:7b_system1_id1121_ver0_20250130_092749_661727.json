    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in some areas, but that varies widely depending on the context and specific circumstances of each case.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That means he hasn't faced any real consequences for his actions yet. However, arrest is still a negative indicator because it shows he's been involved with the legal system at least once.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight is 135 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like this typically indicate risk unless there are other factors related to health or behavior that might be influenced by them, which isn't evident here.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Lack of education can sometimes lead to unstable situations, but it also means he has the opportunity to seek help if needed. Not being married could affect his stability as well.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness is often linked to higher risk because it can contribute to poverty and lack of support systems. Without a job, he might not have income or skills to move forward.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest he's in better mental health and substance use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That might indicate living conditions that could be challenging, possibly affecting his mental or physical well-being. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might influence his risk level.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could suggest a lack of religious support and some form of spirituality, but it's unclear how this affects his risk without more context.\n\nPutting all these together: He has one arrest, no education or job, living alone in an urban area where crime might be higher, and a potential lack of support from religion. These factors seem to increase the likelihood of him being at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
