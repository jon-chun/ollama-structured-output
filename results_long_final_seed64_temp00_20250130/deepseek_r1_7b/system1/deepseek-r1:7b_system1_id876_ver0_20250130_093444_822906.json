    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female from White background. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment; younger individuals might be more prone to making impulsive decisions. Her race could also play into stereotypes about behavior, though I should be cautious not to make assumptions based solely on race.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's important because being arrested multiple times can indicate prior issues with the law, which might suggest a history of problematic behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it might mean she's managed her time in custody well or perhaps is working towards turning her life around.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 115 lbs. While these factors can sometimes be associated with health issues like obesity, which could affect risk behavior, there isn't a direct link between body size and criminal risk without more context on related health problems or substance use.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently might suggest she has the resources to avoid certain risks but could also indicate past instability if she was previously living with others. Being single can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors, especially if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of support networks.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or not pursuing further education might correlate with lower educational attainment, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates. Individuals without formal education sometimes have fewer opportunities for positive engagement and may turn to other activities that could be risky.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can contribute to financial instability and substance abuse, both of which are risk factors. Without income, she might not have the means to sustain herself or afford necessary precautions, increasing her risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant red flag because it can lead to risky behaviors like self-harm or substance abuse, which are known contributors to recidivism. However, the lack of recent depression might suggest she's managed her mental health, which complicates the risk assessment.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of four at a young age. A stable early home environment is generally protective against many negative outcomes, but if there were issues within that household, it could be a risk factor. The size of the household might indicate more supervision or potential neglect, which isn't directly clear from this information.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; some may turn to spirituality for guidance rather than engaging in risky activities. However, without knowing if she's experiencing mental health issues related to her faith, it's hard to assess the impact on risk behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple factors like prior arrests, drug use, living alone, and lack of education are concerning but not definitively high-risk indicators without more context. The GED and not being in college might suggest she's seeking help, which could be a protective factor. Her belief in God doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's evidence of mental health issues.\n\nI think the overall risk is moderate to low because while there are some concerning factors, others like her GED and lack of recent depression suggest she's proactive about her well-being. However, considering the recidivism rates associated with substance abuse and prior arrests, it might still lean towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
