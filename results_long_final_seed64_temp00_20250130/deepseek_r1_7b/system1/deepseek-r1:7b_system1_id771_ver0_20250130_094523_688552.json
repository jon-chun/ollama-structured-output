    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age-wise, being in his early twenties might be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals who have had more time to establish a stable life. However, without specific data on his behavior or circumstances, it's hard to say just based on age.\n\nHe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending because of the criminal history. Prior convictions are usually strong indicators of past behavior that might lead to similar actions again.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches, which isn't particularly unusual, and his weight is 160 lbs. No information on BMI or health issues related to weight suggests he's at risk for certain health-related crimes, so maybe this factor doesn't add much.\n\nHe's never been married and currently not living alone. Living situation can affect stability; however, without knowing if he has support systems like family or friends, it's hard to assess the impact on his risk level.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked with lower recidivism rates when completed. Not being enrolled might suggest some instability, but again, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk without more context.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues and higher risk of engaging in criminal activities for subsistence or other reasons. However, it depends on his circumstances; if he has support, maybe not as much risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator. Drug abuse is a known contributor to recidivism, so this factor lowers the risk significantly.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can sometimes be linked with substance abuse or other criminal tendencies, but recent lack of depression might suggest better mental health, which could mitigate any risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two. This indicates a stable early family environment, which is generally protective against recidivism unless there are other issues like abuse or neglect mentioned elsewhere (which aren't here).\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be associated with higher levels of religiosity or spirituality, which might correlate with lower risk if he's actively seeking help, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions are a strong red flag. Age is in the early twenties, which isn't necessarily bad on its own, but combined with prior crimes, it raises the risk. The lack of drug use and recent mental health status are positive indicators that might lower the risk despite other factors. However, considering he's only held one job and not married or living alone, these could be mitigating factors.\n\nI think overall, while there are some mitigating points, the prior convictions and lack of stable living situation might still indicate a moderate to high risk. So I would lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
