    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment; younger individuals might be more prone to change or have fewer life experiences that could indicate stability. However, without specific data on his behavior or circumstances, it's hard to say just based on age and race.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Repeated arrests are a strong indicator of criminal history, which typically correlates with higher risk of reoffending. Each arrest adds to the risk profile.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet tall and 135 lbs. While height can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or environments, without additional context like body type or previous issues related to weight, it's not immediately concerning.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and currently single. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate risk unless there are other factors like lack of support network or unstable living conditions. Since he's single and hasn't married yet, this might suggest he's in a vulnerable state but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates; not having a degree could increase risk as he may face barriers to employment or higher chances of involvement in the criminal system.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can contribute to substance abuse, lack of motivation, and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors. Not working for an extended period is a red flag.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with some use in the last month. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to further criminal behavior or safer substance use (e.g., overdosing).\n\nHe felt so down during the past month that nothing could cheer him up. Emotional distress might be linked to substance abuse or other mental health issues, both of which are associated with higher risk.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived in a household of six with both biological parents in a rural area. A large family can sometimes lead to neglect if not properly supervised, but without knowing the living conditions' safety or his relationship with his parents, it's hard to assess this factor's impact on his current risk.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has no role in his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or spirituality, which might influence his behavior and relationships. However, without knowing how this belief affects his daily life or interactions, it's neutral.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and emotional distress are all strong indicators of high risk. The presence of a criminal history alone would suggest a high risk, but combined with other factors like substance abuse and emotional issues, the confidence level should be quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
