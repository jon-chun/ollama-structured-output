    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in certain contexts, but that's more about systemic issues than an individual's specific circumstances.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's only one arrest, which might indicate he hasn't faced significant legal consequences beyond that point. However, it's important to note if the arrest was for a serious offense or something minor, but since it's not specified, I'll consider it as a single non-conviction.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight 185 lbs. No direct correlation between these physical characteristics and criminal risk that I'm aware of unless there are other factors involved, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or other family-related issues, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future criminal behavior; however, not having a degree might suggest he's more likely to seek employment opportunities rather than engage in illegal activities.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences is generally positive as it shows adaptability and willingness to work, which are indicators of stability and self-sufficiency.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to substance abuse or other negative behaviors, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this might indicate he's managed his substance use well.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. A larger family at a young age could suggest exposure to various influences, including potentially more supervision or less protection from potential risks, which might be associated with higher risk behavior later on.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief can sometimes provide a sense of control and purpose, which may reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors compared to those without such beliefs.\n\nPutting all these together, I don't see any clear indicators pointing towards high risk. The factors seem to lean more towards stability and positive influences rather than negatives that would typically indicate a high-risk individual. Therefore, my assessment is that this person does not present as a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
