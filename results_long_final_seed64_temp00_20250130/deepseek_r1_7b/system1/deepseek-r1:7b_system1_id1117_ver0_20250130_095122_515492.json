    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of African American descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's not always directly indicative without more context. So I'll note that but move on.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests are significant because they indicate potential for future involvement in the criminal system. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe there's some hope, but still concerning.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and weight 161 lbs. This doesn't immediately raise red flags unless it's related to substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to stay out of trouble, but again, not directly linked to risk without more info.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor in reducing recidivism; lack of education often correlates with higher risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years and felt down for some months. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior, so this is a red flag.\n\nHis recent emotional state\u2014he feels down and can't be cheered up\u2014suggests possible depression or anxiety, which are mental health issues that could lead to risky behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such conditions might have long-term effects on behavior and relationships, potentially increasing risk.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life. This lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors as individuals may turn to other sources of support or have less accountability.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards high risk\u2014arrests, drug use, emotional issues, living circumstances, and lack of education. While some factors might mitigate the risk a bit, several are strong indicators. Therefore, I'd lean towards high risk with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
