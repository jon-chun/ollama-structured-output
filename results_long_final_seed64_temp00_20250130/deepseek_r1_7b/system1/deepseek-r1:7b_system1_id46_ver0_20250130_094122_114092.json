    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger than typical offenders, but at 21, that's still within the prime years where many high-risk behaviors might occur.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means he's in a suspended sentence situation, which could indicate some reluctance to commit more serious crimes. However, one arrest isn't enough on its own to label him as high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight is 287 lbs. These stats don't immediately raise red flags unless combined with other factors like behavior or medical conditions, which aren't provided here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because it reduces the risk of domestic violence or substance abuse incidents, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could mean he has limited opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use or criminal activity if not motivated enough by personal circumstances.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having a stable job is important for financial stability and reducing stress, but having no job at all might indicate instability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. These are positive indicators that he's maintaining good health and mental well-being, which can reduce the risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to certain environments or family dynamics that might influence his behavior, but without more context, it's hard to assess how significant this is.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be related to religion and its influence on behavior, potentially indicating a lack of guidance which might increase risk if not balanced by other positive factors.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, no prior convictions, living alone (which isn't necessarily bad), limited education, part-time or no job, no drug use, recent positive mental health. The negative points are his age and the belief in a lack of religious influence.\n\nI think the key here is that he has only one arrest, which might suggest he's aware of his actions but hasn't acted on them yet. His lack of education and employment could be significant risk factors because they provide opportunities for engaging in risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
