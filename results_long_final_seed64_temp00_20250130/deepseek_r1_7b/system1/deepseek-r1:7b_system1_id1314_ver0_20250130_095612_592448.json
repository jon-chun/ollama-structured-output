    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 21 isn't necessarily a red flag unless there's something else indicating immaturity, but I don't see that here. Being Black might be a sensitive factor, but without more context on systemic issues or discrimination, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future behavior issues, but since he hasn't been convicted, maybe there's less immediate risk from this. However, two arrests could suggest some instability or past legal issues.\n\nHe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs. That seems within a normal range; no indication of being overweight which might relate to other risks like heart disease, but that's not directly tied to criminal risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, which could influence behavior, but again, it's more about personal circumstances than direct risk factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can affect job opportunities and future stability, but not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like lack of motivation for higher education or career advancement.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Single job experience might indicate some employability, but it's also possible he's unemployed or underemployed, which could be a risk factor if he's not stable economically.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive indicators; substance abuse and mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so their absence is good news.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with five people. That's a large household for someone his age. Living with multiple family members could indicate potential for conflict or instability, which might influence behavior in the future.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide guidance but don't directly correlate with criminal risk unless there are underlying issues like lack of faith in personal decisions.\n\nPutting this all together: two arrests, no convictions, living alone, single job, no drug use, positive mental health, and a large household at 21. While some factors could indicate potential for instability or future issues, the absence of convictions, substance abuse, and mental health problems suggests that while there's always risk, this individual might not be in immediate danger.\n\nI think the confidence level should be moderate because there are no clear red flags but also nothing that definitively points to low risk. So maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
