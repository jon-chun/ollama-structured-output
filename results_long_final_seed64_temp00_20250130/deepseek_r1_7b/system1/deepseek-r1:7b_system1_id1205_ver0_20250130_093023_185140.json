    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female of African American descent. There's some research suggesting that Black individuals may have higher recidivism rates compared to other racial groups, so that could be a red flag.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might indicate prior issues or maybe she's actively working on her case. However, one arrest alone isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to her risk level unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk for certain issues, but without more context on her living situation or personal circumstances, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is generally positively correlated with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually reduce her risk.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant factor in recidivism, especially if it's due to systemic issues or lack of access to opportunities. However, not working alone doesn't necessarily mean she's at high risk; it depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Drug use and mental health are important indicators. Her positive drug test and lack of recent depression symptoms might suggest better mental health, which could lower her risk.\n\nShe lived at a young age with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can have both positive and negative effects. Urban areas often have more resources but also higher stressors. However, living with her mother suggests she has a stable environment, which is usually protective against recidivism.\n\nShe believes that God has nothing to do with her personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or belief in a higher power, which might affect her mental health and decision-making. Some studies suggest that lack of religious affiliation can be associated with increased risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The single arrest without a conviction is a point towards high risk, but other factors like education, no job, positive drug use, and living with her mother might mitigate some of that risk. However, considering the potential impact of her religious beliefs and the lack of a stable support system, she might still be at moderate to higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
