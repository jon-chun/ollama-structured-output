    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is usually not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean less life experience. However, it's not immediately concerning unless there are other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a red flag. Repeated convictions, especially for serious crimes, can significantly increase risk of reoffending. So that's a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue with his weight unless it's related to health problems, but there's no mention here. Maybe it's more about how it affects his job or ability to support himself, but that's speculative.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability from a relationship can be protective against certain risks, so maybe this isn't as concerning on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is important; not completing higher education might correlate with more risk-taking behavior or less stable situations, but it's not directly a high risk indicator unless combined with other factors like substance use.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues, which might increase risk of involvement in the criminal system again. But again, this alone isn't enough without more context.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behavior, and lead to other negative outcomes. However, he's not feeling depressed now, which might suggest some level of control or resilience.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household in an urban setting could have its pros and cons. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but also may be associated with higher stress or exposure to negative influences. However, without knowing the family dynamics or surrounding environment, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This is a positive factor as religious beliefs often provide moral guidance and support for maintaining stability.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. The other factors like drug use and living situation might add some context but don't outweigh the significant risk from past convictions. Therefore, I would lean towards high risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
