    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have different behaviors compared to older ones. Being White doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but could be a socioeconomic indicator, which I'll consider later.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. Each prior offense increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities again.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 2 inches and 275 lbs. While weight can be an indicator, it's not always directly correlated with criminal liability unless there's evidence of substance abuse or health issues. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might suggest he's mentally stable, but I should check if depression is a risk factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Living with someone can provide support and reduce stress, which might lower the risk of criminal behavior. However, it doesn't negate other risk factors entirely.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education level is inversely related to recidivism; those with higher education are less likely to reoffend. Not attending college could be a sign of disengagement or potential for alternative activities.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having stable employment can reduce the need for illegal activities, but it's possible he might have inconsistent income leading him towards other risks.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse is a major risk factor as it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to criminal behavior such as theft or violence.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While this suggests mental health stability, if he has a history of depression before, that could be a concern. However, recent positive feelings might mitigate that.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a large household can lead to stress and dependency on substances or other activities. Urban environments often have higher rates of crime and substance abuse.\n\nBelieves in God: This is more about personal spirituality rather than criminal behavior directly. However, some religious beliefs might correlate with certain risk-taking behaviors if they promote unethical conduct.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are a strong indicator. Drug use is concerning. Age being young could mean he's still developing and might be more susceptible to negative influences. Living in an urban area with high crime rates adds to the risk. His belief in God doesn't directly contribute but shouldn't be ignored as part of his overall profile.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think this individual has a high risk of reoffending. The prior convictions alone suggest he's likely to engage in criminal behavior again. Drug use and living conditions further increase that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
