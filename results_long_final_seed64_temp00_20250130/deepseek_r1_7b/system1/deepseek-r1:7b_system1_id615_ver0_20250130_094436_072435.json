    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger than typical offenders, but at 21, he's still relatively young and in his prime years for being active in the workforce. Being White doesn't inherently make someone more or less risky; it's more about individual circumstances.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly correlated with recidivism. Recidivism is the tendency to reoffend after release, so this could indicate he might be at risk of returning to prison.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, and his weight is 165 lbs. These physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk unless there's a specific reason they would, like if someone was considered dangerous based on size or appearance, but that doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or other family-related issues. However, it could also indicate independence, which might not necessarily correlate with higher risk if he's self-sufficient.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not having a degree doesn't inherently make someone more or less risky. Some individuals drop out of school to seek better opportunities or escape certain environments. His decision to live alone could be related to his education level, but it's not directly indicative of risk without further context.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job stability is another factor; having a steady job can contribute to financial stability and reducing recidivism. However, if he lost his job recently or is unemployed, that might indicate underlying issues, but since he's holding one job, it suggests some level of employability.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use can have various implications. It could be a sign of addiction, which might lead to other problems like health issues or unstable living situations. However, if he hasn't felt depressed recently, that might suggest he's managed his substance use without severe emotional distress.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. This indicates a stable early life environment, which is generally protective against many negative outcomes, including criminal behavior. Urban environments can sometimes be more diverse and offer different risks compared to rural areas, but having both parents present suggests a secure base.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could relate to his religious background or lack thereof. Some individuals may turn to religion for guidance, so this belief might not directly correlate with risk unless it affects his decision-making in other areas.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk because they increase the likelihood of reoffending. The presence of drug use could be concerning but without more context on how it's affecting his life (e.g., causing problems), it might not be as significant. His living situation with both parents in an urban area is protective, which would lower the risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, while there are some red flags like prior convictions and drug use, the presence of a stable living environment and job suggests he's less likely to be at high risk. However, the prior conviction alone might still push him into a higher risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThe prediction is YES with a confidence of 75% because the individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending. While other factors like living with both parents and job stability are protective, the prior conviction alone suggests a high risk.",
