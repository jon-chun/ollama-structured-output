    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is typically not a strong indicator on its own unless it's significantly older or younger than average in the population. Her ethnicity might be relevant if there are specific statistics about crime rates among White individuals, but I don't have that information here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still indicate some level of risk, especially if she's showing signs of substance use or mental health issues. But since she hasn't used drugs in the past four years and her mood is described as down, this might mitigate that risk.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and weight 115 lbs. These are within normal ranges for a 22-year-old female, so no red flags there.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher crime rates because she has fewer social ties to support her or deter her from engaging in risky behavior. However, this is just one factor among many.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might correlate with lower involvement in the criminal justice system, but it's not necessarily an indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities can reduce the likelihood of being unemployed and thus more likely to engage in illegal activities if she were. However, this doesn't directly indicate risk; it's more about stability.\n\nHer drug use history is clean for the past four years, which is a positive indicator as substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior.\n\nShe reported feeling down most of the time during the past month. Persistent negative mood can be a sign of mental health issues or stress, both of which might influence her risk-taking behavior. However, if she's not using drugs and seems to have other coping mechanisms, this might not be as concerning.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This could imply exposure to family dynamics that might include neglect or abuse, which can increase risk factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates compared to rural areas, so this is another point towards high risk.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal events. This religious belief might influence her behavior; some individuals use religion as a coping mechanism for stress and negative emotions, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like anxiety or depression.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest without a conviction, living alone, potential family environment, and some signs of emotional distress. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk. Considering the lack of convictions despite an arrest, she might be at higher risk for reoffending if she were to commit another crime.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
