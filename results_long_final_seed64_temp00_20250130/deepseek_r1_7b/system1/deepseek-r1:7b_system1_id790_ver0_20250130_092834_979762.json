    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have less life experience, but it doesn't automatically make them high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That means he hasn't fully completed the legal process for that offense, which could indicate some reluctance or maybe a minor infraction. However, one arrest isn't typically enough to label someone as high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and his weight is between 175-199 lbs. That's within a normal BMI range, so no indication of substance abuse from his weight alone.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because it reduces the risk of domestic violence or other family-related issues, but it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future criminal behavior; having a diploma might suggest he's more likely to seek better opportunities rather than engage in illegal activities.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having stable employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this factor doesn't point towards high risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to substance abuse or other behaviors that could increase risk. However, since he's not feeling depressed now and only uses marijuana, maybe it's less concerning.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can sometimes lead to higher rates of certain issues, but without more info on family dynamics or other factors like abuse or neglect, it's hard to say if this increases risk.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; however, belief alone doesn't predict criminal behavior unless there are specific circumstances involved.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, no prior convictions, living situation with parents, normal weight, stable job, high school diploma, two jobs, moderate marijuana use without recent depression. These factors don't strongly indicate a high risk of reoffending. The low confidence level makes sense because the risk isn't very high based on the given information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
