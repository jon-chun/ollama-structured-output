    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have different behaviors compared to older adults. Being White doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior but could be a socioeconomic indicator, which I'll consider later.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still indicate some risk because it shows he's been involved in the legal system before. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe his prior behavior wasn't severe enough to result in a full sentence.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 165 lbs. This makes him tall but not necessarily overweight unless combined with body fat. His BMI isn't provided, so I can't assess that directly. Tall individuals might have different health risks or stressors, but without more info on his health, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because isolation increases stress and substance use. He could be dealing with personal issues or relying on others for support, which affects his stability.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED shows some educational background but not necessarily the ability to secure employment. Not being enrolled might indicate he's seeking further education, which is positive, but if he's not gaining skills, it could be a risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience can be beneficial as it provides income and stability. Two jobs suggest some financial independence, which reduces recidivism risk compared to someone without employment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is mentioned. Drug use, especially marijuana, isn't as severe as harder drugs but can still have negative consequences on health and behavior. It might also indicate underlying mental health issues if he hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent depression could suggest he's mentally stable, which is a positive sign. However, drug use in the past four years without recent depression might hint at other stressors or substance abuse problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. High household size can lead to more stress and less supervision for children. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, which could increase his exposure to negative influences.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might provide some moral guidance but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless it's inconsistent with other factors, like substance use or behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a prior arrest without a conviction, which is a minor risk factor. His living situation in an urban area with many family members could be stressful. He's not enrolled in college and has a GED, but he's employed twice, which is positive. Drug use (marijuana) and lack of recent depression are concerning but might indicate underlying issues rather than active substance abuse.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk isn't extremely high, but there are some indicators that could contribute to him being at risk for future offenses or substance use issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning is based on the presence of a prior arrest without a conviction and living in an urban area with high household stress, which are moderate indicators suggesting a higher risk.",
