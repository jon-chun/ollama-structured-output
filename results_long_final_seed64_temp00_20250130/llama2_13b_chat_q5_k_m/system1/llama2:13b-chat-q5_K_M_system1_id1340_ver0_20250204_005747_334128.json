    "raw_message_text": " {\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the provided risk factors, there are several factors that suggest a low risk of recidivism:\n\n1. Lack of prior convictions: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating that they may be a first-time offender and less likely to reoffend.\n2. Young age: At 20 years old, the individual is still in the early stages of adulthood and may be more malleable to positive influences and less likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n3. No history of drug use: The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, which suggests that they may be less likely to engage in risky behaviors.\n4. Stable living situation: The individual is not living alone and has never been married, which suggests that they have a support system in place.\n5. No history of depression: The individual has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that they may be less likely to engage in risky behaviors due to mental health issues.\n\nHowever, there are also some factors that suggest a moderate risk of recidivism:\n\n1. Lack of education: The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which may limit their job opportunities and increase their likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n2. Limited employment history: The individual has only held one job during the year, which suggests that they may be struggling financially and more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nOverall, based on these risk factors, the prediction is NO with a confidence level of 60%. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based solely on the provided risk factors and does not take into account other relevant information that may be available.",
