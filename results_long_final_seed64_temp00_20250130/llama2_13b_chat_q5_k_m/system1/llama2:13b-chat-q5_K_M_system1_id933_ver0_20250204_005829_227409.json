Lack of prior convictions: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating that they may be a first-time offender and less likely to reoffend.\n2. Young age: At 18 years old, the individual is still in the early stages of adulthood and may be more malleable to positive influences and less likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n3. No history of drug use: The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, which suggests that they may be less likely to engage in risky or criminal behavior.\n4. Stable living situation: The individual is living alone but has a stable living situation, which can provide a sense of stability and security.\n5. No history of depression: The individual has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that they may be in a good mental state and less likely to engage in risky or criminal behavior.\n6. Positive influence of religion: The individual believes that God has something to do with what happens to them personally, which may provide a positive influence and sense of accountability.\n\nHowever, there are also some factors that suggest a moderate risk of recidivism:\n\n1. Lack of education: The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which can limit their job opportunities and increase their likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n2. Limited employment history: The individual has only held one job during the year, which may indicate a lack of stability and consistency in their life.\n\nOverall, based on these risk factors, the prediction is that the individual is at low to moderate risk of recidivism, with a confidence level of 60%.",
