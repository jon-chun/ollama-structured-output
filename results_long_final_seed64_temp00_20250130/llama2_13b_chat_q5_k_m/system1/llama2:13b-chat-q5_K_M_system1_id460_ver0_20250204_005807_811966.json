Firstly, the individual has not been convicted of any crime, which indicates that they have not had a previous criminal record. Additionally, they have never been married and do not live alone, which suggests that they have a support system in place. Furthermore, they have held multiple jobs during the year, which indicates stability and responsibility.\n\nHowever, there are also some factors that suggest a moderate risk of recidivism. The individual has used drugs in the past four years, which could indicate a potential for substance abuse and criminal behavior. Additionally, their lack of religious beliefs may suggest a lack of moral guidance or support.\n\nOverall, based on the provided risk factors, the prediction is NO with a confidence level of 70%. This means that it is unlikely that the individual will recidivate, but there is still a moderate risk present.",
