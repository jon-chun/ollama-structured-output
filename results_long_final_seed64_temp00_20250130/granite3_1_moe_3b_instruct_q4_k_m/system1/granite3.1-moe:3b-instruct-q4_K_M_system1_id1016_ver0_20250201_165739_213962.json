Their age, weight, and height are within normal ranges for an 18-year-old female. Her education level is low but she has held one job, indicating some stability in her life. She does not use drugs or report depression, which are positive signs. However, the fact that she considers God's involvement in personal matters could potentially indicate a lack of accountability and responsibility. The confidence level is set at 50% as these factors do not fully determine risk; they suggest a high-risk profile but require further contextual analysis.",
