    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. She has been arrested three times but not convicted, weighs 162 lbs, does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, and is currently not living with her parents. She has held three jobs during the year and uses marijuana and cocaine, but has not felt depressed in the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area and believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested three times but not convicted. This is a significant factor. Let me assign it a high weight because repeated arrests, even if not convictions, indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\n   \n2. **Age and Living Situation**: At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which can be a critical period for development and decision-making. Not living with parents might suggest independence issues or other challenges. I'll assign this a medium weight because while it's important, it doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Education**: Without a high school diploma or GED certificate, she likely has limited educational opportunities. This can affect her job prospects and future stability. I'll assign this a medium weight as well, since education is generally linked to better life outcomes but not always directly to criminal activity.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: Using marijuana and cocaine suggests substance abuse issues. While it's important, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed in the past month might indicate some resilience. I'll assign this a low weight because drug use can be a factor in criminal behavior, but the absence of depression suggests she might be managing her addiction.\n\n5. **Belief in God**: Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally could indicate a lack of moral compass or a rebellious attitude towards authority. This is significant and should be assigned a high weight because it can influence her willingness to follow laws and respect the legal system.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: Currently not living with parents might suggest independence issues, but this doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior. I'll assign this a medium weight as well.\n\nNow, let me combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- High: Arrest History\n- Medium: Age and Living Situation, Education, Belief in God\n- Low: Drug Use\n\nGiven these weights, the overall confidence level is moderate. The arrest history and belief in God are significant factors, while age, education, and living situation are important but less directly correlated to criminal behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Age and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Young age and not living with parents may suggest independence issues or other challenges, but this does not directly correlate to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Limited education opportunities may affect job prospects and life outcomes, but is not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine suggests substance abuse issues, but the absence of depression in the past month may indicate some resilience.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally could indicate a lack of moral compass or rebellious attitude towards authority.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently not living with parents may suggest independence issues, but this does not directly correlate to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
