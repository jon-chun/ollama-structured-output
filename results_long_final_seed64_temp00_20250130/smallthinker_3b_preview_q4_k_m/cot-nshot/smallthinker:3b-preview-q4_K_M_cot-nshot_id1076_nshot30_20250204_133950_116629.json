    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.\n- He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n- His height and weight range are between 6 feet 2 inches and 200 to 224 lbs.\n- He has never been married and is currently living alone.\n- He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- He has held 2 jobs during the year.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- At a young age, he lived in a household of size 3.\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to each risk factor based on the analysis of the n-shot examples:\n\n1. Arrest History: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests a low risk for future arrests.\n2. Age and Living Situation: Being 19 years old and living alone might indicate some level of independence, which could be neutral or slightly positive.\n3. Education Level: No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates a lower educational attainment, which is generally associated with higher recidivism rates.\n4. Employment Status: Holding only 2 jobs during the year suggests limited work experience and possibly lower employability.\n5. Drug Use: Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana) indicates a history of substance use, which could be a moderate risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n6. Household Size: Living alone might indicate some level of independence, but this is not directly related to recidivism.\n7. Belief in Divine Intervention: This belief does not seem to have a direct impact on recidivism rates.\n\nLet me check the weights again and ensure they align with the analysis:\n\n1. Arrest History: Low (the person has been arrested once but not convicted, suggesting a low risk for future arrests).\n2. Age and Living Situation: Medium (being 19 years old and living alone might indicate some level of independence, which could be neutral or slightly positive).\n3. Education Level: High (no high school diploma or GED certificate indicates a lower educational attainment, which is generally associated with higher recidivism rates).\n4. Employment Status: Medium (holding only 2 jobs during the year suggests limited work experience and possibly lower employability).\n5. Drug Use: Medium (using drugs in the past four years (marijuana) indicates a history of substance use, which could be a moderate risk factor for future criminal behavior).\n6. Household Size: Low (living alone might indicate some level of independence, but this is not directly related to recidivism).\n7. Belief in Divine Intervention: Low (this belief does not seem to have a direct impact on recidivism rates).\n\nNow, let's use these weights to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrest History: Low\n- Age and Living Situation: Medium\n- Education Level: High\n- Employment Status: Medium\n- Drug Use: Medium\n- Household Size: Low\n- Belief in Divine Intervention: Low\n\nGiven these weights, the collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, suggesting a low risk for future arrests.\"),\n    (\"Age and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Being 19 years old and living alone might indicate some level of independence, which could be neutral or slightly positive.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates a lower educational attainment, which is generally associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only 2 jobs during the year suggests limited work experience and possibly lower employability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana) indicates a history of substance use, which could be a moderate risk factor for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate some level of independence, but this is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Divine Intervention\", \"low\", \"This belief does not seem to have a direct impact on recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
