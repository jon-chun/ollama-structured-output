    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. She has been arrested once but not convicted, weighs 134 lbs, lives alone, has a high school diploma, held two jobs in a year, used marijuana in the past four years, and feels down sometimes. She also considers God's influence on her life.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I'll consider the arrest history. The fact that she was arrested once but not convicted is significant. This suggests some level of risk, but it's not a severe offense. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of weight.\n\nNext, her age and gender are important. Being 20 years old means she's still young and has a lot of potential for growth. However, the fact that she identifies as Black might indicate some level of systemic disadvantage. This factor will be assigned as \"low\" in terms of weight.\n\nHer living situation is another key point. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation or other issues, but it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of weight.\n\nThe number of jobs she's held in a year could indicate instability or lack of commitment. This factor will be assigned as \"low\" in terms of weight.\n\nHer body mass index (BMI) is 134 lbs, which is slightly underweight. While being underweight might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, it could indicate some level of health issues that might affect her life choices. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of weight.\n\nThe use of marijuana in the past four years suggests a potential substance abuse issue. This factor will be assigned as \"low\" in terms of weight.\n\nFinally, her consideration of God's influence on her life indicates some level of moral or spiritual guidance. This factor will be assigned as \"high\" in terms of weight.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrest history: medium\n- Age and gender: low\n- Living situation: medium\n- Number of jobs: low\n- BMI: medium\n- Substance abuse: low\n- Spiritual guidance: high\n\nLet's calculate the weighted average:\n\n- Arrest history (medium): 0.33\n- Age and gender (low): 0.17\n- Living situation (medium): 0.33\n- Number of jobs (low): 0.17\n- BMI (medium): 0.25\n- Substance abuse (low): 0.17\n- Spiritual guidance (high): 0.44\n\nThe weighted average is:\n\n(0.33 + 0.17 + 0.33 + 0.17 + 0.25 + 0.17 + 0.44) / 7 = 0.30\n\nBased on this weighted average, I predict a low to medium risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"bmi\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"spiritual_guidance\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
