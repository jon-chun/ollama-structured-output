    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Asian / Pacific Islander. He has been arrested once but was convicted, is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 145 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college, has used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years, and feels down sometimes. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The individual has been arrested once but was convicted. This is a significant factor.\n2. **Conviction Status**: Being convicted adds weight to the arrest history.\n3. **Age and Height/Weight**: These factors are relatively neutral in terms of recidivism risk.\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married, which might indicate some level of independence but not necessarily relevant to recidivism.\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone could be a factor, as it might affect social support networks.\n6. **Education Level**: Holding a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests an ongoing commitment to education and possibly personal growth.\n7. **Drug Use History**: Using drugs (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant risk factor.\n8. **Belief in God's Influence**: Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of social support network.\n\nLet me break this down further:\n\n- **Arrest and Conviction History**: This is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, so I'll assign it a high weight.\n- **Drug Use History**: Using drugs in the past four years is another strong indicator, so I'll also assign it a high weight.\n- **Belief in God's Influence**: The lack of belief indicates a potential lack of social support network, which could be a medium weight factor.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- High arrest and conviction history\n- High drug use history\n- Medium belief in God's influence\n\nGiven these factors, I can confidently say that the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is \"YES\" with a high confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested once but was convicted, which significantly increases the risk of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Conviction Status\", \"high\", \"Being convicted adds weight to the arrest history and indicates a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age and Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"These factors are relatively neutral in terms of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate some level of independence, but it's not directly related to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could be a factor, as it might affect social support networks and potentially increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Holding a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests an ongoing commitment to education and possibly personal growth, which is not directly related to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Using drugs (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant risk factor for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"medium\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of social support network, which could be a medium weight factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
