    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. She lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate, has held three jobs in a year, and uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine. Additionally, she considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of criminal behavior.\n2. **Education Level**: She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate. This suggests she may lack the educational foundation to navigate society effectively without legal issues.\n3. **Employment Status**: She has held three jobs in a year. While this shows some stability, it also indicates that she might be struggling with finding long-term employment due to her criminal history and lack of education.\n4. **Drug Use**: She uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine. This is a clear risk factor for further criminal behavior.\n5. **Belief in God's Influence**: Her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests she might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors without considering the consequences.\n\nLet me break this down further:\n\n- **Arrest History**: Low confidence, as it's only one instance and not a conviction.\n- **Education Level**: Medium confidence, as lacking a diploma or GED certificate is a significant barrier but not the sole determinant of future behavior.\n- **Employment Status**: High confidence, given her struggle with finding stable employment due to criminal history and lack of education.\n- **Drug Use**: High confidence, as drug use is strongly correlated with increased criminal activity.\n- **Belief in God's Influence**: Low confidence, as this belief doesn't directly correlate to future behavior without other factors.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors:\n\n- Arrest History: Medium (1 out of 3)\n- Education Level: Medium (2 out of 3)\n- Employment Status: High (3 out of 3)\n- Drug Use: High (4 out of 4)\n- Belief in God's Influence: Low (1 out of 3)\n\nLet me check the overall confidence level. Given that three factors are high and one is medium, I'll assign a high confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Low confidence due to only one instance\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Medium confidence as lacking diploma or GED certificate is significant but not the sole determinant\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"High confidence given struggle with stable employment due to criminal history and lack of education\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"High confidence as drug use strongly correlates with increased criminal activity\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"low\", \"Low confidence as this belief doesn't directly correlate to future behavior without other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
