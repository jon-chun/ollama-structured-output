    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic.\n- He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n- His height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight is 199 lbs.\n- He has never been married and lives alone.\n- He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- He has held 3 jobs during the year.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5.\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to each factor based on the given examples. I'll start with the most critical factors and work my way down.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor.\n2. **Age at First Arrest**: The case does not specify the age at first arrest, so this factor cannot be assigned.\n3. **Education Level**: He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which is a strong indicator of risk.\n4. **Employment Status**: He has held 3 jobs during the year, which might indicate some stability but also potential for job-related issues.\n5. **Drug Use History**: He has used drugs in the past four years, which is another significant factor.\n6. **Family Background**: He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, which could be relevant.\n7. **Religious Belief**: His belief in God might influence his behavior but is less directly related to recidivism.\n\nLet me think about the weights for each factor:\n- **Arrest History**: High (0.4)\n- **Education Level**: High (0.35)\n- **Drug Use History**: High (0.25)\n- **Family Background**: Medium (0.1)\n\nNow, let's consider the prediction. Given the high weight on arrest history and drug use history, along with a medium weight on education level and family background, I predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome of \"YES\".\n\nLet me check my reasoning one more time to ensure everything is in place.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, which is a significant factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, indicating a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He has used drugs in the past four years, which is another significant factor.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, which could be relevant but less directly related to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
