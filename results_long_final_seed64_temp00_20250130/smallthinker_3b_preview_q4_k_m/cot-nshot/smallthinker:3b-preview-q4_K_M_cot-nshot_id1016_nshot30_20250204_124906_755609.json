    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black.\n- She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted.\n- Her height and weight are given, but these might not be directly relevant to recidivism.\n- She has never been married and lives alone.\n- She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- She has held only one job during the year.\n- She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month.\n- At a young age, she lived in a household of size 6.\n- She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to each factor based on the given examples. I'll start with the most critical factors and work my way down.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested multiple times but not convicted. This suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future arrests.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Education Level**: She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which indicates a lower level of education and potentially fewer job opportunities.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **Employment Status**: She has held only one job during the year, suggesting limited employment history.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n4. **Drug Use History**: She has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n5. **Depression History**: She has not felt depressed over the past month, which is also a positive factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Family Background**: At a young age, she lived in a household of size 6, which might indicate family issues but is not directly relevant to recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n7. **Spiritual Belief**: She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, which could influence her behavior and decision-making.\n   - Weight: Low\n\nNow, let's use these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given the high weight on arrest history and medium weights on education level and family background, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\nLet me check my reasoning again to ensure all factors are considered. Yes, it seems comprehensive.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without conviction suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future arrests.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates a lower level of education and potentially fewer job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Only one job during the year suggests limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"Depression History\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month is also a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of size 6 at a young age, which might indicate family issues but is not directly relevant to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role suggests potential influence on behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
