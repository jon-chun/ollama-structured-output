    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case and assign a relative weight to each factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: The person has been arrested 11 times and convicted. This is a significant number and indicates a pattern of criminal behavior.\n2. **Age**: The person is 18 years old. At this age, there are still many developmental aspects to consider, but the frequency of arrests suggests a higher risk.\n3. **Weight Range**: The weight range is between 175 and 199 lbs. This doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so it's likely a low-risk factor.\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married. This doesn't seem to have any direct correlation with criminal behavior.\n5. **Education Level**: High school diploma. This is a basic level of education and might not significantly impact the risk of rearrest.\n6. **Job History**: Only one job during the year. This could indicate unemployment, which might be related to substance abuse or other issues.\n7. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years. This is a significant factor as it suggests ongoing involvement with substances that can lead to criminal behavior.\n8. **Living Situation**: Currently not living alone. This doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n9. **Religious Belief**: Considers God's influence on life. This might indicate a higher likelihood of rehabilitation or reduced recidivism.\n\nNow, let me assign weights to these factors based on their perceived impact:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: High\n2. **Age**: Medium\n3. **Weight Range**: Low\n4. **Marital Status**: Low\n5. **Education Level**: Low\n6. **Job History**: Medium\n7. **Drug Use**: High\n8. **Living Situation**: Low\n9. **Religious Belief**: Medium\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I'm following the correct format and guidelines.\n\nNow, let's use these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- The high number of arrests and drug use significantly increase the risk.\n- The age factor is medium, indicating some developmental aspects but still a concern.\n- The weight range and living situation are low-risk factors.\n- The education level and job history are also low-risk factors.\n\nGiven these considerations, I predict that this case will have a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism. Let me think about the confidence level:\n\n- The combination of frequent arrests and drug use suggests a pattern of criminal behavior.\n- The age factor adds some uncertainty but doesn't significantly change the overall risk assessment.\n- The other factors reinforce the idea that this individual is at a higher risk.\n\nTherefore, I will assign a high confidence level to this prediction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested 11 times and convicted, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Being 18 years old may indicate some developmental aspects that could influence risk but the frequency of arrests suggests a higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight Range\", \"low\", \"The weight range does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married doesn't seem to have any direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a basic level of education and might not significantly impact the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year could indicate unemployment, which might be related to substance abuse or other issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, suggesting ongoing involvement with substances that can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Currently not living alone doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Considers God's influence on life, which might indicate a higher likelihood of rehabilitation or reduced recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
