    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 22-year-old Black female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors:\n\n1. **Previous Arrests**: The individual has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor.\n2. **Age at First Offense**: The age at first offense isn't specified, so I'll assume it's relevant but not directly provided.\n3. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma, which might be a moderate risk factor.\n4. **Employment Status**: Currently living alone and holding only one job in the past year, this could indicate a low risk of recidivism due to stability.\n5. **Drug Use History**: She has used drugs in the past four years, which is a high-risk factor.\n6. **Community Type**: The rural area might influence her social network and support system.\n\nLet me check each factor carefully:\n\n1. **Previous Arrests**: This is a clear indicator of recidivism risk. Given that she has been convicted once, this factor should be weighted as \"high.\"\n2. **Age at First Offense**: Without specific information, I'll assume it's relevant but not directly provided.\n3. **Education Level**: A high school diploma might indicate some level of education and possibly a lower recidivism risk due to better life skills. This could be a \"medium\" weight.\n4. **Employment Status**: Currently living alone and holding only one job in the past year suggests stability, which is likely to reduce recidivism risk. This should be a \"low\" weight.\n5. **Drug Use History**: Using drugs in the past four years significantly increases the risk of recidivism. This factor should be weighted as \"high.\"\n6. **Community Type**: Living in a rural area might influence her social network and support system, potentially affecting her likelihood of recidivism. This could be a \"medium\" weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- High risk from previous arrests and drug use.\n- Medium risk from education level and community type.\n- Low risk from employment status.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict a moderate likelihood of recidivism. Let me think about the confidence level... Considering all factors, I'll assign a 60% confidence to this prediction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted once, indicating a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age at First Offense\", \"medium\", \"Without specific information on the age at first offense, it's considered a medium weight factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma may indicate some level of education and potentially lower recidivism risk due to better life skills.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone and holding only one job in the past year suggests stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Community Type\", \"medium\", \"Living in a rural area may influence her social network and support system, affecting recidivism likelihood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
