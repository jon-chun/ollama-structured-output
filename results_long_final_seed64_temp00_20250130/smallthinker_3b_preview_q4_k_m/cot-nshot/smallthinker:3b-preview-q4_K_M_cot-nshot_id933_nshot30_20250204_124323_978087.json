    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n- He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 185 lbs.\n- He has never been married and is currently living alone.\n- He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- He has held 1 job during the year.\n- He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month.\n- At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5.\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to each risk factor based on the provided n-shot examples. I'll start with the most obvious ones and then move to more nuanced factors.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested 1 time but not convicted. This is a significant factor.\n2. **Age at Arrest**: The person is 18 years old, which is relatively young.\n3. **Education Level**: He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate.\n4. **Employment Status**: He has held only 1 job during the year.\n5. **Drug Use History**: He has not used any drugs in the past four years.\n6. **Depression History**: He has not felt depressed over the past month.\n7. **Family Background**: He lived with both biological parents at a young age.\n8. **Spiritual Belief**: He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me think about each factor carefully:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: This is a significant factor, so I'll assign it a high weight.\n2. **Age at Arrest**: Being 18 years old makes this a medium-weight factor.\n3. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED certificate means this is a high-weight factor.\n4. **Employment Status**: Only 1 job in the past year is a medium-weight factor.\n5. **Drug Use History**: No drug use in the past four years is a low-weight factor.\n6. **Depression History**: No depression history in the past month is a low-weight factor.\n7. **Family Background**: Living with both biological parents at a young age is a medium-weight factor.\n8. **Spiritual Belief**: Considering God's role is a low-weight factor.\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given the high weight of arrest history and education level, along with medium weights for family background and employment status, I'll predict a \"YES\" for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet me check my reasoning one more time before finalizing:\n\n- High-weight factors: Arrest History (high), Education Level (high)\n- Medium-weight factors: Age at Arrest (medium), Family Background (medium), Employment Status (medium)\n- Low-weight factors: Drug Use History (low), Depression History (low), Spiritual Belief (low)\n\nGiven this, the collective prediction should be a \"YES\" for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested 1 time but not convicted.\"),\n    (\"Age at Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The person is 18 years old.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"He has held only 1 job during the year.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years.\"),\n    (\"Depression History\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"He lived with both biological parents at a young age.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
