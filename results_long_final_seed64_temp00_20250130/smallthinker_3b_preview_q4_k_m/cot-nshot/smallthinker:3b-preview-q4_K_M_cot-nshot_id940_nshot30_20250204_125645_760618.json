    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements of the case:\n- The person is a 19-year-old female.\n- She has been arrested once but not convicted.\n- Her height and weight are given, but these might not be directly relevant to recidivism.\n- She has never been married and lives alone.\n- She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college.\n- She has held only one job during the year.\n- She has used cocaine in the past four years.\n- At a young age, she lived with both biological parents.\n\nNow, let's consider each risk factor and assign a weight:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of criminal activity.\n2. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education might reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\n3. **Employment Status**: She has held only one job during the year. This could indicate instability or lack of commitment to employment, which might increase the risk of recidivism.\n4. **Substance Use**: She has used cocaine in the past four years. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n5. **Living Situation**: She lives alone and has never been married. Living alone might indicate independence but could also suggest a lack of support system.\n6. **Age at First Arrest**: At a young age, she lived with both biological parents. This suggests that her environment may have influenced her behavior.\n\nLet me think about the weights for each factor:\n- **Arrest History**: High (0.4)\n- **Education Level**: Medium (0.3)\n- **Employment Status**: Low (0.1)\n- **Substance Use**: High (0.25)\n- **Living Situation**: Medium (0.15)\n- **Age at First Arrest**: Medium (0.1)\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n- The arrest history and substance use are both high risk factors.\n- The education level is a medium risk factor.\n- The employment status and living situation are low risk factors.\n\nGiven this analysis, I can confidently say that the person has a moderate to high likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Therefore, my prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some level of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which may reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"She has held only one job during the year, suggesting instability or lack of commitment to employment.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"She has used cocaine in the past four years, indicating a history of substance use which is strongly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"She lives alone and has never been married, which may indicate independence but also potentially lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"Age at First Arrest\", \"medium\", \"At a young age, she lived with both biological parents, suggesting that her environment may have influenced her behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
