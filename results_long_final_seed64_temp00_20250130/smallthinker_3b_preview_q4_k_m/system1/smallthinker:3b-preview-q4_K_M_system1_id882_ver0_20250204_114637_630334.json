    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 18 years old - This is relatively young.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - No specific racial or ethnic risk indicators are mentioned.\n- Arrest history: 1 arrest, not convicted - A single arrest without conviction might suggest some level of involvement in law-breaking.\n\nNext, physical attributes and living situation:\n- Height and weight: 6 feet 9 inches, 185 lbs - Average for height but within normal limits.\n- Living situation: Currently living alone - No specific risk indicators here.\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college - This might suggest some level of educational attainment but no direct risk factors.\n\nJob history:\n- Job history: Held 1 job during the year - Limited employment history could be a factor, but it's not clear-cut.\n\nSubstance use and mental health:\n- Substance use: Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years - This is a significant factor.\n- Mental health: Not felt depressed over the past month - No current depressive symptoms are reported.\n\nFamily background:\n- Family structure: Lived with both biological parents, household size 4 - No specific risk factors here.\n- Religious beliefs: God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally - This is a personal belief and does not directly impact risk assessment.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively influence the overall risk profile. The use of drugs in the past four years is a clear red flag, as it indicates potential substance abuse issues. Additionally, while the individual has been arrested but not convicted, this could suggest some level of involvement with law enforcement or legal issues.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. Substance use and arrest history are significant risk factors that need to be considered together. The combination of these factors suggests a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors and potentially facing legal consequences.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the provided risk factors indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
