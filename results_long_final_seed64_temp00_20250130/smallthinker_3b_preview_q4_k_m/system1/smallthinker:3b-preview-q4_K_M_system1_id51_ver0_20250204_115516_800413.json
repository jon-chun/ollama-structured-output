    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. This doesn't seem immediately alarming, but let me check if there are any other factors that could be relevant. Wait, what about her arrest history? She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. That's an important detail - it suggests some level of involvement with the justice system.\n\nLet me break down the risk factors further. The person is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs, which doesn't seem to indicate any physical health risks that I'm aware of. She has never been married and is currently living alone, but again, this doesn't necessarily suggest a high-risk profile on its own. Her education level - a high school diploma not enrolled in college - could potentially be a factor, as it might indicate some limitations in her life circumstances.\n\nNow, considering her employment history: she has held no jobs during the year. This is quite concerning, as it suggests a lack of financial stability and possibly a sense of disconnection from the workforce or society at large. Let me think about how this could impact her risk profile... Ah, yes, it's possible that unemployment could be linked to other issues, such as mental health problems.\n\nThe fact that she has not used any drugs in the past four years is a positive aspect, but let me consider the context of her feelings over the past month. She reports feeling so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up most of the time. This indicates significant emotional distress, which could be a critical factor in assessing her risk level.\n\nWait a minute... I should also take into account her living situation and family background. She has lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. This information might suggest some underlying issues or difficulties within her family dynamics that she hasn't been able to resolve. And then there's the aspect of her belief in God having something to do with what happens to her personally - this could be seen as a coping mechanism or a potential source of support, but it also raises questions about how she perceives and interacts with the world around her.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts so far: we have a young female with a troubled past, limited education, unemployment, significant emotional distress, and a unique family background. These factors individually might not indicate high risk, but when considered together, they suggest a complex situation that requires careful evaluation.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'm going to take a step back and consider the overall picture. The combination of her arrest history, lack of employment, emotional distress, and potentially troubled family dynamics does raise concerns about her ability to make responsible decisions or adapt to societal expectations. However, it's also important to remember that risk assessment is not just about predicting future behavior but also about understanding the context and potential underlying issues.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that while these factors do indicate some level of risk, they don't necessarily guarantee a high-risk profile in all contexts. Therefore, my prediction would be that these risk factors suggest a moderate to high risk scenario, depending on how one defines \"high\" in this context.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, the JSON object representing my response would be:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
