    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White, has been arrested twice, and has been convicted. He's also 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 190 lbs, which seems like average for his age group. Wait, let me check if these physical characteristics alone are enough to indicate high risk... No, they're not directly related to the risk factors.\n\nNext, I'll consider his criminal history: he's been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor, as it suggests a pattern of behavior that may put him at higher risk for future offenses. Let me think about this... If someone has been arrested multiple times, it could indicate a lack of respect for the law or a tendency to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life: he's never been married and is currently living alone. This doesn't seem directly related to risk factors either. However, I should note that being single might influence his decision-making or social interactions... But it's not clear how this would impact his likelihood of engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nMoving on, I'll look at his education and employment: he has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He also only holds one job during the year. These factors could potentially indicate a lack of stability or support in his life, which might increase his risk... But let me consider this further.\n\nThe fact that he's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana, is another significant factor. This suggests substance abuse issues, which are often linked to higher risk behaviors. Wait a minute... I should also consider the severity of these drug use patterns and how they might impact his decision-making or behavior.\n\nAdditionally, his history of living with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area, could provide insight into his social environment. Let me think about this... Growing up in a large household might have influenced his behavior or values, but it's not directly related to risk factors.\n\nFinally, I'll consider his personal beliefs: he doesn't believe that God has anything to do with what happens to him personally. This seems like an important factor, as it could indicate a lack of moral compass or respect for societal norms... But let me evaluate this further.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all these risk factors, I'm starting to form an opinion about the likelihood of high-risk behavior. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of his criminal history, substance abuse issues, and potential social influences does suggest that he may be at higher risk.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I predict that yes, this person indicates a high risk. My confidence in this prediction is 85%, considering all the factors weighed together.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
