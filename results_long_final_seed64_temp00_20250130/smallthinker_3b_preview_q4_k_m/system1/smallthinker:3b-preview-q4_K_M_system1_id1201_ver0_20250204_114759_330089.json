    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the arrest history. The person has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may be associated with criminal activity. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it suggests that there might be other factors at play, such as lack of legal representation or procedural issues.\n\nNext, her physical attributes are straightforward: 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 162 lbs. These details don't directly contribute to a high-risk profile but could be relevant in certain contexts, like employment or security screenings.\n\nHer educational background is also noteworthy. She has never been married and is currently not living alone, which suggests a certain level of independence. However, the lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate and her current status as not enrolled in college are significant risk factors. This indicates a potential gap in education that could lead to difficulties in finding stable employment.\n\nHer job history is another important factor. She has held 3 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of adaptability but also possibly a lack of long-term commitment or stability. This could be indicative of a high-risk profile due to her inability to secure and maintain consistent employment.\n\nThe use of drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is another significant risk factor. While it's not necessarily a guarantee of criminal behavior, it does suggest a pattern of substance use that could impact decision-making and potentially lead to involvement with law enforcement or other criminal activities.\n\nHer mental health status is also important. She has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she might be in relatively good mental health. However, this factor alone doesn't indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nThe living situation is another aspect to consider. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area at a young age. This could suggest exposure to certain environments or behaviors that might influence her risk profile. However, it's not directly indicative of criminal behavior.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is a personal statement that doesn't necessarily contribute to a high-risk profile but could be relevant in certain contexts, such as understanding motivations or decision-making processes.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. After considering all these factors, I realize that while some of the risk factors are significant, others are not directly linked to criminal behavior. However, given the combination of arrest history, lack of education, job instability, and substance use, it's reasonable to conclude that she may be at a higher risk.\n\nWait, let me check my reasoning again. Yes, I believe that while some factors mitigate against a high-risk profile, others suggest potential vulnerabilities that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
