    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his criminal history. The person has been arrested 7 times and convicted. This is a significant number of arrests and convictions, which suggests a pattern of illegal activities. Given this, I would rate his criminal history as high risk.\n\nNext, his age and physical attributes are relatively straightforward. At 21 years old, he's in the prime of his life, but his height and weight don't seem to indicate any significant health issues that could impact his behavior. So, I'll consider his physical attributes as low risk.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal background. He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, which is an urban area. This suggests he might have had some exposure to crime or violence at a young age. However, the fact that he considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally indicates a strong moral compass and possibly a belief in divine intervention. This could mitigate some of the negative influences from his environment.\n\nRegarding his education and employment history, he has a high school diploma and has held 2 jobs during the year. While this doesn't suggest any significant issues with education or employment, it does indicate that he might not have pursued higher education or more stable employment opportunities. This could be seen as a potential risk factor for future instability.\n\nHis substance use is another important aspect. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which is a clear indication of substance abuse. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that his mental health might not be significantly impacted by substance use.\n\nFinally, his personal beliefs and values are worth considering. His belief in God's influence on his life could provide him with a sense of purpose and direction, potentially reducing his risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given all these factors, I need to weigh them against each other to determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nWait a minute... While he has had some legal issues and has used drugs, the strong belief in God's influence and his relatively stable personal life might mitigate some of the negative aspects of his criminal history. However, the number of arrests and convictions is quite significant, and the substance use is also a clear risk factor.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I would say that while there are mitigating factors, the overall profile suggests a high-risk individual due to his extensive criminal record and substance use.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
