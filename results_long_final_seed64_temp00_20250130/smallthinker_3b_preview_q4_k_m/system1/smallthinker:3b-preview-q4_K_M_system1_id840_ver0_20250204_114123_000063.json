    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 18 years old - This is relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - No direct correlation to risk here.\n- Physical attributes: Height and weight are average. No significant indicators of risk.\n\nNext, let's look at the criminal history:\n- Arrested 3 times but not convicted - This is concerning, as it suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher likelihood of future offenses.\n- Employment history: Held 7 jobs in one year - Multiple job changes can be seen as a sign of instability or potential involvement with substance abuse.\n\nNow, let's examine the personal life:\n- Never married, currently not living alone - This could suggest a lack of support system and potentially increased vulnerability to negative influences.\n- Education level: High school diploma, not enrolled in college - Limited educational attainment can be associated with higher risk factors.\n- Substance use: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) - Regular drug use is a significant red flag for high-risk behavior.\n\nFinally, let's consider the life experiences:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area at a young age - This could indicate exposure to adverse childhood events.\n- Belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally - This suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The combination of frequent arrests, substance use, and limited life experiences does indeed suggest a high-risk profile. However, the belief in God's non-involvement complicates the assessment, as it may indicate a different perspective on personal responsibility.\n\nWait a minute... Given all these factors, I need to balance the information carefully. The strong indicators of risk outweigh the potential mitigating factor regarding faith.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that this profile indicates a high-risk situation.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 7 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
