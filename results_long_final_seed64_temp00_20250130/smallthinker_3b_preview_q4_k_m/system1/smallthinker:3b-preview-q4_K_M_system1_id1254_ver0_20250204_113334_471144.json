    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk for criminal behavior. Let me break down each factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 22 years old, he is in a vulnerable period where many young adults are still developing their identities and life paths. This could be a time of exploration and potential experimentation with different behaviors, including those that might lead to criminal activities. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a relatively minor offense, and without conviction, it suggests he may have acted impulsively or out of desperation rather than with premeditated intent. This factor seems to lean towards a lower risk profile.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight do not inherently suggest any criminal behavior. They could be relevant in certain contexts, but they don't directly correlate with risk levels.\n\nLiving situation is another important aspect. Currently living alone after never being married and having lived with adults other than biological parents at a young age. This suggests he may have experienced some instability in his early life, which could potentially influence his behavior. However, the fact that he has not been convicted of any serious offenses mitigates this risk.\n\nEducation level is also significant. Without a high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college, it indicates a lack of formal education and possibly limited opportunities for upward mobility. This could contribute to feelings of frustration and desperation, which might lead to criminal behavior. However, the absence of conviction further supports a lower risk profile.\n\nEmployment history is another critical factor. He has held no jobs during the year, which suggests unemployment or perhaps difficulty finding stable employment. This could be due to various reasons, including lack of skills, education, or experience. Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increased stress, potentially contributing to criminal behavior. However, again, the lack of conviction reduces this risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant concern. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and some time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates substance abuse and potential mental health issues, which are known risk factors for criminal behavior. However, the lack of conviction suggests that these actions may not have been driven by a desire to commit crimes.\n\nLastly, his belief in God's non-involvement with personal life is an interesting factor. It suggests he might be more independent and less reliant on external influences, which could reduce his risk profile. However, this belief does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together. While there are several risk factors present, the lack of conviction and the overall pattern of actions suggest that these behaviors may not have been driven by a desire to commit crimes. The instability in his early life could be a factor, but it is mitigated by his current situation and the absence of conviction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I conclude that while there are risk factors present, they do not indicate high risk for criminal behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
