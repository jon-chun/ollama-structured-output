    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the list of risk factors: \n- The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.\n- He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted.\n- He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 210 lbs.\n- He has never been married and is currently not living alone.\n- He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- He has held 1 job during the year.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.\n- At a young age, he lived in a household of size 6.\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me break this down. The fact that he's been arrested multiple times and convicted is a significant red flag. Wait, let me check if there are any other factors that could mitigate this risk... \n\nYes, it seems that his conviction history is quite severe. Now, considering his age and the number of arrests, I'm starting to think that this might indicate a pattern of behavior or a lack of respect for the law.\n\nLet me think about the other factors... He's 20 years old, which means he has a relatively short criminal history compared to some adults. However, the fact that he's been arrested multiple times and convicted is still quite alarming.\n\nNow, I'll consider his personal life. He hasn't been married, lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate, and hasn't held a job for more than a year. These factors suggest a lack of stability and support in his life, which could potentially contribute to his involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\nWait a minute... I just realized that he's also used drugs in the past four years. This is another significant risk factor. However, it's worth noting that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that he's not currently struggling with mental health issues.\n\nLet me think about his background... He lived in a household of size 6 at a young age, which could have influenced his behavior or values. And finally, his belief in God and its role in what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. It might suggest that he's seeking guidance or meaning in his life, but it also raises questions about how this faith influences his decision-making.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm starting to lean towards a conclusion. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of multiple arrests and convictions, the lack of stability in his personal life, and his history of drug use are all significant risk factors. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to conclude that yes, these risk factors do indicate high risk. My confidence level is 85%, which reflects my assessment of the severity and combination of these factors.\n\nHere's my final answer in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
