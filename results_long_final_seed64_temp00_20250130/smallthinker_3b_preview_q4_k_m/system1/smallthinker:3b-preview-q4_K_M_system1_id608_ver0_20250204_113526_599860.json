    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. This doesn't seem to be directly related to her risk level, so let me move on to other factors.\n\nWait, I just realized that she has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. This is a significant factor - it suggests that she may have a history of engaging in criminal behavior. Let me check if this is the only relevant factor... No, there are more.\n\nShe also has never been married and is currently living alone, which might indicate some level of independence or autonomy. However, I need to consider other aspects as well. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This could potentially be related to her risk level, as it may suggest limited education or job opportunities.\n\nLet me think about this for a moment... Limited education and employment history can indeed contribute to higher risk levels. But what about other factors? She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which is another significant concern. However, she has not felt depressed over the past month, so that's one factor less to consider.\n\nNow, I'll examine her living situation further. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age. This could potentially be related to her risk level, as it may indicate some level of family instability or dysfunction. But let me not jump to conclusions - I need to consider all the factors before making a decision.\n\nFinally, she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. While this is an interesting personal belief, it doesn't seem directly related to her risk level in terms of criminal behavior or substance use.\n\nWait a minute... Let me summarize my thoughts so far. The person's history of arrests and convictions, limited education and employment opportunities, drug use, and family background are all significant factors that could contribute to higher risk levels.\n\nNow, let me assign some confidence scores to each factor. For the arrest and conviction history, I'd say 80% - this is a clear indication of past criminal behavior. For the living situation, I'd say 60% - while it's an important factor, it may not be as directly related to risk as other factors. For education and employment, I'd say 70% - limited opportunities can contribute to higher risk levels. For drug use, I'd say 50% - she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. And for the personal belief about God's role in her life, I'd say 40% - this doesn't seem directly related to risk.\n\nLet me calculate the overall confidence level... It looks like it would be around 63%. This suggests that while there are some significant risk factors, they may not be as strongly correlated with high-risk behavior as other factors might suggest.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that the answer is YES. The person's history and background do indicate a higher risk level, but my confidence in this prediction is moderate - around 63%.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 63\n}",
