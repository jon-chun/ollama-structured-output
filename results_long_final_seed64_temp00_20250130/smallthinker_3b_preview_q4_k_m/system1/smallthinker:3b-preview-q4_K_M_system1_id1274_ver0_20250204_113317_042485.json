    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his age and ethnicity. The person is 21 years old and identifies as Hispanic. This doesn't immediately suggest any significant risk factors on its own, but it does provide some context about his background.\n\nNext, I'll consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This could be a red flag, as arrests can indicate potential criminal behavior. However, the lack of conviction suggests that he might have avoided serious charges so far. Let me think... this is a mixed signal and requires further consideration.\n\nNow, let's examine his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 202 lbs. These details don't directly relate to risk factors but could be relevant in certain contexts, such as employment or personal safety. I'll keep them in mind for now.\n\nMoving on to his living situation. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests a certain level of independence, which might indicate he can manage his own affairs without the support of a spouse. However, it also means he might be more vulnerable to social pressures or influences that could lead him into trouble.\n\nHis educational background is another important factor. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. This indicates some level of education and possibly a commitment to personal development. It's a positive sign but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nRegarding his employment history, he has held four jobs during the year. This suggests he can adapt and find work, which might indicate resilience or resourcefulness. However, it also means he could be easily influenced by economic pressures or social influences that might lead him into risky situations.\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) but has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests a pattern of drug use but no current mental health issues, which could be important for understanding his emotional state and potential risk-taking behaviors.\n\nLastly, his living situation at a young age and his belief in God's influence on personal life are significant. Living with adoptive parents in a large household might indicate some level of social support or challenges that he has faced. His belief in God could also provide a sense of purpose or moral guidance, which might mitigate against certain risky behaviors.\n\nLet me check the overall picture... The combination of his arrest history and substance use raises concerns about potential criminal behavior. However, his educational background and employment suggest resilience and adaptability. Additionally, his living situation and beliefs add layers that could either support or challenge these risks.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I conclude that while there are some risk factors present, the overall profile suggests a moderate level of risk rather than high risk. The arrest history and substance use are significant but not definitive indicators of criminal behavior. His educational background and employment suggest he can manage his life without relying on criminal activities.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
