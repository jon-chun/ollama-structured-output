    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Asian / Pacific Islander. This doesn't seem to be a significant factor on its own, but it might be relevant in certain contexts. Wait, let me check if there are any specific cultural or ethnic factors that could influence the risk assessment.\n\nNext, I'll consider the fact that he has been arrested 5 times but has not been convicted. This is a crucial piece of information - being arrested multiple times without conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that may be associated with higher risk. Let me think about this for a moment... If someone is arrested frequently, it could indicate a lack of respect for the law or a propensity to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical characteristics and living situation. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to the risk assessment. However, he has never been married and is currently living alone, which might suggest a lack of social support or a history of unstable relationships. Hmm, this could be an important factor - research suggests that individuals with limited social connections may be at higher risk for engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nMoving on, I'll examine his educational background and employment status. He has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, which might indicate a lack of education or career opportunities. Additionally, he has held no jobs during the year, which could suggest unemployment or difficulty finding employment. Let me think about this... Unemployment can be a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, as it may lead to financial instability and desperation.\n\nNow, let's consider his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is an important distinction - while drug use can be associated with higher risk, the absence of depression suggests that he may not be experiencing significant emotional distress.\n\nFinally, I'll look at his family background and personal beliefs. He has lived with his biological dad in a household of size 2, which might suggest a lack of parental guidance or support. However, he considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally, which could indicate a lack of moral values or accountability.\n\nWait a minute... Let me take a step back and consider all the factors I've analyzed so far. While there are some risk factors present, such as frequent arrests and limited social support, it's also important to note that he has not been convicted, has used drugs but not recently, and considers God irrelevant to his life. This suggests that while there may be some risk involved, it's not necessarily high.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that the overall risk level is moderate. Let me think about how to quantify this... I would say that the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 60%. This takes into account the various factors I've analyzed and weighs them against each other.\n\nHere's my final answer in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
