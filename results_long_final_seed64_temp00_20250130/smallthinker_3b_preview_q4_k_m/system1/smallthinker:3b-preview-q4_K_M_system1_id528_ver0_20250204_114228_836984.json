    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 5 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the frequency of these arrests - it seems quite high. This could be a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nNext, I'll consider their age and demographics. The individual is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Let me think about this for a moment... While being young and male can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, the specific combination of these factors doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own. However, it's essential to keep in mind that age and gender are not standalone indicators.\n\nNow, let's look at their physical characteristics. They are 5 feet 5 inches tall and weigh between 150 and 174 lbs. Hmm... these measurements don't seem particularly relevant to risk assessment on their own. I'll make a note to disregard them for now.\n\nMoving on, I'll analyze the person's personal life. They have never been married, are currently living alone, and hold a GED certificate with no college enrollment. Let me think about this... Living alone could potentially indicate a lack of social support, which might be relevant in certain contexts. However, it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nTheir employment history is also worth considering. They have held only 1 job during the year, which suggests limited work experience and possibly lower employability. Wait a minute... this could be an important factor in determining their potential for future involvement in criminal activities.\n\nNow, let's examine their substance use history. The individual has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Let me check the frequency of these uses... It seems that they have not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. However, I'll keep this information in mind as it relates to potential mental health concerns.\n\nThe person's background also includes living with their biological dad in a household of size 5 in an urban area at a young age. Let me think about this... Growing up in a large household and living with a father could potentially influence their life choices, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nFinally, I'll consider the individual's belief that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. Hmm... this seems like a personal faith statement rather than an indicator of high risk. However, I'll keep it in mind as it might be relevant in certain contexts or for specific types of assessments.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all these factors, I'm starting to form an opinion about the individual's risk level. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of their criminal history and limited social support could potentially indicate high risk. However, other factors like their age, physical characteristics, employment history, substance use, and personal background seem less directly relevant.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'm going to make a prediction about the individual's risk level. Let me think about my confidence in this prediction... Considering all the factors and how they interact, I believe that the individual does indeed indicate high risk. My confidence level is 85%.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
