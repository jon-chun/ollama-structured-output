    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black, has been arrested 3 times but not convicted, is 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighs 140 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, has held only 1 job during the year, has not used any drugs in the past four years, and has not felt depressed over the past month. Additionally, she has lived in a household of size 6 at a young age and considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me break down these factors one by one. The fact that she's been arrested 3 times but not convicted is concerning, as it suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate risk-taking or impulsivity. Wait, let me consider this further - while conviction history can be an indicator of risk, the lack thereof might also suggest that her actions have not led to severe consequences thus far.\n\nNext, I'll examine her educational background and employment status. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which could indicate limited opportunities for personal growth and development. However, she has held only 1 job during the year, which might suggest instability or lack of commitment to any one profession.\n\nNow, let's look at her living situation - currently living alone after having lived in a household of size 6 at a young age. This could imply some level of independence but also possibly a history of moving frequently, which might be related to the household dynamics she experienced earlier in life.\n\nThe fact that she hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month is quite positive, indicating no recent involvement with substances or mental health issues. This is an important factor to consider when assessing risk - a lack of substance use and mental health concerns generally suggests lower risk.\n\nConsidering her personal beliefs, that she considers God has something to do with what happens to her personally, this could be seen as a stabilizing influence in her life, potentially reducing the likelihood of impulsive or reckless behavior. However, it's also possible that such beliefs might not directly correlate with risk-taking behaviors, depending on how they are interpreted and practiced.\n\nLet me think about how all these factors combine... The combination of limited education, unemployment, frequent moves, and a history of arrest without conviction seems to paint a picture of someone who may be navigating life's challenges with some instability. Yet, the absence of recent substance use and mental health issues, along with her personal beliefs, suggests that she might have some resilience factors at play.\n\nWait a minute... Given all these considerations, it seems that while there are certainly risk factors present, they do not paint a picture of high-risk behavior. The lack of severe consequences from her arrests, the positive aspects of her life such as living alone and having personal beliefs that could be stabilizing, and the absence of recent substance use or mental health issues all contribute to a nuanced assessment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe it's reasonable to conclude that these risk factors do not indicate high risk. Therefore, my prediction is \"NO\", with a confidence level based on the analysis provided.\n\nHere is my final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
