    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential future actions. Given that he has a conviction record, it suggests a pattern of engaging in activities that lead to legal issues. This factor alone points towards a high-risk profile.\n\nNext, I'll consider his age and physical attributes. At 21 years old, he is within the typical range for criminal activity. His height and weight are average, so they don't seem to be contributing factors on their own. However, combined with his criminal history, they might indicate a level of aggression or strength that could influence his behavior.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life. He has never been married and is currently living alone. This suggests a lack of social support and possibly a higher risk tolerance. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation and a greater willingness to take risks. However, this factor alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk; it's more about the context.\n\nHis educational background is also noteworthy. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. This indicates an ongoing commitment to education and possibly a desire for personal growth. While this could be seen as a positive trait, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nRegarding his employment history, he has held only one job during the year. This might suggest instability or a lack of long-term commitment, which could be indicative of other issues such as substance abuse or mental health problems. However, since we already know about his drug use, this factor is somewhat redundant in terms of risk assessment.\n\nHis drug use history is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While marijuana use alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk, it does suggest a pattern of substance abuse that could be linked to other issues such as mental health or criminal behavior. This factor adds weight to the overall risk assessment.\n\nHis living situation and personal beliefs are also important. He has lived with his biological mother in a large household and considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally. These factors don't directly contribute to a high-risk profile but might indicate a sense of responsibility or a belief system that could influence his behavior.\n\nFinally, let's consider the overall pattern of these risk factors. The combination of criminal history, substance abuse, and living alone suggests a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Given this analysis, I can confidently say that the individual indicates a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
