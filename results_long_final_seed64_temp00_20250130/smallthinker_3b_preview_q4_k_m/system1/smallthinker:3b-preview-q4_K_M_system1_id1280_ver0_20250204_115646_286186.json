    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for an individual. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 22 years old - This is relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\n- Race/ethnicity: Black - There are no specific racial or ethnic biases in criminal justice that would automatically classify someone as high-risk based on race alone.\n\nNext, let's look at the legal history:\n- Arrested 1 time and convicted - This is a significant factor. Being arrested and convicted suggests some level of involvement with the legal system.\n- Current living situation: Living alone - No immediate red flags here.\n\nEducation and employment:\n- GED certificate - This indicates some level of education, which is generally positive.\n- Not enrolled in college - This could be seen as a lack of higher education aspirations, but it's not necessarily indicative of high risk.\n- Held 2 jobs during the year - Having multiple jobs can indicate stability or desperation, depending on the context.\n\nSubstance use:\n- Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) - Drug use is a significant factor. It suggests potential substance abuse issues.\n- Some time during the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up - This indicates emotional distress, which can be linked to mental health issues or other underlying problems.\n\nLastly, the living situation at a young age:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 8 - This suggests a potentially unstable home environment, which could have influenced behavior and life choices.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The combination of being arrested and convicted, drug use, emotional distress, and an unstable childhood environment all point towards a higher risk profile. However, the lack of ongoing criminal activity or violent offenses might mitigate some risks.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - the arrest and conviction are significant, but they could also be seen as a wake-up call for change. The drug use and emotional distress suggest underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors do indicate a high-risk profile. The combination of legal history, substance abuse, and emotional distress suggests a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior or involvement with the justice system.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
