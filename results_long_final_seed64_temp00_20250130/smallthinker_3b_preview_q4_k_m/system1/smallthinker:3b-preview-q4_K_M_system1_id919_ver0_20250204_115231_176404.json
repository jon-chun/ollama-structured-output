    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 19 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior and decision-making. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's important to note that he is still a minor at the time of the arrest. Conviction would be more indicative of a pattern of behavior leading to criminal activity.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward and do not seem to pose any significant risk factors on their own.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone after never being married, this suggests independence but also a lack of support network. This could potentially influence his decision-making process if he feels unsupported.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED certificate, and not enrolled in college. This indicates a lower educational attainment, which can be correlated with higher risk factors such as limited job opportunities and potential involvement in criminal activities.\n\nEmployment history: Holding two jobs during the year suggests some level of employment stability, but it also means he has had multiple roles, which could indicate instability or a lack of long-term commitment to any one employer. This is something that needs careful consideration.\n\nDrug use: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests some substance abuse history, but no current mental health issues. This factor alone does not necessarily indicate high risk, as it could be a one-time occurrence or part of his lifestyle.\n\nPast living situation: Living with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area. This provides context for his upbringing and potential influences from family dynamics, but it's important to consider that this is a specific period in his life and does not necessarily predict future behavior.\n\nBelief in God: Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of faith or moral compass, which could be a significant factor. This belief system can influence decision-making and ethical considerations.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While some factors suggest potential instability and limited support networks, others indicate a more stable life situation. The key here is to weigh the cumulative impact of these factors on his likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Given the mix of factors that could either contribute to or mitigate risk, I need to consider the overall picture. The arrest record, drug use history, and limited education are all indicators of potential instability and involvement with the legal system. However, the lack of conviction, stable employment, and current mental health status suggest a more nuanced situation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while there are risk factors present, they do not collectively indicate a high-risk profile for this individual. The arrest record is significant, but it's important to note that he has not been convicted. His education level and limited support network are also concerns, but his employment stability and current mental health status provide some balance.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
