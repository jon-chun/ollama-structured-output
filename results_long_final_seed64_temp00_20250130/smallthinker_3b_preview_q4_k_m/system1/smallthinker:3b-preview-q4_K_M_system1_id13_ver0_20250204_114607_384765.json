    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his demographic information:\n- Age: 20 years old (young adult)\n- Ethnicity: Asian / Pacific Islander\n- Height and weight: 5'10\" and 145 lbs\n\nThese details alone don't necessarily indicate a high-risk profile. However, they are part of the broader picture.\n\nNext, let's look at his criminal history:\n- Arrested once (convicted)\n- No jobs during the year\n- Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana)\n\nThese factors suggest some level of instability and potential substance use issues, which could be indicators of higher risk. But I need to consider them in context.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life:\n- Never married\n- Currently living alone\n- High school diploma\n- Enrolled in a 4-year college\n\nLiving alone and having no jobs might indicate some level of independence but also potential instability. The fact that he is enrolled in a 4-year college suggests an educational path, which could be positive.\n\nFinally, let's consider his past experiences:\n- Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4\n- Believes God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\n\nThe living situation might suggest some level of family support or instability. The belief that God is irrelevant could indicate a lack of moral compass, which is a significant risk factor.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given the combination of these factors, it seems there are both positive and negative indicators. However, the presence of criminal history, substance use, and potential instability in personal life suggests a higher risk profile.\n\nWait, let me break this down further. The key here is to weigh the positive (education) against the negative (criminal record, substance use). Given the context, I believe the negative factors outweigh the positive ones.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can confidently say that the individual in question indicates a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
