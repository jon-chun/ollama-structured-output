    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White, with no prior convictions but has used drugs in the past four years. She's also had multiple jobs and lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. Wait, let me break this down further - what does it mean for someone to have used drugs in the past four years? This could be a significant factor, as substance abuse can often lead to behavioral issues or even criminal activity.\n\nLet me check the specifics: she's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which is somewhat mitigating. However, her history of drug use and the fact that she felt so down in the dumps during the past month could indicate a higher risk of engaging in harmful behavior. I'm thinking... if someone feels this way, it might suggest underlying mental health issues or a lack of support system.\n\nNow, considering her educational background - she has a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. This suggests some level of maturity and possibly a stable financial situation, which could be protective factors against certain types of risk behavior. But, let me think about this more critically... while education can provide a foundation for responsible decision-making, it doesn't necessarily guarantee that someone won't engage in risky behaviors.\n\nHer living situation is also noteworthy: she's currently living alone after having lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. This transition could potentially lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection, which might contribute to her mental health struggles mentioned earlier.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area. This context is important because it can influence one's worldview and exposure to different social environments. Wait a minute... the fact that she considers God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally could indicate a certain level of skepticism or independence - but does this directly relate to risk factors? Let me consider this further.\n\nGiven all these factors, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge. The combination of substance use, feelings of despair, and the transition from living in a larger household to being alone could indeed suggest a higher risk profile. However, let me evaluate this more systematically... \n\nTo determine if these risk factors indicate high risk, I need to weigh each factor against what is typically considered indicative of such risk levels. Substance abuse, especially when combined with feelings of despair and isolation, can be particularly concerning. The transition from living in a larger household to being alone could exacerbate mental health issues, potentially leading to increased risk-taking behaviors.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that these factors do indeed suggest high risk. My confidence level in this assessment is based on the cumulative effect of substance use, feelings of despair, and the contextual factors provided - it's not just one or two factors, but a combination that paints a picture of significant vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, my analysis leads me to conclude that yes, these risk factors do indicate high risk. My confidence level in this conclusion is 85%.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
