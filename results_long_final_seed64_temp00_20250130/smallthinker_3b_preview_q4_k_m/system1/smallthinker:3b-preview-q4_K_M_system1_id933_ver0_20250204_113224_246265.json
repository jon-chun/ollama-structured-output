    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior and decision-making. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nNext, I'll look at his arrest record. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's important to note that he is still a minor and may be undergoing juvenile proceedings. Therefore, this factor alone does not strongly suggest high risk.\n\nNow, let's examine his physical attributes. Being 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighing 185 lbs indicates a healthy build, which generally does not correlate with criminal behavior. This factor also does not point towards high risk.\n\nMoving on to his personal life, he is currently living alone, has never been married, and does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. These factors suggest a certain level of independence and lack of formal education, but they do not necessarily indicate criminal intent.\n\nRegarding employment, he has held only one job during the year, which could be seen as a lack of stability. However, this alone does not suggest high risk behavior.\n\nHis drug use history is clean for the past four years, and he has not felt depressed over the past month. These factors are positive indicators that he is currently in good mental health and has no recent involvement with substance abuse or depression-related issues.\n\nThe most significant factor to consider is his upbringing. He lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5 at a young age. This suggests a potentially unstable home environment, which could have influenced his behavior and decision-making processes. However, it's important to note that this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This belief system is generally positive and does not suggest any inclination towards criminal activity.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While some of these factors are neutral or positive, others point towards a potentially unstable upbringing. Given the combination of his young age, lack of formal education, and potential instability in his home environment, I believe that these factors collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The key here is to consider the cumulative effect of these factors on an 18-year-old male who has not been convicted of any crime but has a history of instability and limited formal education. This suggests that while he may be at risk, it's important to note that his age and lack of conviction are mitigating factors.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the combination of these factors does indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
