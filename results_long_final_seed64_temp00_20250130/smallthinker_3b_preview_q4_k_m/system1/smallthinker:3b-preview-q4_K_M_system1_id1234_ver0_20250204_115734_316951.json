    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Black, arrested once but not convicted, with specific physical characteristics, living situation, education level, employment history, substance use, and personal beliefs. \n\nLet me break down each factor to assess its potential impact on risk assessment. The fact that she's a 22-year-old female could be relevant, especially considering the age and gender dynamics in criminal justice. However, I need more context about how these factors individually or collectively contribute to risk.\n\nWait, let me check the specifics of her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is an important distinction because conviction status can significantly influence risk assessment. But since she hasn't been convicted, it might suggest a lower likelihood of future criminal behavior, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, considering her physical characteristics and living situation - being 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 135 lbs, currently living alone, with no high school diploma or GED certificate. These details seem more related to socioeconomic status and personal background rather than direct indicators of criminal risk. However, they could be part of a broader profile that includes other factors.\n\nLet me think about her employment history. She has held two jobs during the year, which indicates some level of employability and possibly financial stability. This is generally seen as a positive factor in terms of reducing the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors associated with criminal activity.\n\nThe mention of past drug use - marijuana usage over the past four years, and recent feelings of depression that could be related to substance use - is concerning. Substance abuse can be a significant risk factor for involvement in criminal activities. However, I need to consider how these factors might interact with other aspects of her life and history.\n\nHer living situation as a young adult, having lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, could provide insight into family dynamics and support systems. This is an important aspect because social support can play a crucial role in preventing or mitigating criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally - this seems more related to personal beliefs and values rather than direct indicators of risk. However, it's essential to consider how such beliefs might influence decision-making processes, especially in the context of potential involvement in criminal activities.\n\nWait a minute... After carefully considering all these factors, I realize that while some aspects like substance use and living situation do indicate potential risks, others like her age, gender, and personal beliefs suggest a more nuanced picture. \n\nLet me summarize my thoughts: The combination of factors including substance abuse history and past arrests, but also the lack of conviction and other mitigating factors such as employment stability and social support, leads me to conclude that while there are risk factors present, they do not necessarily indicate high risk in all contexts.\n\nTherefore, based on this detailed analysis, my prediction would be that these risk factors do not strongly suggest a high-risk profile. \n\nHere is my refined answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
