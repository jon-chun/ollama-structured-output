    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant red flag. Conviction rates are typically lower among Asian/Pacific Islander males of this age group, so this factor alone suggests a higher risk profile.\n\nNext, I'll look at his educational background. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of formal education, which can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior. However, it's important to note that many individuals with similar backgrounds do not engage in criminal activity.\n\nNow, let's examine his employment history. He has held two jobs during the year, which suggests some level of stability and responsibility. This is a positive factor, as it indicates he can maintain employment without relying on criminal activities for income.\n\nMoving on to his personal life, he is married but currently living alone. This could indicate instability in his relationships or personal circumstances, which might contribute to his mental health issues. However, this factor alone does not necessarily suggest high risk.\n\nRegarding his mental health, the statement about feeling \"so down\" that nothing could cheer him up during some periods of the past month is concerning. It suggests he may be experiencing significant emotional distress, which can sometimes lead to impulsive or reckless behavior. This is a critical factor in assessing his risk profile.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its role in personal experiences is an interesting aspect. While this does not directly correlate with criminal activity, it could indicate a strong support system or potential vulnerabilities that need to be considered.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together. The combination of multiple arrests and convictions, lack of formal education, significant emotional distress, and the belief in God's role in personal experiences paints a complex picture. While he has held two jobs and does not seem to rely on criminal activities for income, his other factors suggest a higher risk profile.\n\nWait a minute... Let me summarize my thoughts. The combination of multiple arrests, lack of formal education, significant emotional distress, and the belief in God's role in personal experiences indicates a high-risk profile. However, it's important to note that this is not an absolute prediction but rather a probabilistic assessment based on these factors.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
