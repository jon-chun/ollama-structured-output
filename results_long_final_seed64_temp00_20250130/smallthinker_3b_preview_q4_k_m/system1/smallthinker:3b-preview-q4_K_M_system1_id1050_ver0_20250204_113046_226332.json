    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. This doesn't seem particularly alarming on its own, but it's essential to consider in the context of other factors. Wait, let me check if there are any specific cultural or ethnic risk factors associated with this population.\n\nNext, I'll look at his criminal history. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. This is a significant red flag, as repeated arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to further involvement in the justice system. Let me think about how this might impact my overall assessment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a connection between his criminal history and other risk factors.\n\nNow, let's consider his personal life. He is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 185 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to the risk assessment. However, he has never been married and is currently living alone, which might suggest some level of instability or lack of social support. Hmm, this could be an important factor to consider.\n\nMoving on to his education and employment history. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which indicates a lack of formal education and potential difficulties in finding stable employment. Additionally, he has held 5 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of job-hopping and possibly a lack of commitment to any one employer. Let me think about how this might impact his risk profile... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge.\n\nNow, let's examine his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which is concerning. Furthermore, he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up at some point during the past month, which suggests potential mental health issues. Wait a minute... I think I'm starting to see a connection between his substance use and mental health concerns.\n\nFinally, let's consider his family background. He lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6 when he was younger, which might suggest some level of family dysfunction or instability. And, interestingly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which could indicate a strong sense of spirituality or faith. Let me think about how this might impact my overall assessment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a more complete picture.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I believe that the combination of his criminal history, substance use, and mental health concerns, along with his lack of formal education and potential instability in his personal life, suggests a high risk profile. Let me check my reasoning one last time... Yes, I'm confident in my assessment.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
