    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 4 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the specifics of their conviction... Yes, it seems that they have a history of committing crimes, which could be a major risk factor.\n\nNext, I'll consider their age and physical characteristics. They are a 20-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic, standing at 5 feet 11 inches and weighing between 200 and 224 lbs. Let me think about how these factors might influence their behavior... Ah, yes, the fact that they have never been married and is currently living alone could indicate a lack of social support or stability in their life.\n\nNow, let's look at their educational background and employment history. They have a high school diploma and has held 2 jobs during the year, which suggests that they may not be fully engaged in education or career development. Hmm, this could be an important factor... I'll make a note to consider it further.\n\nIn addition, they have used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but have not felt depressed over the past month. Let me think about how this might impact their risk assessment... Ah, yes, while substance use is a significant risk factor, the lack of depression could indicate that they are currently coping with life's challenges in a relatively healthy way.\n\nNow, let's consider their family background and personal beliefs. They have lived with both of their biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area, which could provide some context for their upbringing and values. And, interestingly, they believe that God has something to do with what happens to them personally... This is a unique aspect of their background that I'll need to take into account.\n\nAs I weigh all these factors, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge. The combination of their criminal history, lack of social support, and limited educational and employment opportunities does suggest a higher risk profile. Wait, let me check my calculations... Yes, based on the severity and recency of their offenses, as well as other relevant factors, I believe that this person's risk level is indeed high.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've come to a conclusion. Let me summarize my findings in a clear and concise manner:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
