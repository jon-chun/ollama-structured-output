    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, is 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighs 135 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Additionally, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area and considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me break down these factors one by one. The fact that she's been arrested once is concerning, but since it hasn't led to conviction, it might not be as significant. Wait, let me check if there are any other indicators of risk related to this arrest... No, it seems the lack of conviction is a mitigating factor.\n\nNext, her age and living situation could potentially influence her behavior or social interactions. However, without more specific information about her current lifestyle or any known criminal activities, these factors alone don't seem to indicate high risk.\n\nHer educational background and employment status are also important. She's enrolled in college but hasn't held a job recently. This suggests she might be focused on education at the moment, which could be a positive sign. Let me think about this for a moment... Yes, being engaged in higher education often indicates a level of maturity and responsibility that might reduce the likelihood of high-risk behavior.\n\nThe use of drugs is another critical factor. Using marijuana and cocaine can be indicative of potential substance abuse issues. However, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month suggests that her mental health might not be severely impaired by these substances. This could mean that while there's a risk associated with drug use, it may not be as high-risk as other factors.\n\nThe mention of living in an urban area and having a household size of 2 is also relevant. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, but this person hasn't been involved in any criminal activities recently. Let me consider this... It seems that the specific location might not be as much of a risk factor for her as other factors.\n\nLastly, her belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences could indicate a strong support system or coping mechanism. This is generally positive but doesn't directly address the level of risk associated with her current situation.\n\nConsidering all these factors together... I'm starting to see that while there are some indicators of potential risk, such as drug use and past arrests, they seem somewhat mitigated by other aspects like education and a strong belief in God. Let me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Arrested once (not convicted): Mitigating factor.\n- Drug use: Potential risk, but not severe given the lack of depression.\n- Strong educational background: Positive sign.\n- Strong support system through faith: Reduces potential risk.\n\nGiven this analysis, I believe that while there are some risks associated with her situation, they do not indicate a high-risk profile. Therefore, my prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
