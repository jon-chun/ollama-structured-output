    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. This doesn't seem to be directly related to her risk level, so let me move on to other factors.\n\nWait, I just realized that she has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. This is a significant factor - it suggests that she may have a history of engaging in criminal behavior. Let me check if this is the only relevant factor... No, there are more.\n\nShe also lives with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This information might be useful for understanding her living situation and potential social support network. However, it doesn't directly indicate high risk either.\n\nLet me think about other factors that could contribute to high risk... Ah yes, the fact that she has never been married and is currently living alone. While this may not necessarily indicate high risk, it's an important aspect of her personal life that I should consider.\n\nNow, let's look at her educational background. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This could potentially be relevant, as higher education might provide more opportunities for positive development and social integration. However, it doesn't seem to directly indicate high risk.\n\nNext, I'll examine her employment history. She has held 2 jobs during the year, which suggests that she may have some level of work experience and financial stability. This is generally a good sign, as it indicates that she may be able to provide for herself and potentially contribute positively to society.\n\nWait a minute... The fact that she has not used any drugs in the past four years is also important. This suggests that she may be taking steps towards positive change and reducing her risk of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, there's another factor that I need to consider - the statement \"At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.\" While this information is useful for understanding her background, it doesn't directly indicate high risk either.\n\nLet me think about other factors that could contribute to high risk... Ah yes, the fact that she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up during some periods of the past month. This suggests that she may be experiencing emotional distress or mental health issues, which could potentially increase her risk of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's consider her personal beliefs and values. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. While this is an important aspect of her worldview, it doesn't directly indicate high risk either.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all these factors, I'm starting to form a conclusion about the person's risk level. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of factors including her arrest history, living situation, and emotional distress suggests that she may be at higher risk for engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nWait, let me check my reasoning one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything... Yes, I'm confident in my conclusion.\n\nBased on my analysis, I predict that the person is at high risk. My confidence level is 85%.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
