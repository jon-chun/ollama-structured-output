    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his arrest history. The person has been arrested 5 times but has not been convicted. This is significant because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may be associated with criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it suggests that these arrests might not necessarily lead to formal charges or convictions.\n\nNext, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 165 lbs. These details don't directly contribute to a high-risk profile but are important for other assessments like risk of violence.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests a certain level of independence and possibly a history of unstable relationships or living situations. However, this factor alone doesn't indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nMoving on to education and employment. The person does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Additionally, he has held no jobs during the year. These factors suggest a lack of formal education and recent unemployment, which could be indicators of instability and potential risk-taking behavior.\n\nNext, let's consider his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. The fact that he uses drugs suggests a pattern of substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor. However, the absence of depression indicates a lack of emotional distress, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nNow, let's look at his family background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. This information provides context about his upbringing and environment, but it doesn't directly contribute to a high-risk profile.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is an important factor. This suggests a lack of moral or ethical guidance, which could be a significant risk factor for engaging in criminal behavior without regard for consequences.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given the combination of these factors\u2014arrest history, substance use, lack of education and employment, and a belief that personal circumstances are not influenced by divine intervention\u2014it seems likely that this individual may pose a high risk to society.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The arrest history and substance use suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to criminal activity. The lack of formal education and recent unemployment indicate instability and potential for risky decision-making. The belief in personal destiny without divine influence suggests a lack of moral compass, which could exacerbate the risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these factors collectively indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
