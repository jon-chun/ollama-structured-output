    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black, with no prior convictions but has been arrested once. He's 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 180 lbs, lives alone, has a high school diploma, and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Additionally, he has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - what are the key risk factors here? We have limited criminal history, no prior convictions, but one arrest. The use of drugs is also noted, although it's marijuana, which might not be as severe as other drug types. Living with both biological parents and being in an urban area could indicate certain social dynamics.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific factors that stand out as high risk indicators. Ah, yes - the arrest without conviction, combined with the use of drugs, does raise some concerns about potential future criminal behavior. However, it's also important to consider the context and the individual's circumstances.\n\nNow, let's think about the confidence level in our assessment. Given the information provided, I would say that while there are some risk factors, they don't necessarily indicate a high-risk profile. The lack of prior convictions and the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently are positive signs.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm going to make my prediction. Based on the analysis of these risk factors, I believe they do not indicate high risk. My confidence level in this assessment is 60%.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
