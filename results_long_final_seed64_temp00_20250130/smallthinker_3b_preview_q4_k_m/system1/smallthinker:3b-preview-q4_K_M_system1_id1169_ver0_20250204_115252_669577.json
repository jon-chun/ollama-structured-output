    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black, has been arrested twice, and has been convicted. He's also 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, hasn't been married, lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate, hasn't held any jobs during the year, hasn't used drugs in the past four years, and has experienced feelings of depression. Additionally, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when he was younger and considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me break this down further - what does it mean for these factors to indicate high risk? It means I need to consider how each factor contributes to the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Wait, let me check the criteria for assessing risk... Ah yes, it's about evaluating the combination of these factors and their potential impact on an individual's propensity for crime.\n\nNow, considering his arrest history and conviction, this is a significant red flag. It suggests he has already engaged in some form of illegal activity, which could indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to further criminal actions. Let me think about how to quantify this... Given the severity of these offenses, I would rate this factor as high risk.\n\nNext, his lack of education and employment history is also concerning. This indicates potential difficulties in finding stable employment or maintaining a positive lifestyle, which could contribute to feelings of frustration or desperation that might lead to criminal behavior. Hmm, how should I weigh this against the arrest history? It seems like both factors are crucial, but the arrest history might have a more direct impact on risk.\n\nHis living situation and family background also play a role. Living with his biological mother in a large household at a young age could suggest difficulties in forming healthy relationships or coping with stress, which might influence his behavior later in life. And considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally... This is an interesting factor. It suggests he might have some form of spiritual belief system, but it's unclear how this directly relates to risk assessment.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts so far: the arrest history and conviction are significant, his lack of education and employment are concerning, his living situation and family background suggest potential difficulties in forming healthy relationships or coping with stress, and his spiritual beliefs might influence his behavior. Wait a minute... How do I combine these factors to determine if they indicate high risk? It seems like each factor contributes to the overall risk profile.\n\nGiven all this information, I'm going to take a step back and consider the weight of these factors together. The arrest history is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which could suggest a pattern of future criminal actions. The lack of education and employment, combined with his living situation and family background, further support the idea that he might be at risk due to difficulties in finding stable employment or maintaining a positive lifestyle.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe they collectively indicate high risk. Let me think about how to express this in terms of confidence... Given the severity of the arrest history and conviction, as well as the other factors like his lack of education and employment, I would rate my confidence level as 85%. This is because while there are mitigating factors such as his spiritual beliefs and the fact that he hasn't used drugs in the past four years or felt so down in the dumps during the past month, these do not outweigh the significant risk posed by his arrest history and conviction.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
