    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background. They are a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. This information alone doesn't seem particularly alarming, but it's essential to consider in the context of other factors. Wait, let me check if there are any specific cultural or ethnic risk factors associated with this individual.\n\nNext, I'll look at their criminal history. They have been arrested 8 times and have been convicted. This is a significant red flag, as repeated arrests and convictions often indicate a pattern of behavior that may be linked to substance abuse, mental health issues, or other underlying problems. Let me think about how this might impact my assessment... Ah, yes, the fact that they've been convicted suggests that their actions have already resulted in legal consequences, which could be an indicator of high risk.\n\nNow, let's consider their personal life. They are currently living alone and do not have a spouse or dependents. This seems relatively neutral, but it's worth noting that having no family responsibilities might allow them to focus more on their own issues without the pressure of caring for others. However, I should also think about how this might affect their behavior... Hmm, it's possible that living alone could lead to increased isolation and a lack of social support, which could exacerbate any underlying problems.\n\nMoving on to their education and employment status. They have never been married, do not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, and are not enrolled in college. Additionally, they have held no jobs during the year. This suggests that they may be at risk of being unemployed and potentially without a clear direction in life. Let me think about how this might contribute to their overall risk profile... Ah, yes, the lack of education and employment could indicate a sense of disconnection from society and possibly an increased likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\nTheir substance use is also a critical factor. They have used drugs in the past four years, with marijuana being the primary substance, and most of the time during the past month they have felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer them up. This indicates a history of drug use and current mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for criminal behavior. Wait a minute... The combination of repeated arrests, convictions, lack of education and employment, substance abuse, and current mental health struggles suggests a complex set of risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I'm starting to see a pattern that indicates high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... The person's background, criminal history, personal life, educational status, employment situation, and substance use all point towards a significant risk profile. It seems clear that this individual is at high risk of engaging in further criminal behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I predict that the given risk factors do indicate high risk. My confidence level in this prediction is 95%, as it's supported by a comprehensive review of all the provided information and its implications.\n\nHere is my final answer in the required JSON format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
