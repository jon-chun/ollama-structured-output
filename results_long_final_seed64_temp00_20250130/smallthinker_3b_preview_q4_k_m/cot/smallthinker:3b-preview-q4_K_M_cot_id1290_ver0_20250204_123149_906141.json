    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 22 years old, she is relatively young, which might suggest a higher potential for recidivism due to less life experience. However, I need to balance this with the fact that she has not been convicted yet. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm considering all relevant factors.\n\nNext, her arrest history: she has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might be seen as less severe than an actual conviction. Let me think about how to weight this appropriately.\n\nHer physical attributes are straightforward and don't seem to directly impact her risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign a low weight to these factors.\n\nNow, let's consider her living situation: she is currently living alone. This might suggest some level of independence, which could be positive or negative depending on the context. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nHer educational background and employment history are also important. She has a high school diploma and has held three jobs during the year. These factors suggest stability and a commitment to work, which could mitigate her risk of recidivism. However, I need to consider how these might interact with other factors.\n\nThe drug use factor is straightforward: she hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. This is positive and should be weighted accordingly.\n\nHer history of living in a household of size 2 at a young age could indicate some level of resilience or adaptability, which might reduce her risk of recidivism. Let me think about how to balance this with other factors.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally is an interesting factor. This could suggest a strong sense of moral compass and potential for positive change, but it's also somewhat vague and difficult to quantify. I'll need to consider this carefully.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Age: low\n- Gender: low\n- Arrest history: medium (since she hasn't been convicted)\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Living situation: low\n- Education: low\n- Employment: medium (given her job history)\n- Drug use: low\n- Household size: low\n- Belief in God's influence: low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction. Given the mix of positive and negative factors, I'll predict a 50% chance of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old female\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Black identity\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest, not convicted\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"5'5\" height and 158 lbs weight\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"currently living alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma, not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"held 3 jobs during the year\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"lived in household of size 2 at a young age\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.
