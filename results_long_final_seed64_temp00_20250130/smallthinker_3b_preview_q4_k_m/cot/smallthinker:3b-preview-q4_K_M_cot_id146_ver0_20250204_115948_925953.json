    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old female who has been arrested twice, convicted, and uses drugs. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that she has already had two run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me think about this carefully... Arrests are a strong indicator of future criminal activity, especially when combined with convictions. So, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, her conviction history is another critical factor. She has been convicted twice. This indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me check the instruction again... Convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal activity. Therefore, I will also assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider her drug use. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This is another significant factor. Drug use can lead to increased risk-taking behavior and potential involvement in illegal activities. Let me think about this... Given that she has been using drugs recently, it suggests a higher likelihood of future criminal activity. So, I will assign this factor a high weight.\n\nHer age at the time of arrest is also important. She was arrested at a young age (19 years old). This may indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to further legal issues. Let me check the instruction again... Being arrested at a younger age can suggest a higher risk of recidivism due to less mature decision-making. Therefore, I will assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHer household size is another factor. She lived in a household with three people at a young age. This may indicate a lack of parental supervision and potential exposure to negative influences. Let me think about this... Living in a larger household can sometimes lead to more freedom and less supervision, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior. So, I will assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHer education level is also important. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This may indicate limited life skills and potential difficulties in finding employment. Let me check the instruction again... Limited education can sometimes lead to higher unemployment rates and increased risk of criminal activity. Therefore, I will assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHer job history is another significant factor. She has held five jobs during the year. This suggests she may have difficulty maintaining stable employment due to her past criminal behavior. Let me think about this... Multiple job changes can indicate instability and potential for further legal issues. So, I will assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nFinally, her personal beliefs are important. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This may indicate a strong sense of morality and potential for self-regulation. Let me check the instruction again... Strong religious beliefs can sometimes lead to a higher level of moral responsibility and less likelihood of future criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction. Given the high weights from arrest history, conviction history, and drug use, along with medium weights for household size, education level, job history, and personal beliefs, it seems likely that she may be at risk of recidivism. Therefore, I will assign this factor a low weight.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal activity, especially when combined with arrests.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can lead to increased risk-taking behavior and potential involvement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"age_at_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Being arrested at a young age may indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger household may have led to less supervision and potential exposure to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education can sometimes lead to higher unemployment rates and increased risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple job changes suggest instability and potential for further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Strong religious beliefs may indicate a strong sense of morality and potential for self-regulation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
