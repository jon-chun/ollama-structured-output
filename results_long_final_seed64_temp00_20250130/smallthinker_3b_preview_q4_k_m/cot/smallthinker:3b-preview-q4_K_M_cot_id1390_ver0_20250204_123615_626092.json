    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested five times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Given this pattern, I would classify this as a high-risk factor. Let me think about the reasoning behind this classification. The frequency and conviction rate suggest a propensity for repeat offenses, which aligns with a high risk.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 20 years old, he is still in his teenage years, which can be a critical period for criminal behavior. However, I need to consider other factors as well. Let me check the instruction again. The age factor alone doesn't seem to significantly impact the recidivism rate beyond what's already indicated by his arrest history and conviction record. Therefore, I would classify this as a medium-risk factor.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. These characteristics don't directly correlate with criminal behavior in the same way that arrest history does. However, they might influence how he interacts with law enforcement or the severity of potential offenses. Given this, I would classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nHis educational background is another important factor. He has never been married and is currently living alone, which doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior. His lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate might suggest some level of education deficit, but it's not a direct indicator of criminal propensity. Therefore, I would classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nHis employment history is also noteworthy. He has held only one job during the year, which could indicate unemployment or limited work experience. This might suggest a lack of stability and possibly an increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to support himself. However, it's not a direct indicator of recidivism. Therefore, I would classify this as a medium-risk factor.\n\nHis substance use history is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. This suggests that he might be less likely to engage in criminal activities related to drug use. Therefore, I would classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nHis mental health status is also important. He has not felt depressed over the past month, which indicates that he might be in relatively good mental health. However, depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so it's an important factor to consider. Given his current state of well-being, I would classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nHis family background is another significant factor. He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, which might suggest some level of familial influence on his behavior. However, the specific details about his upbringing don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I would classify this as a medium-risk factor.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is an important factor. This suggests that he might not be influenced by religious or moral considerations in his decision-making process. Given this, I would classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Based on the analysis of these factors, it seems likely that he will engage in criminal behavior within the next three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES.\"\n\nFor the confidence level, I would assign a 60% confidence score based on the cumulative weight of the risk factors.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested five times and convicted, indicating a pattern of repeat offenses.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"While age can be a factor in criminal behavior, it does not directly correlate with recidivism rates beyond what is already indicated by arrest history and conviction record.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate does not directly indicate a propensity for repeat offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can be a factor in criminal behavior, but it is not a direct indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use indicates a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities related to drug use.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Current mental health status does not directly correlate with recidivism rates beyond what is already indicated by other factors.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of size 3 may suggest some level of familial influence, but it is not a direct indicator of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
