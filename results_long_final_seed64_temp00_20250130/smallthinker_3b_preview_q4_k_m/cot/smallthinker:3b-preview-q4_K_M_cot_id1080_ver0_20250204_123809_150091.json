    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has already had two run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Therefore, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his conviction history. He has been convicted twice. This is another strong indicator of potential recidivism. The fact that he has already been convicted once makes it more likely that he will be arrested again within the next three years. So, I'll also assign this a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his age and gender. Being 21 years old and male may influence his risk factors. However, these are not directly related to recidivism in the same way as arrest history or conviction history. Therefore, I would assign these factors low weights.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism based on the information provided. So, I'll also assign these factors low weights.\n\nLiving alone is another factor. Living alone may influence his behavior, but it's not directly related to recidivism. Thus, I'll assign this a low weight as well.\n\nHis education level and employment status are important. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which suggests he is likely to continue his education. However, he has held only one job during the year, which may indicate instability. Given that he is currently living alone and has never been married, this factor would be assigned a medium weight.\n\nHis substance use history is another important factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that his drug use may not be directly related to recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size 7 is another factor. Living in a large household may influence behavior, but it's not directly related to recidivism. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. This suggests he may have a strong moral compass and values. However, it's not directly related to recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight as well.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been convicted twice, suggesting a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are not directly related to recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not influence recidivism based on the provided information.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may influence behavior, but it is not a direct indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"The person has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, suggesting a higher likelihood of continued education and potentially better life choices.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"The person has held only one job during the year, indicating potential instability and possibly a higher risk of unemployment or underemployment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but not felt depressed over the past month.
