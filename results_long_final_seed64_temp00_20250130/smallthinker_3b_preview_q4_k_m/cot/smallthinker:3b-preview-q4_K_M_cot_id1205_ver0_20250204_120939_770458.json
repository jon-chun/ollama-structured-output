    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a mistake or an isolated event. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, I'll look at her physical attributes. She's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 160 lbs. These details don't seem to directly impact her risk of recidivism in terms of physical capabilities or vulnerabilities. So, I would rate this as low.\n\nNow, let's consider her living situation. She lives alone, which might suggest a certain level of independence but also potentially isolation. This could be a factor, but it's not clear-cut. Let me think about this more deeply.\n\nHer educational background is another important factor. She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she hasn't pursued higher education, which might indicate some limitations in her life choices. However, it doesn't necessarily correlate with recidivism risk. So, I would rate this as low.\n\nHer employment history is also noteworthy. She has held no jobs during the year. This could be a significant factor because unemployment can sometimes lead to increased risk-taking behaviors or financial stress. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nHer substance use and mental health are critical factors. She hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These positive indicators suggest she's not currently at high risk for substance abuse or depression-related issues. So, I would rate these as low.\n\nNow, let's consider her family background. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 when she was young. This could be an important factor because growing up in a small household might have influenced her life choices and behaviors. Let me think about this more deeply.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is another significant factor. This suggests she might not seek help or guidance from religious institutions, which could impact her access to support services. So, I would rate this as medium.\n\nLet's summarize the risk factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: low\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Living situation: low\n- Educational background: low\n- Employment history: high\n- Substance use and mental health: low\n- Family background: medium\n- Belief in God's influence: medium\n\nNow, let's predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. Given her positive indicators for substance use and mental health, as well as her lack of employment and potentially unstable family environment, I would rate this as high.\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level based on the analysis. Considering all factors, I would rate the confidence at medium-high.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly impact risk of recidivism in terms of physical capabilities or vulnerabilities.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest some level of independence, but it doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment do not directly correlate with recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year may indicate unemployment or lack of employment opportunities, which could be a factor in increased risk-taking behaviors or financial stress.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_and_mental_health\", \"low\", \"No drug use and no depression over the past month are positive indicators for lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with biological mother in a small household may have influenced life choices, but it's not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has nothing to do with personal issues may limit access to support services or counseling.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
