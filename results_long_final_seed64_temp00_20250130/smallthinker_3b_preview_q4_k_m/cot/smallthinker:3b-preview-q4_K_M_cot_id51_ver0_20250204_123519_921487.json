    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested three times but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested three times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, I'll assign this a medium weight. Let me think about this more carefully - the fact that she's been arrested multiple times suggests a higher risk, but the lack of conviction means there might be mitigating factors at play.\n\nNext, her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in a critical period of development. Being female can sometimes influence how risks are perceived by the justice system, but it's not a direct indicator of future behavior. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHer physical attributes - height and weight - don't seem to directly correlate with criminal risk. They're more about personal characteristics that aren't predictive of future behavior. Therefore, I'll also assign this a low weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. She's never been married and lives alone. This could indicate independence or other factors, but it doesn't directly relate to her likelihood of reoffending. So, I'll assign this a low weight as well.\n\nEducation level - she has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While education can be a factor in predicting future behavior, it's not a direct indicator here. Thus, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nEmployment history is also important. She hasn't held any jobs during the year. This could suggest unemployment or other issues that might lead to criminal activity. However, it's not a definitive predictor. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHer substance use - she has not used drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates mental health issues, which can be a significant risk factor for reoffending. So, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nHer living situation - she lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 at a young age. This suggests a potentially unstable environment, which could influence behavior. However, it's not directly predictive of future criminal activity. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nLastly, her belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences - she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is more about her worldview and less about direct risk factors for reoffending. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the medium weights for arrest history, employment, and living situation, and high weight for mental health issues, I'll predict a 60% chance of rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested three times but not convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are not direct indicators of future risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never been married and living alone does not indicate a higher risk for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment are not direct predictors of future behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed during the year may suggest unemployment or other issues that could lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Hasn't used drugs in four years, but recent feelings of depression indicate potential mental health issues that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents at a young age may suggest an unstable environment, but it's not directly predictive of future risk.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences is more about worldview than direct risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
