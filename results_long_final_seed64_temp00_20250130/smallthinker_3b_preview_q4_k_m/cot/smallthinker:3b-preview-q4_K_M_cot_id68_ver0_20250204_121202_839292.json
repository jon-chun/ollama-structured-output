    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 20 years old, she is still in her early twenties, which means she has some time to grow and change. However, being female might influence how judges perceive her risk level. I'll assign this a medium weight because while age can mitigate risk, gender may still play a role.\n\nNext, the conviction itself is a significant factor. It indicates that she has already engaged in criminal behavior once. This suggests a higher risk of reoffending. Therefore, I'll give this a high weight.\n\nHer physical attributes are straightforward. Being 5 feet 5 inches and weighing 130 lbs doesn't directly impact her risk level, so I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nLiving alone is another factor. Living with family can provide support systems that might help mitigate criminal behavior. Since she lives alone, this could be seen as a medium risk factor because it means she has less external support.\n\nHer education and employment status are also important. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Additionally, she has held three jobs during the year but has used drugs in the past four years. This suggests instability and potential substance abuse issues, which I'll assign a medium weight.\n\nHer history of living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 is another factor. This could indicate family dynamics that might influence her behavior. However, since it's from her childhood, its impact on current risk levels may be less significant. So, I'll give this a low weight.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability. This is a significant factor because it indicates a potential disregard for societal norms and laws. Therefore, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the prediction. Given these factors, she does pose a moderate risk of reoffending within three years. So, my prediction will be \"YES.\"\n\nFinally, I need to determine the confidence level. Based on the analysis, I'm fairly confident in this assessment. Therefore, my confidence level is 80.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, she is still in her early twenties, which means she has some time to grow and change.\"),\n    (\"convicted\", \"high\", \"She has already been convicted of a crime once, indicating a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Her physical attributes do not directly impact her risk level, but being 5 feet 5 inches tall is within the average range.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less external support and potentially more vulnerability to peer pressure or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED certificate suggests limited education and potential instability in life.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability, but also possibly unstable living situation.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 may indicate family dynamics that could influence behavior, but this is from her childhood and may not directly impact current risk levels.\"),\n    (\"moral_viewpoint\", \"high\", \"Her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
