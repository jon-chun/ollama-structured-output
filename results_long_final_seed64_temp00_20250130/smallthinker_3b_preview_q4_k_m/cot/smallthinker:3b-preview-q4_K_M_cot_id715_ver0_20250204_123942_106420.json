    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, the risk might be lower than if she had been convicted multiple times. Let me check the scale again - low, medium, or high? Given this context, I would assign \"medium\" to her arrest history.\n\nNext, let's look at her age and gender. She is 18 years old and identifies as White. These factors are generally considered neutral in terms of risk assessment. There's no specific data suggesting that being a young female White person increases or decreases the likelihood of recidivism. So, I'll assign \"low\" to both age and gender.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes. She is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. These details don't directly impact risk assessment in a criminal context. They might be relevant for other types of assessments, but they don't seem pertinent here. So, I'll assign \"low\" to both height and weight.\n\nLiving situation is another factor. She lives alone, currently, and has never been married. This suggests she might have some independence, which could potentially reduce the risk of recidivism. However, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll assign \"low\" to living situation.\n\nEducation level is also important. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates she might be at a disadvantage academically, but it doesn't necessarily mean she's more likely to commit crimes. So, I'll assign \"medium\" to education level.\n\nEmployment history shows that she has held 5 jobs during the year. This suggests some level of employment stability and possibly financial independence. However, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll assign \"low\" to employment history.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This could indicate substance abuse issues, which might be related to higher recidivism rates. So, I'll assign \"high\" to drug use.\n\nDepression is another factor. She has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests she might be less likely to engage in criminal behavior due to a lack of emotional distress. Therefore, I'll assign \"low\" to depression.\n\nLastly, her upbringing and personal beliefs are important. She lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in a rural area at a young age. Additionally, she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. These factors might indicate a strong moral compass or a belief system that could influence her behavior. However, they don't directly correlate with criminal activity. So, I'll assign \"low\" to upbringing and personal beliefs.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk assessment. Given the factors above, it seems there is a moderate level of risk for recidivism. The arrest history and drug use are significant concerns, while other factors suggest she might be less likely to engage in criminal behavior due to her living situation and education level.\n\nLet me summarize this in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk due to two arrests but no conviction.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is generally not a significant factor in recidivism assessment.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender is typically considered neutral in recidivism assessments.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height does not directly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not directly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest independence, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may indicate disadvantage but not necessarily higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Multiple jobs may suggest stability and financial independence.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant concern for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Upbringing and personal beliefs do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
