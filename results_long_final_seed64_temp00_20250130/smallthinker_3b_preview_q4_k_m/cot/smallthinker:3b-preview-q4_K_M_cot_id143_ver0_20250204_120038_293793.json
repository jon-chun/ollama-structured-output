    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her age and gender. She is 22 years old and identifies as White. Age can be a factor in recidivism, but it's not always directly correlated with risk levels. Gender can also play a role, but in the context of criminal behavior, it's often more about societal expectations than individual characteristics. Let me check if there are any specific studies or data that might influence this.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014are relatively standard and don't seem to pose any significant risks. Living situation is another factor. She lives alone, which might indicate a certain level of independence but could also suggest a lack of support network. This needs careful consideration.\n\nEducation and employment history are crucial. She has completed a Bachelor's degree and has held four jobs during the year. These factors can influence recidivism by showing her ability to adapt and potentially find stable employment, which is generally protective against reoffending. Let me think about how these might interact with other risk factors.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. This suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could be linked to criminal behavior. Additionally, her recent feelings of depression are concerning and may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to risky behaviors. Let me consider how these might impact her risk level.\n\nHer childhood living situation is also important. She lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area at a young age. This suggests a potentially unstable environment, which could have influenced her behavior and resilience. However, it's essential to remember that correlation does not imply causation.\n\nFinally, her belief about God has no relevance to personal experiences is straightforward. It doesn't directly impact her risk level but might influence how she perceives the legal system or societal expectations.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Arrest history: medium\n- Age and gender: low\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Living situation: medium\n- Education and employment: high\n- Drug use: high\n- Childhood living situation: medium\n- Belief about God: low\n\nNow, let's put this together in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, but it is not necessarily indicative of high risk.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not significant factors in predicting recidivism, unless there is a specific pattern or correlation observed in the data.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight do not typically influence recidivism rates, unless there are underlying health conditions that affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but could also suggest a lack of support network, which might be relevant in certain contexts.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"high\", \"Higher education and stable employment can often serve as protective factors against recidivism, indicating a lower risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism, suggesting a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban household at a young age may indicate some level of instability but does not necessarily predict high risk without further context.\"),\n    (\"belief_about_god\", \"low\", \"Belief about God has no direct relevance to personal experiences and is therefore unlikely to influence recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
