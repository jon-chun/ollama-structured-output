    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for an 18-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting future criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it might indicate that the arrest was more of an isolated incident rather than a pattern of behavior. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, I'll look at his age and physical attributes. At 5 feet 9 inches and weighing 230 lbs, these are average measurements for someone in their late teens to early twenties. There's no indication that these factors contribute significantly to criminal risk beyond what is typical for young adults. So, I would rate this factor as low.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational background. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests he might have some basic education but lacks higher-level learning or vocational training. However, there's no direct link to criminal behavior here. So, I'll also rate this as low.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents at a young age is another factor. The household size was 2, and it was in a rural area. This could potentially influence his social environment and family dynamics. Let me think about this more deeply. Living with multiple adults can provide different influences compared to living with just one parent. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis job history is also important. He has held only 1 job during the year. This might suggest instability or a lack of commitment to employment. However, there's no direct link to criminal behavior here. So, I'll rate this as low.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is another factor. Using drugs can be a risk factor for criminal activity, but it's not necessarily indicative of future behavior. Let me think about this carefully. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month might suggest some level of mental health stability. So, I'll rate this as low.\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences is an interesting factor. This could potentially influence his moral compass or sense of responsibility. However, there's no direct link to criminal behavior here. So, I'll rate this as low.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction based on the collective analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, which may indicate a pattern of isolated incidents rather than a significant risk for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age and Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"The individual's age and physical attributes are within the typical range for young adults, with no direct link to increased risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"The person has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college, which may suggest some level of education but also indicates a lack of higher-level learning or vocational training.

However, there's no direct link to increased risk of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
