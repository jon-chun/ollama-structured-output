    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested five times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior. Given this pattern, I would classify this as \"high\" risk.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is in a prime age range for criminal activity. Being male also increases the likelihood of involvement in crime. So, I'll assign this factor an \"medium\" weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. While these factors don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, they might influence how he interacts with the law. I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nHis marital status is another factor. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests a certain level of independence that could either contribute to or mitigate criminal behavior. I'll assign this an \"medium\" weight.\n\nEducation is also important. He has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. While education can be a protective factor, his current situation might indicate a lack of structured learning environment. So, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held only one job during the year. This could suggest instability and possibly a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to support himself. Therefore, I'll assign this an \"medium\" weight.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While not all drug users turn to crime, this behavior does increase the risk of involvement in illegal activities. So, I'll classify this as \"high.\"\n\nDepression is a significant factor that could lead someone to engage in criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which reduces this risk. Thus, I'll assign this an \"low\" weight.\n\nHis living situation and family background are also important. He lived with his biological dad in a household of size 5 when he was young. This could indicate a lack of stability and possibly exposure to negative influences. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nLastly, his belief in God might influence his decision-making process. While faith can be a protective factor, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll assign this an \"low\" weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Age and gender: medium\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status: medium\n- Education: low\n- Employment: medium\n- Drug use: high\n- Depression: low\n- Living situation and family background: medium\n- Belief in God: low\n\nGiven these weights, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism of \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Past five arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Young age (21) and male gender increase the likelihood of involvement in crime.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Tall height and weight range do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living alone may indicate independence but also potential for instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED certificate without college enrollment suggests limited structured learning environment.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year indicates possible unemployment and financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana use increases risk of involvement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month reduces likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_and_family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological dad in a large household, potentially exposed to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
