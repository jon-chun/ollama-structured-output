    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut female who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which means she might be more susceptible to impulsive behavior due to hormonal changes and peer pressure. This factor seems to warrant a medium weight because while it's significant, it's not as critical as other factors like substance use or criminal history.\n\nNext, I'll look at her arrest record. She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. This is a concerning factor because even though she hasn't been convicted, the fact that she has been arrested twice suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher risk of future offenses. Given this, I would assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes and living situation. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to her criminal risk assessment. Additionally, she lives with her spouse and has a young family, which might provide some support but also potentially create stressors that could influence her behavior. This factor seems to have a low weight because it's not directly related to her criminal history or substance use.\n\nHer educational background is another important factor. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she may lack the education and skills necessary for stable employment, which could lead to increased involvement with law enforcement due to poverty or other issues. Given this, I would assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nHer job history is also relevant. She has held only one job during the year, which might indicate unemployment or instability. This factor seems to have a low weight because while it's concerning, it's not as directly related to her criminal behavior as other factors like substance use or arrest record.\n\nSubstance use is a critical factor in this assessment. She has used drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This suggests she may be struggling with mental health issues, which could influence her behavior and increase her risk of future offenses. Given this, I would assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, her personal beliefs and life experiences are important. She considers God to have something to do with what happens to her personally, which might indicate a strong sense of spirituality or faith. This factor seems to have a low weight because it's not directly related to her criminal behavior but could potentially influence her decision-making in the future.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19-year-old female, still in teenage years\"),\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"high\", \"2 arrests, not convicted, suggests pattern of behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"tall and heavy, no direct relation to criminal risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"no diploma or GED, potential for unstable employment\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"only one job during the year, potentially unstable\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"used drugs in past 4 years, mental health concerns\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"strong sense of spirituality, no direct relation to criminal risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
