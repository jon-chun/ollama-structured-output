    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about how to weight this.\n\nNext, her age and gender. She's 20 years old and identifies as White. Age is a factor in recidivism, but it's not directly correlated with risk levels. Gender can also play a role, but in the context of criminal behavior, it's often less significant than other factors like education and employment history. Let me check if there are any specific guidelines for these.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014are generally not considered significant risk factors in recidivism assessments. So, I'll assign them a low weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. She hasn't been married and lives alone. This might suggest independence or a lack of familial support, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior. Let me think about how this fits into the overall picture.\n\nLiving situation\u2014currently living alone\u2014is similar to marital status in terms of its impact on recidivism. It doesn't seem to be a significant risk factor here.\n\nEducation and employment history are crucial. She has a high school diploma and hasn't been enrolled in college, which suggests she might not have higher education opportunities available to her. Additionally, she has held four jobs during the year, indicating some level of work experience but also possibly working multiple jobs due to financial necessity or lack of better options. This could be a significant factor.\n\nDrug use is another important factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which might indicate substance abuse issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, suggesting that her mental health status might not be directly linked to criminal behavior. Let me consider how this fits into the overall risk assessment.\n\nLiving conditions\u2014having lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in a rural area\u2014might suggest a different upbringing compared to urban areas. This could influence her values and behaviors, but it's not directly correlated with recidivism rates.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally might indicate a lack of moral compass or a different perspective on life events. However, this is quite abstract and doesn't provide clear evidence of criminal behavior.\n\nLet me summarize the weights for each factor:\n\n- Arrest history: medium (since she hasn't been convicted)\n- Age and gender: low\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status: low\n- Living situation: low\n- Education and employment history: high\n- Drug use: medium\n- Living conditions: low\n- Belief in God's role: low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. Given the combination of factors, especially the education and employment history, which might indicate a higher likelihood of criminal behavior due to financial necessity or lack of better options, I would assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nCombining all factors, I would predict a medium to high risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism. However, since the question asks for a YES/NO answer and a confidence level between 0 and 100, I'll need to make an educated guess based on the analysis.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to one arrest but no conviction\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as age and gender are not directly correlated with recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as single status does not indicate a higher risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as living alone is not directly linked to recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment_history\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to high school diploma and multiple job experiences\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to past drug use, but no current depression\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as rural living does not significantly impact recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as this belief is not directly correlated with criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
