    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has already had multiple run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me check the scale again - low, medium, high. Considering his past convictions, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nNext, let's look at his age and gender. Being an 18-year-old male, he is still in a critical period of development and decision-making. This factor alone doesn't give us much to go on, but it does suggest that we need to consider the broader context of youth and its impact on risk assessment. I'll rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nNow, let's examine his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 215 lbs. While these factors can influence behavior and opportunities for crime, they don't directly correlate with recidivism rates. So, I would classify this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving in a large household at a young age could indicate social influences that might affect his behavior. However, without specific details on the nature of those influences, it's hard to assign a clear risk level. I'll go with \"medium\" for now.\n\nHis educational background is another factor. He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests he may not have access to higher education or certain career opportunities that could provide alternatives to crime. I'll rate this as \"low.\"\n\nEmployment history shows he has held two jobs during the year, which indicates some level of employment stability. However, given his arrest record, it's likely that these jobs are not in fields where he would be less likely to engage in criminal activity. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years and recently felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems that could influence his behavior. I'll rate this as \"high.\"\n\nHis belief in God might play a role in how he perceives himself and his place in the world, but it's not directly linked to recidivism rates. So, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nFinally, his conviction history is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior. Given that he has already been convicted multiple times, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. I'll rate this as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction and assign a confidence level.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Being an 18-year-old male may indicate a critical period in development and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"large_household\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household at a young age may influence social influences, but specifics are unknown.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment suggests limited access to higher education or career opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs during the year indicate some employment stability, but likely not in fields with lower crime risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and feelings of despair suggest potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
