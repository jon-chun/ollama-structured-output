    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Given that he has a history of arrests and convictions, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is that repeated arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal activity, which increases the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 21 years old and male, there are specific trends in recidivism rates for these demographics. However, without more detailed information on his background and circumstances, I will assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning is that while age and gender can be predictive, they alone do not provide enough context to make a definitive judgment.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 165 lbs. These details are less relevant to recidivism rates but could influence other factors such as employment opportunities or access to resources. Therefore, I will assign this factor a low weight. The reasoning is that while these characteristics might affect his ability to find employment or participate in community programs, they do not directly correlate with recidivism.\n\nHis marital status and living situation are also important. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests he may have more freedom and less support from family, which could potentially increase the risk of criminal behavior. However, without more context on his living situation or access to resources, I will assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning is that while living alone might provide some autonomy, it also means fewer social supports, which could influence his decision-making.\n\nHis educational background and employment history are crucial. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and has held only one job during the year. This indicates significant gaps in education and employment, which can be strong predictors of recidivism. Therefore, I will assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning is that limited education and unemployment often correlate with higher rates of criminal behavior.\n\nHis substance use history is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has experienced feelings of depression in the past month. This suggests he may be at risk for substance abuse or mental health issues, which can both contribute to criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning is that drug use and mental health issues are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHis family background is also important. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 when he was young. This suggests he may have grown up in a disadvantaged environment, which can increase the risk of criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning is that while living in a large household does not necessarily indicate disadvantage, it could suggest limited resources or support.\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences is an interesting factor. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests he may be seeking spiritual guidance or meaning in his life, which can sometimes influence behavior. However, without more context on how this belief affects his decision-making, I will assign this factor a low weight. The reasoning is that while faith can play a role in one's life, it does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\n\nNow, let me summarize the weights and provide a prediction based on these factors:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"While age and gender can be predictive, they alone do not provide enough context to make a definitive judgment.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"These details are less relevant to recidivism rates but could influence other factors such as employment opportunities or access to resources.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may provide some autonomy, but it also means fewer social supports, which could potentially increase the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"high\", \"Limited education and unemployment can be strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use and mental health issues are both strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household does not necessarily indicate disadvantage, but it could suggest limited resources or support.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god_and_personal_experiences\", \"low\", \"While faith can play a role in one's life, it does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
