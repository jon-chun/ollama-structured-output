    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means that his life experiences are relatively limited compared to older adults. This suggests that his risk factors might be more influenced by his environment and immediate circumstances rather than long-term patterns of behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates that he has had interactions with the legal system in the past. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it suggests that these incidents might be isolated events rather than indicative of a pattern of criminal behavior. I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 230 lbs. These characteristics don't directly influence his risk factors in terms of criminal behavior or recidivism. They are more related to his physical health and appearance. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his marital status. He has never been married and is currently living alone. This suggests that he might be more independent and less influenced by family dynamics in terms of criminal behavior. However, it doesn't directly impact his risk factors for recidivism. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational status. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. Education can be a protective factor against crime, as it often leads to better job opportunities and higher education levels. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his employment history. He has held 2 jobs during the year. This suggests that he is actively engaged in the workforce and might have more stable financial circumstances. However, it doesn't directly impact his risk factors for recidivism. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) but has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that he might be using substances for recreational purposes rather than as an escape from depression or other mental health issues. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his family background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. Growing up in a large household and living in an urban area might expose him to different social environments and influences. However, it doesn't directly impact his risk factors for recidivism. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, let's consider his personal beliefs. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests that he might have a strong sense of moral values and a belief in divine guidance. However, it doesn't directly impact his risk factors for recidivism. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the limited number of incidents and the lack of conviction, as well as other protective factors such as education and employment, I would predict that he is less likely to be rearrested within three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"NO\".\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level based on the analysis. Considering all the factors, I would assign a confidence level of 60%.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age may limit life experiences and influence risk factors\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male individuals may be more likely to engage in certain behaviors, but this factor is not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly impact risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status does not directly influence risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Enrollment in school may indicate a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment history does not directly impact risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Past substance use is not necessarily indicative of future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Family background may influence life experiences, but its direct impact on recidivism is limited\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs do not directly affect risk factors for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
