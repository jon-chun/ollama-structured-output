    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested 10 times and convicted. This is a significant number of arrests over a short period. Given that he has been arrested multiple times, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is the frequency and severity of these incidents suggest a pattern of behavior that may increase his likelihood of future criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's look at his conviction history. He has been convicted, which indicates a clear history of breaking the law. This factor also deserves a high weight because it shows a consistent disregard for the law, suggesting a higher risk of rearrest.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 165 lbs. While these characteristics do not directly correlate with criminal behavior, they might influence how he interacts with law enforcement or the severity of potential offenses. However, given the context of his arrest history and conviction, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nMoving on to his living situation. He is currently living alone and has never been married. This suggests a lack of social support and potentially a higher risk of isolation, which could be linked to criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, let's consider his educational background. He has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. While education can provide opportunities for personal growth and development, it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Thus, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his employment history. He has held no jobs during the year. This suggests a lack of positive role models and potentially increased risk of engaging in criminal activities. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, let's consider his substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana). While marijuana is not typically associated with violent crime, it could indicate a pattern of substance abuse that may influence behavior. However, given the context of his arrest history and conviction, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his mental health status. He has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests he is currently in a relatively stable mental state, which could reduce his risk of engaging in criminal activities. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, let's consider his family background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area at a young age. This suggests he may have been exposed to various influences that could impact his behavior. However, given the context of his arrest history and conviction, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nLastly, let's consider his belief in God. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. While faith can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests over a short period suggest a pattern of behavior that may increase likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Convicted history indicates a clear disregard for the law and higher risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"medium\", \"Tall height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior, but could influence interactions with law enforcement or severity of potential offenses.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone suggests lack of social support and potentially increased risk of isolation, which may be linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma does not directly correlate with criminal behavior, but could indicate limited opportunities for personal growth and development.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"No jobs during the year suggest lack of positive role models and potentially increased risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use suggests pattern of substance abuse that may influence behavior, but not directly correlated with violent crime.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests current stability in mental state and potentially reduced risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in urban household at a young age may have exposed to various influences that could impact behavior, but not directly correlated with crime.\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with criminal behavior, but could provide sense of purpose and moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
