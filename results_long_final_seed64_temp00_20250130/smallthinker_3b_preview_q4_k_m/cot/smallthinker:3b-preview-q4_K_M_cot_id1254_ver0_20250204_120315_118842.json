    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone with multiple convictions. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight are standard for an adult male. There's no indication that these factors contribute significantly to risk assessment beyond basic health considerations. Therefore, I'll label this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his educational background. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lack of formal education, which can be a factor in predicting recidivism. However, the severity might depend on how recent this information is. Since he hasn't been enrolled in college recently, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis employment status: he has held no jobs during the year. This indicates significant unemployment and possibly a lack of positive role models or financial stability. Given that he's currently living alone without any job experience, I'll label this as \"high.\"\n\nHis substance use history is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some time during the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests a pattern of drug use and mental health issues, which are both significant risk factors for recidivism. I'll assign this as \"high.\"\n\nHis living situation: he lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 3 at a young age. This indicates some level of instability and possibly exposure to negative influences. Given the context, I'll label this as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which can be a significant factor in predicting recidivism. However, the severity might depend on how recent this belief is and its impact on behavior. I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nNow, let's consider his overall risk assessment. Given the combination of factors, including arrest history, substance use, unemployment, living situation, and lack of moral accountability, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within three years.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal behavior, but the severity is lower compared to multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are standard for an adult male.
