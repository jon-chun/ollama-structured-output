    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually. However, they can be part of a broader risk assessment framework. Given this context, I would assign these factors a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his arrest history. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is an important factor because it indicates some level of criminal behavior. The fact that he hasn't been convicted suggests that the incident might have been minor or perhaps a mistake. Nonetheless, this still raises concerns about his propensity for future criminal activity. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 287 lbs. These characteristics are not typically significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually. However, they can be part of a broader risk assessment framework. Given this context, I would assign these factors a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his marital status and living situation. He is currently living alone and has never been married. This suggests that he might have some personal issues or difficulties in maintaining relationships. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational background. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests that he might be at risk of not having the skills or education to secure stable employment. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his job history. He has held only one job during the year. This could suggest some instability in his employment and possibly an inability to secure long-term employment. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his substance use history. He has not used any drugs in the past four years. This is a positive factor that suggests he might be at lower risk of engaging in substance-related crimes. I would assign this a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his mental health history. He has not felt depressed over the past month. This is also a positive factor that suggests he might be at lower risk of engaging in criminal behavior due to mental health issues. I would assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his family background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when he was young. This could suggest some difficulties in maintaining relationships or possibly an unstable home environment. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nFinally, let's look at his personal beliefs. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests that he might be more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to a lack of moral compass or accountability. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher propensity for recidivism. I would assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his overall risk assessment. Given the factors above, I would predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal behavior, but the lack of conviction suggests that the incident might have been minor or perhaps a mistake.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never being married may suggest some personal issues or difficulties in maintaining relationships, but it does not necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate and no college enrollment may suggest some instability in education and possibly an inability to secure stable employment, but it does not necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year may suggest some instability in employment, but it does not necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor that suggests lower risk of substance-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month is a positive factor that suggests lower risk of engaging in criminal behavior due to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother and household size 4 may suggest some difficulties in maintaining relationships or possibly an unstable home environment, but it does not necessarily indicate a higher propensity for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which may increase the risk of engaging in criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
