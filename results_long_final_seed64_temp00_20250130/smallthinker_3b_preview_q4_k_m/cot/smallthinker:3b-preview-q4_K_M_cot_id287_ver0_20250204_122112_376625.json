    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means that while he may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, he also has the potential for growth and change. Given this context, I would assign an \"medium\" weight to his age.\n\nNext, his arrest and conviction history. He has been arrested once and convicted, which indicates a pattern of behavior that could lead to future criminal activity. This factor is significant and should be given a high weight. So, I'll mark it as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight range are within the normal limits for an 18-year-old male. There's no indication of any physical health issues that could influence his behavior or risk level. Therefore, this factor will be assigned a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another important factor. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests he may have more freedom to engage in risky behaviors without the constraints of a relationship. However, it also means he might not have a support system that could help him make better choices. Given this balance, I'll assign a medium weight to his marital status.\n\nHis educational background is another key factor. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This indicates some level of education and possibly some stability in his life. However, it's not clear how much this will influence his risk level. So, I'll assign a low weight to his educational status.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held two jobs during the year. This suggests he may have some financial stability and possibly more opportunities for positive development. Therefore, I'll assign a medium weight to his employment history.\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this is not necessarily indicative of future criminal behavior, it does suggest that he may be engaging in risky behaviors. Given this, I'll assign a high weight to his substance use.\n\nHis mental health status is also important. He has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that he may not be experiencing any significant mental health issues at present. Therefore, I'll assign a low weight to his mental health status.\n\nFinally, his family background and personal beliefs are factors that could influence his risk level. Living with both biological parents in a household of size 6 indicates a potentially supportive environment, but also one where he may have faced certain challenges. Additionally, his belief in God suggests a strong sense of moral values, which could act as a deterrent to criminal behavior. Given this mix of factors, I'll assign a medium weight to his family background and personal beliefs.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk assessment. Based on the analysis above, it seems that he has several risk factors that could lead to future criminal activity. However, there are also mitigating factors such as his educational status and sense of moral values. Given this balance, I'll assign a medium weight to his overall risk level.\n\nFinally, let's consider the prediction and confidence level. Based on the analysis, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within three years. However, there are also significant mitigating factors that could influence this outcome. Therefore, I'll assign a 60% confidence level to this prediction.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, he is still a young adult and may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrested_convicted\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested once and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that could lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"His height and weight range are within normal limits for an 18-year-old male.
