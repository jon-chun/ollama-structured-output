    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is within a typical range of ages where criminal behavior might be more prevalent. However, given that he has not been convicted yet, this factor seems to lean towards a lower risk level. So, I'll assign it as \"low.\"\n\nNext, the number of arrests. He has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This suggests some involvement in potentially illegal activities, but since he hasn't been convicted, his actual criminal history is limited. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight are within a normal range for adults. There's no indication that these factors contribute to higher risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nHis marital status is currently single, which doesn't seem to indicate any higher risk factors. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving situation: He is not living alone and has never been married. This suggests a stable living environment, which generally reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. This indicates an ongoing commitment to education and possibly a path towards a more stable future. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nEmployment history: He has held four jobs during the year. While having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate instability or criminal activity, given that he hasn't been convicted yet, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use: He has used drugs in the past four years but not recently. This is a significant factor, as drug use can be linked to higher recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"high.\"\n\nMental health: He has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests he is currently mentally healthy. However, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally might indicate a strong sense of moral values and accountability. This could potentially reduce recidivism. So, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving situation in childhood: He lived with his adoptive parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area. While living in a large household can sometimes lead to behavioral issues, given that he hasn't been convicted yet, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its relevance to personal life suggests a strong moral compass, which could reduce recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. Given that he has used drugs but not recently, held multiple jobs, and has a stable living situation, while also having a strong moral compass, I'll classify his overall risk level as \"medium.\"\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, he is within a typical range of ages where criminal behavior might be more prevalent.
