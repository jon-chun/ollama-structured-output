    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as White. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has already had two run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me think... this factor should be weighted as high.\n\nNext, his conviction. Being convicted once indicates a clear history of breaking the law. This is another strong indicator of future criminal activity. I'll assign this a high weight as well.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. These details don't directly impact recidivism but can be relevant in certain contexts. For now, I'll consider them low-weight factors.\n\nHis marital status is another point to consider. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests a lack of social support network, which could potentially increase the risk of criminal behavior. However, given the limited information, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis educational status is also important. Being enrolled in school at 18 years old indicates that he is currently engaged with education and possibly has a support system through his peers. This should be considered a low-weight factor.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held no jobs during the year. This could indicate a lack of positive role models or financial stability, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior. I'll assign this a medium weight as well.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. While not currently using, his history of drug use suggests a potential for continued substance abuse, which can be linked to criminal activity. This should also be assigned a high weight.\n\nDepression is another factor. He has not felt depressed over the past month, so this is not a significant concern at present. I'll assign this a low-weight factor.\n\nHis family background is complex. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. This suggests a potentially unstable and possibly dysfunctional home environment, which could influence his behavior. Given the limited information, I'll consider this a medium-weight factor.\n\nLastly, his belief in God. While this may provide some sense of purpose or moral guidance, it doesn't directly impact recidivism. I'll assign this a low-weight factor.\n\nNow, let's summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Conviction: high\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status: medium\n- Educational status: low\n- Employment history: medium\n- Drug use: high\n- Depression: low\n- Family background: medium\n- Belief in God: low\n\nBased on these weights, I can now make a prediction and assign a confidence level. Given the significant number of high-weight factors, it's reasonable to predict that he will be rearrested within three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Given his two arrests and conviction, this factor indicates a pattern of breaking the law, which is a strong predictor of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"A single conviction suggests a clear history of breaking the law, increasing the likelihood of further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly impact recidivism but can be relevant in certain contexts.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate a lack of social support network, potentially increasing the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"educational_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school suggests engagement with education and possibly a support system through peers.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"No jobs during the year could indicate a lack of positive role models or financial stability, potentially increasing the risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) suggests a potential for continued substance abuse, which can be linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month indicates that this factor is not currently a concern.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban household of size 4 may suggest a potentially unstable and possibly dysfunctional home environment, influencing his behavior.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly impact recidivism but can provide some sense of purpose or moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
