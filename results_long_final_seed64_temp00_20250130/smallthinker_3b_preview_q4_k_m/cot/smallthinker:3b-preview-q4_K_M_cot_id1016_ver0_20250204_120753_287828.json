    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested three times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor, but since she hasn't been convicted, it might not be as impactful on her risk assessment. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, her physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward and don't seem to influence her risk profile directly. So, I'll give these a low weight.\n\nHer educational background is another factor. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she might face challenges in the job market and could be at higher risk of unemployment. Therefore, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHer employment history: she has held only one job during the year. This indicates limited work experience and potential difficulties in finding stable employment. So, I'll give this a medium weight as well.\n\nHer substance use is another factor. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. However, her mental health history is less clear: she has not felt depressed over the past month, but it's mentioned that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could be a coping mechanism or a belief system, so I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHer living situation is also important. She lives alone and hasn't been married. This suggests she might face challenges in maintaining stable relationships, which could impact her risk profile. So, I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nLastly, her household size: she lived in a household of size 6 at a young age. This could indicate exposure to various influences that might affect her behavior and risk profile. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective impact of these factors on her 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Given the mix of positive and negative factors, I believe she is at medium to high risk. However, since she has not been convicted in any arrests, I'll predict a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to ensure accuracy. After careful consideration, I can confidently say that her overall risk profile suggests a medium to high risk, but given the lack of convictions, I'll predict a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to multiple arrests without conviction, suggesting potential for future non-violent offenses.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as height and weight do not significantly impact risk profile.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to lack of high school diploma or GED certificate, potentially limiting job prospects and increasing risk of unemployment.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to limited work experience and potential difficulties in finding stable employment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as no recent drug use detected, suggesting low likelihood of substance-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to living alone and lack of marital status, potentially indicating challenges in maintaining stable relationships.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as household size at a young age may not significantly impact current risk profile.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
