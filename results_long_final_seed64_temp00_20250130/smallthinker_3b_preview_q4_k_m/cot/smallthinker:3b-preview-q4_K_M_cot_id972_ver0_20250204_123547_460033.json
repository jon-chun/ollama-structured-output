    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female in question. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight range don't seem to indicate any significant risk factors related to health or appearance. So, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at her educational background. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests that she might be at a disadvantage in terms of future opportunities due to limited education. However, it's important to note that this alone may not necessarily predict a higher risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nHer living situation is currently alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes indicate instability or lack of support, which might be a risk factor. But given the context, it's hard to say for sure. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nHer employment history shows that she has held two jobs during the year. This suggests some level of work experience and financial stability, which could mitigate other risks. So, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, it's important to consider that drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, so even though she hasn't used drugs recently, her history might still be relevant. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nDepression is another factor. She has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. However, depression can be a significant risk factor for both crime and recidivism, so it's important to consider her mental health status. So, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nHer family background is also relevant. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This suggests that she might have grown up in a disadvantaged environment, which could be a risk factor. However, it's important to consider that many people from such backgrounds do not go on to commit crimes. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is an interesting factor. This suggests that she might have a strong sense of personal responsibility and self-reliance, which could be a positive sign. However, it's important to consider how this belief might influence her behavior in the future. So, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"The one-time arrest may indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, but not being convicted suggests that it might be a minor offense or a learning experience.\"),\n    (\"physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight range do not seem to indicate any significant risk factors related to health or appearance.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate may suggest limited educational attainment, which could potentially impact future opportunities but is not necessarily indicative of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone and never married does not necessarily indicate instability or lack of support; it's possible she has found stability in her current living arrangement.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Two jobs during the year suggest some level of work experience and financial stability, which could mitigate other risks.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive sign, but it's important to consider that drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism; her history might still be relevant.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month is a positive sign, but depression can be a significant risk factor for both crime and recidivism; her mental health status is important to consider.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4, urban area may suggest some level of disadvantage or instability, which could potentially impact future behavior; however, it's also possible that she has grown up resilient and resourceful.\"),\n    (\"personal beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests a strong sense of personal responsibility and self-reliance, which could be a positive sign.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
