    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 20 years old, she is still in her early twenties, which means she has some time to grow and change. However, being a woman can sometimes influence how risk assessments are perceived, especially in certain contexts. Let me think about this carefully... Given the context of criminal justice risk assessment, I would assign this factor as \"medium\" because while age is important, gender alone doesn't significantly impact the risk level.\n\nNext, her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor in risk assessment. Let me check the details again... Being arrested without conviction still indicates some level of involvement with the legal system and possibly higher risk behavior. I would assign this as \"high\" because it suggests she may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors or have a history that could lead to future criminal activity.\n\nNow, her physical attributes. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. These details don't directly impact the risk assessment of her criminal behavior. They might be relevant in other contexts, but for this scenario, I would assign this as \"low\" because physical characteristics are generally not considered in risk assessments related to criminal behavior.\n\nHer marital status is another factor. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests she may have more freedom and potentially less supervision, which could influence her behavior. Let me think about this... Given the context of risk assessment, I would assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates some level of independence but also possibly a lack of support system.\n\nHer education level is high school diploma, not enrolled in college. This suggests she may have limited educational opportunities and potentially less access to resources that could help her avoid criminal behavior. Let me consider this... Given the context, I would assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates some level of educational disadvantage but also a potential for growth.\n\nHer employment history is another factor. She has held only one job during the year. This suggests she may have limited work experience and potentially less financial stability. Let me think about this carefully... Given the context, I would assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates some level of economic vulnerability but also a potential for learning and development.\n\nHer substance use is another significant factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This suggests she may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors or have access to resources that could influence her criminal behavior. Let me consider this... Given the context, I would assign this as \"high\" because it indicates a history of substance use, which is often associated with higher risk behavior.\n\nHer living situation is another factor. She has lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This suggests she may have had some level of exposure to different social environments and potentially more freedom. Let me think about this... Given the context, I would assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates some level of exposure to different social environments but also possibly less supervision.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is another factor. This suggests she may have a lower sense of moral responsibility or higher risk tolerance. Let me consider this... Given the context, I would assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates some level of potential for higher risk behavior but also possibly a willingness to take risks.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a collective prediction and confidence score. After careful consideration, I can confidently say that her 3-year rearrest recidivism is likely.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, she is still in her early twenties, which means she has some time to grow and change.
