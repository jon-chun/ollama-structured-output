    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence her behavior. However, given her enrollment in a 2-year college and her current living situation, it seems she has some stability and support. So, I would rate this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nNext, the arrest itself is a significant risk factor. Being arrested once but not convicted still indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. Given that she has been enrolled in college and is currently living alone, it suggests she might be taking steps to avoid further trouble. So, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nHer height and weight are relatively standard for her age and gender. There's no indication that these physical attributes pose a significant risk factor. Therefore, I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nMarital status is another factor. She has never been married, which might suggest some level of independence. However, given the context of her living situation and educational enrollment, it doesn't seem to be a major concern. So, I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is important. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 2-year college indicates she has some education and is actively pursuing further learning. This suggests she might have more opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nEmployment history shows that she has held only one job during the year. This could indicate instability or lack of commitment to work. Given her enrollment in college and living situation, it seems she might be prioritizing education over employment. So, I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use is a significant risk factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically cocaine. This suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could impact her behavior and decision-making. Therefore, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nDepression is another factor. She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. However, given the context of her arrest and drug use, it's important to consider other factors. So, I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving situation shows that she has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This suggests some level of family support but also potentially exposure to various influences. Therefore, I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nBelief in God is interesting. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. While this could be seen as a positive factor for stability and guidance, it's not directly related to risk factors. So, I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the high-risk factors of arrest history, drug use, and employment instability, along with medium-risk factors for age, marital status, education, living situation, and depression, and low-risk factor for belief in God, it seems likely that she will be rearrested within three years.\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level. Given the complexity of these factors and the need to consider multiple variables, I would rate my confidence as 75%.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which may influence her behavior.
