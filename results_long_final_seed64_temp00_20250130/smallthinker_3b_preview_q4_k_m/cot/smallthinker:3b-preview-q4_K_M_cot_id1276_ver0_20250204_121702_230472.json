    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence her behavior. However, given her relatively young age, I would rate this factor as low. The reasoning behind this is that while adolescence can be a challenging time, the individual's current actions and decisions will likely play a more significant role in predicting future behavior.\n\nNext, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is an important factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this factor might have less weight than one would think. I'll rate this as medium. The reasoning here is that while arrests can be a sign of potential risk, the lack of conviction suggests that other factors may be at play.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes. She is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 110 lbs. These details don't directly impact her risk assessment in terms of criminal behavior or recidivism. Therefore, I'll rate this as low. The reasoning is that physical characteristics are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.\n\nNext, let's look at her marital status. She has never been married and lives alone. This factor might suggest a certain level of independence, which could be positive in terms of reducing the risk of substance abuse or other issues. However, given the context of her past drug use and feelings of despair, I'll rate this as medium. The reasoning is that while living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, it doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk behavior.\n\nNow, let's consider her education level. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This factor might suggest some level of self-sufficiency but also indicates a lack of formal education. I'll rate this as low. The reasoning is that educational attainment is generally not directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nNext, let's look at her employment history. She has held 5 jobs during the year. This could indicate instability and possibly higher risk due to financial stress or other issues. However, given the context of her past drug use and feelings of despair, I'll rate this as medium. The reasoning is that multiple job changes can sometimes be a sign of instability.\n\nNow, let's consider her substance abuse history. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This factor is very significant because it directly relates to her mental health and potential for engaging in risky behavior. I'll rate this as high. The reasoning is that substance abuse can significantly increase the risk of criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's look at her living situation. She lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. This factor might suggest some level of family support but also indicates a potentially unstable environment. I'll rate this as medium. The reasoning is that growing up in a large household can sometimes lead to social issues and lack of individual attention.\n\nFinally, let's consider her belief in God. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This factor might suggest some level of moral guidance but also indicates potential for spiritual or religious influences on behavior. I'll rate this as low. The reasoning is that beliefs about a higher power are generally not directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction and assign a confidence score. Given the combination of her past drug use, feelings of despair, and unstable living situation, I would predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism as YES with a confidence level of 80%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 19 years old, the individual is still in her teenage years, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence her behavior.
