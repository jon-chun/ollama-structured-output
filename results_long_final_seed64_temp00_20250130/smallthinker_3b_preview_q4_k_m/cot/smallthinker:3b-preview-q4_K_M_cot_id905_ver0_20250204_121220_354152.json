    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is a significant factor, but since he hasn't been convicted, it might not be as impactful on his recidivism risk. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight range are within normal limits. There's no indication of any health issues or physical characteristics that would suggest higher risk. So, I'll label this as low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size 5 is an important factor. This suggests he has had some form of family support, which could mitigate against recidivism. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis educational background: he has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of higher education, but no direct correlation to criminal behavior is evident. So, I'll label this as low.\n\nEmployment history: he has held 3 jobs during the year. This suggests some level of employment stability, which could be protective against recidivism. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis substance use and mental health: no drug use in the past four years and no feelings of depression over the past month. These are positive indicators that suggest lower risk. So, I'll label this as low.\n\nHis belief in God is an interesting factor. While it's not directly related to criminal behavior, it could potentially influence his decision-making. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the mix of positive and negative indicators, I would predict a low to moderate risk of recidivism. The belief in God might slightly mitigate against recidivism, but other factors suggest a lower risk.\n\nLet's put this all together:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to the number of arrests, but not convicted.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as no health issues or physical characteristics indicating higher risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as living with biological mother suggests some form of family support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as high school diploma and no college enrollment does not indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as holding 3 jobs during the year suggests some level of employment stability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as no drug use in the past four years and no feelings of depression over the past month.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as belief in God is not directly related to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
