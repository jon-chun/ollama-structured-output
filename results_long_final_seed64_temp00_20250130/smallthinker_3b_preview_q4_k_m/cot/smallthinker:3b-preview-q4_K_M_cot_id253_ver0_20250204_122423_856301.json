    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested five times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. Given this, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is that repeated arrests without conviction suggest a higher likelihood of continued criminal behavior.\n\nNext, his physical attributes are straightforward. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 165 lbs. These details do not significantly impact the risk assessment in terms of criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his educational background. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of formal education, which can be a significant predictor of future criminal activity. Given this, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning behind this is that the absence of formal education may limit his opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nHis living situation is also important. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests a lack of stable relationships and possibly a history of instability, which can be linked to higher risk factors. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHis employment status is another critical factor. He has held no jobs during the year. This indicates significant unemployment, which can lead to financial difficulties and increased criminal activity. Given this, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is that unemployment can exacerbate existing risk factors and increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis substance use history is also relevant. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana). This suggests a pattern of drug use, which can be linked to higher risk factors. However, it's important to note that his most recent feeling of depression was over a month ago, which may indicate some level of emotional stability. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHis family background is also significant. He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. This suggests a potentially unstable and possibly disadvantaged upbringing, which can be linked to higher risk factors. Given this, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is that growing up in such a household may limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nFinally, his belief about God's role in personal life is not directly relevant to predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Educational background: medium\n- Living situation: medium\n- Employment status: high\n- Substance use history: medium\n- Family background: high\n\nBased on these assessments, I would predict a 60% chance of rearrest recidivism. This prediction is based on the collective weight of the risk factors.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests without conviction suggest a higher likelihood of continued criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on criminal behavior in terms of physical attributes.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"medium\", \"Lack of formal education may limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships and possibly a history of instability can be linked to higher risk factors.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can exacerbate existing risk factors and increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use suggests a pattern of substance abuse, which can be linked to higher risk factors.
