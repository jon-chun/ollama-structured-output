    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor, but it's important to note that he hasn't been arrested again recently. Let me think about this carefully... Given the context of his current situation and the fact that he hasn't been arrested in a while, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, his conviction history. He has a conviction, which is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior. This factor should be given a high weight since it directly correlates with future criminal activity. Let me check... Yes, conviction history is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\nNow, let's look at his age and gender. The individual is 20 years old and identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. Age can influence risk factors, but in this case, the specific age isn't particularly significant for predicting recidivism. Gender might have some impact, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis physical attributes are also important. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs. These factors don't directly influence risk assessment in criminal justice, so I'll assign them a low weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. The individual has never been married and lives alone. This could potentially indicate higher risk due to lack of social support, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEducation level is also relevant. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism, so I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history is another important factor. He has held no jobs during the year. Lack of employment can indicate higher risk due to limited financial stability and social connections. So, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nSubstance use is a critical factor. The individual has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has experienced feelings of depression. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism, so I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nLiving situation is also relevant. He lived with both biological parents in an urban household of size 4 at a young age. This could potentially indicate higher risk due to family dynamics, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, his belief about God and personal responsibility is important. The individual considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This could potentially indicate lower risk due to higher self-reliance, so I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the high weights for conviction history, substance use, and employment history, along with the medium weights for other factors, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within 3 years. So, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to past arrest and conviction, but no recent arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to prior conviction, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_gender\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as age and gender are not strong predictors on their own.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as physical attributes do not directly influence risk assessment in criminal justice.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as marital status is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to high school diploma and college enrollment, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to lack of employment during the year, indicating potential higher risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to past drug use and feelings of depression, both strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as living situation is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to the individual's belief in personal responsibility.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
