    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward. They don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can be relevant in certain contexts. For instance, being underweight might indicate malnutrition or other health issues, which could potentially affect decision-making. However, given the context of a 19-year-old female, this seems less likely to be a significant factor.\n\nHer marital status and living situation are also important. Being married and living with her spouse suggests a stable home environment, which generally reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. This is a positive factor that I need to consider carefully.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While this might suggest limited educational attainment, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. However, it could indicate a lack of higher education opportunities or other personal issues that might influence her decisions.\n\nEmployment history: Holding two jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability and financial independence. This is generally a positive factor as it suggests she has a stable source of income and may be less likely to engage in criminal activities for financial gain.\n\nSubstance use: She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is a significant positive factor. It suggests that she doesn't have a history of substance abuse or dependence, which could be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nMental health: The statement about feeling down and nothing being able to cheer her up indicates some level of mental distress. This could potentially influence her decision-making but isn't directly correlated with criminal behavior. However, it's an important factor to consider in the context of risk assessment.\n\nFamily background: Living with a biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area suggests a certain level of family support and possibly exposure to different social environments. This could be relevant if there are known patterns of criminal behavior within her family or community, but it's not directly indicative of her individual propensity for crime.\n\nBelief in God: Considering that God has something to do with what happens to her personally is an interesting factor. It suggests a strong belief system and possibly a sense of moral guidance. This could be seen as a protective factor against criminal behavior if she perceives the consequences of such actions as severe or if it influences her decision-making positively.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to these factors based on their perceived impact:\n\n- Arrest history: Medium (since she hasn't been convicted)\n- Physical attributes: Low\n- Marital status and living situation: High (stable home environment reduces risk)\n- Education level: Low\n- Employment history: High (stable employment reduces risk)\n- Substance use: High (no substance abuse history is positive)\n- Mental health: Medium (mental distress could influence behavior but not directly correlated with crime)\n- Family background: Medium (could be relevant if there are known patterns of criminal behavior within her family or community)\n- Belief in God: Low\n\nBased on this analysis, I can now make a prediction and assign a confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to the single arrest but lack of conviction\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to stable home environment reducing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as high school diploma does not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to two jobs indicating stability and financial independence\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to no substance abuse history being positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as mental distress could influence behavior but not directly correlated with crime\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as household size and urban area may have some relevance if there are known patterns of criminal behavior within her family or community\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as belief in God does not directly correlate with criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
