    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors one by one and think through their implications.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 19 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior. However, given the context of this specific case, I'll assign this factor as \"low\" because while youth can be a risk factor, it doesn't necessarily mean he will commit a crime.\n\nNext, his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is a significant factor. Let me think about this carefully. Arrests are often indicative of potential criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like substance use and lack of education. I'll assign this as \"medium\" because it suggests there might be underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nNow, his physical attributes. Being 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 280 lbs doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. However, in some cases, physical characteristics can influence how he interacts with others or the environment around him. I'll assign this as \"low\" because it's not a direct indicator of criminal intent.\n\nHis marital status is another factor. Being married might suggest stability and support, which could potentially reduce his risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors. However, given the other factors present, I'll still assign this as \"low.\"\n\nEducation level is crucial. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests he may not have the educational foundation to navigate society effectively without potentially turning to crime. I'll assign this as \"medium\" because it indicates a significant gap in his educational background.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held 5 jobs during the year. While having multiple jobs can be seen as a positive, it also might indicate instability or a lack of long-term commitment. Given the context, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine). This is a significant risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior. I'll assign this as \"high\" because it suggests he may be more likely to engage in illegal activities.\n\nDepression is not a factor here, which is good news. However, given his other factors, I'll still assign this as \"low.\"\n\nHis family background is also important. He has lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. This suggests he may have grown up in a challenging environment, but it's not directly indicative of criminal behavior. I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nLastly, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is a personal factor that doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to make a prediction and confidence level.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"As a young adult, the individual may still be developing his life skills and values, but given the context of this specific case, it is not necessarily indicative of high-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The fact that he has been arrested twice, although not convicted, suggests that there may be underlying issues that need to be addressed.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior, but in some cases, they can influence how an individual interacts with others or the environment around them.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married may suggest stability and support, which could potentially reduce his risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"The fact that he does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college suggests that he may not have the educational foundation to navigate society effectively without potentially turning to crime.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held 5 jobs during the year may indicate stability, but it also may suggest instability or a lack of long-term commitment, which could be indicative of high-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"The fact that he has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) is a significant risk factor, as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"There is no evidence to suggest that he has felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"The fact that he has lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area, suggests that he may have grown up in a challenging environment, but it does not necessarily correlate with high-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"His belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is a personal factor that does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
