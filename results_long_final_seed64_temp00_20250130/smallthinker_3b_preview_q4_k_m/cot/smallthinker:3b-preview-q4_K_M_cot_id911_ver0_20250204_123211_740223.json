    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant event in his life, and it could indicate some level of criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted multiple times. Let me check the scale again - low seems appropriate here.\n\nNext, I'll look at his age and gender. Being 22 years old is relatively young, which could mean that he still has a significant amount of time to learn from mistakes and potentially change his behavior. However, youth alone doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk factors in this context. So, medium seems like a balanced assessment.\n\nHis height and weight are straightforward; they don't directly impact his criminal risk profile. They might be relevant for other types of assessments, but here, they don't contribute to the risk score. So, low is appropriate.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age could indicate a stable upbringing, which might reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors later in life. This suggests a low risk factor.\n\nHis current living situation - living alone - doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior. It's more about personal preferences and stability. So, low is suitable here as well.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This indicates that he might not have the same opportunities for education or career advancement as someone with higher educational attainment. However, it doesn't necessarily mean he will engage in criminal behavior. So, medium seems appropriate.\n\nJob history: Holding only one job during the year could indicate instability or a lack of commitment to employment. This might suggest some level of risk, but since he has held this job for a short period, I'll rate it as low.\n\nSubstance use and mental health: He hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive indicators that reduce his risk profile. So, low is appropriate here.\n\nHis belief in God might be relevant to his worldview but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. It's more about personal beliefs than actions. So, low is suitable.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal behavior, but the severity is relatively low due to lack of conviction.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"The individual's age is relatively young, which may suggest a lower risk profile. However, this factor alone does not significantly impact the overall assessment.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior in this context.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age may indicate a stable upbringing, potentially reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors later in life.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone does not directly impact the individual's risk profile for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma and lack of college enrollment may suggest some level of educational attainment, but this factor does not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate instability or a lack of commitment to employment, potentially suggesting some risk. However, this is a relatively short period and may not significantly impact the overall assessment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use reduces the risk profile for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk profile for criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
