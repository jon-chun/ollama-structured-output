    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted multiple times. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, I'll look at his age and gender. The individual is 20 years old and identifies as White. Age can be a factor in risk assessment, but it's not always directly correlated with criminal behavior. Gender might also play a role, but it's more nuanced. For now, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs 204 lbs. These details don't seem to have any direct correlation with criminal risk assessment. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another factor. The person has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests some level of independence, which might be protective against certain risks. Let me think about this for a moment.\n\nEducation is also important. He has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college. This indicates that he has completed high school but hasn't pursued further education. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held 4 jobs during the year. This suggests some level of employment stability, which might be protective against certain risks. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This indicates a pattern of substance abuse, which could increase risk. I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nDepression is also important. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that he might not be at risk for depression-related behavior. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nHis living situation is another factor. He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. This could indicate some level of family stress or instability, which might increase risk. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability. This is a significant factor and will be assigned a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the factors above, it seems likely that he might be at risk for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nAfter all these considerations, I can confidently say that the individual has a moderate to high risk of being rearrested within three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal activity, but not necessarily a high risk for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not strong predictors of criminal behavior on their own.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight do not typically influence an individual's likelihood of committing a crime.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and currently not living alone may suggest some level of independence, which could be protective against certain risks.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college indicates some level of education, but also suggests that the individual may not have pursued further educational opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding 4 jobs during the year suggests some level of employment stability, which could be protective against certain risks.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) indicates a pattern of substance abuse, which may increase risk for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests that the individual may not be at risk for depression-related behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household may indicate some level of family stress or instability, which could increase risk for certain behaviors.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to the individual personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which may increase risk for future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
