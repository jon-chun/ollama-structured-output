    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old male who has been arrested once, convicted, and is currently not living alone. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once and convicted. This suggests that he may be at higher risk of reoffending within three years. I'll assign this a medium weight because while it's significant, it doesn't necessarily mean he will reoffend; it just indicates a pattern of behavior.\n\nNext, his age is 20. Being young can sometimes indicate impulsivity and a lack of life experience, which might increase the risk of reoffending. However, I'll assign this a low weight because while youth can be a factor, it's not as directly correlated with criminal behavior as other factors like arrest history.\n\nHis height and weight are within a normal range, so they don't seem to pose any significant risks. Therefore, I'll assign these factors a low weight.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests he might be more independent but also potentially more isolated. However, this factor doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma, which indicates a lower likelihood of higher-paying jobs that might provide stability. This could increase the risk of reoffending due to financial instability. Therefore, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year, which suggests unemployment and potentially increased risk of reoffending. This factor is significant enough to warrant a medium weight.\n\nHis drug use history is concerning, with past four years of using marijuana and cocaine, and some recent feelings of depression. Drug use can be a significant predictor of criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like unemployment and lack of education. Therefore, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nHe has lived in a household of size 4 as a child, which might indicate family instability or neglect. This factor could contribute to behavioral issues but is not directly correlated with reoffending. So, I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass and potential disregard for societal norms. This factor is significant enough to warrant a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall risk factors:\n\n- Arrest history: Medium\n- Age: Low\n- Height/Weight: Low\n- Marital status: Low\n- Education level: Medium\n- Unemployment: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Childhood living conditions: Low\n- Lack of moral compass: Medium\n\nGiven these weights, the overall risk is high. Therefore, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence score.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"While youth can be a factor, it is not directly correlated with criminal behavior in this context.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Normal height and weight do not pose any significant risks.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married does not necessarily indicate higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma may suggest a lower likelihood of higher-paying jobs, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"No job history may indicate unemployment and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) and recent feelings of depression suggest a high risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_conditions\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 as a child may indicate family instability, but not directly correlated with reoffending.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_moral_compass\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal life may suggest a lack of moral compass and potential disregard for societal norms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
