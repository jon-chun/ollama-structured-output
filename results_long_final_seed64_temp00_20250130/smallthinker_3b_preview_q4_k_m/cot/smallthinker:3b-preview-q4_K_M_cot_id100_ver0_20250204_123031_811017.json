    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut who has been arrested nine times and convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of arrests and convictions. This is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior. Given that he has been arrested nine times and convicted, it suggests a pattern of reoffending. This factor should be weighted high because it indicates a significant history of criminal activity.\n\nNext, his height and weight are relatively average for an American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut male. There's no specific data to suggest these physical attributes influence risk assessment in this context, so I'll assign them a low weight.\n\nLiving in a large household at a young age could indicate social or environmental influences that might affect behavior. However, without more detailed information on the nature of those influences, I'll also assign this factor a low weight.\n\nThe lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate and unemployment are significant indicators of educational attainment and employment status. These factors can influence an individual's life choices and opportunities, so they should be weighted medium to high. Given his history of arrests and convictions, the impact might be more pronounced, but I'll assign them a medium weight.\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which could indicate a pattern of drug use that may influence behavior. However, since he hasn't felt depressed over the past month and has no history of addiction or overdose, this factor should be weighted low to medium.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some emotional support or guidance, potentially reducing risk factors. This is more of a qualitative factor and could have a positive impact on his life choices, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the high number of arrests and convictions, lack of education and employment, and substance use, but also considering the belief in God as a mitigating factor, I'll predict a medium to high risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to ensure everything is accurate. Yes, it all checks out. Now, let's put this into the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number_of_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of nine arrests and convictions suggests a pattern of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"No specific data to suggest physical attributes influence risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_in_large_household_at_young_age\", \"low\", \"Limited information on the nature of household influences, so assigning low weight.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_high_school_diploma_or_ged_certificate_and_unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and employment can influence life choices and opportunities, but not as strongly as other factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No history of addiction or overdose, so assigning low weight to substance use risk factor.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support, potentially reducing risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
