    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. However, since he hasn't been convicted yet, it might indicate that he is still in the process of facing legal consequences or that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, his physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight range, which don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can be relevant in certain contexts. Living alone and having never been married might suggest a certain level of independence, but it's not necessarily indicative of criminal tendencies. His educational background is high school diploma, not enrolled in college, which could imply some level of maturity or responsibility, depending on the context.\n\nHis employment history shows he has held two jobs during the year, indicating some level of work experience and possibly a commitment to financial stability. This is generally positive but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. His past drug use (marijuana) over the past four years could be a concern, as substance abuse can sometimes lead to criminal activities. However, he has not felt depressed in the past month, which might suggest that his mental health is relatively stable.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in a rural area at a young age could indicate a certain level of family support or perhaps some formative experiences that have shaped his behavior. His belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally might reflect a strong sense of morality and responsibility, which is generally positive.\n\nLet me summarize these factors and assign weights:\n\n1. Arrest History: Medium - The fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted suggests some level of criminal activity, but it's also possible that the incident was a one-time mistake or that he is still in the process of facing legal consequences.\n2. Physical Attributes: Low - His height and weight range are within normal limits and don't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n3. Living Situation: Medium - Living alone and never being married might suggest independence, but it's not necessarily indicative of criminal tendencies.\n4. Education: Low - A high school diploma is a basic requirement for many jobs and doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n5. Employment History: High - Holding two jobs during the year indicates some level of work experience and possibly financial stability, which could be positive in terms of reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n6. Drug Use: Medium - Past drug use over four years is a concern, but he has not felt depressed in the past month, suggesting that his mental health might be relatively stable.\n7. Family Background: High - Living with both biological parents at a young age could indicate a certain level of family support or perhaps some formative experiences that have shaped his behavior.\n8. Belief in Divine Intervention: Low - This belief doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior and is more related to personal beliefs.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\nPrediction: NO\nConfidence: 60\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting my analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal activity, but it is also possible that the incident was a one-time mistake or that he is still in the process of facing legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"His height and weight range are within normal limits and do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never being married may suggest independence, but it is not necessarily indicative of criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"A high school diploma is a basic requirement for many jobs and does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs during the year indicates some level of work experience and possibly financial stability, which could be positive in terms of reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use over four years is a concern, but he has not felt depressed in the past month, suggesting that his mental health might be relatively stable.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age could indicate a certain level of family support or perhaps some formative experiences that have shaped his behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Divine Intervention\", \"low\", \"This belief does not directly correlate with criminal behavior and is more related to personal beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
