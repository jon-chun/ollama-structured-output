    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted multiple times. Let me check the scale again - low seems appropriate here.\n\nNext, his height and weight are straightforward. They don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign a low risk for these factors.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of size 4 is another factor. This suggests a stable upbringing environment, which generally reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this should also be assigned a low risk.\n\nHis educational background and job history are important. He has a high school diploma but hasn't been enrolled in college, and he's held only one job during the year. These factors suggest limited education and employment stability, which could indicate higher risk for future involvement with the law. Medium seems appropriate here.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), but he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that while there's a history of drug use, it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll assign a low risk for this factor.\n\nHis personal beliefs are also worth considering. He believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a lower likelihood of being influenced by religious or moral considerations in his decision-making process. Low risk seems fitting here.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall prediction. Given the factors analyzed, it seems there is a moderate likelihood of rearrest recidivism. The combination of limited education and employment stability, along with past drug use, suggests a higher risk profile. However, the lack of conviction and stable upbringing environment temper this risk somewhat.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some level of involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 suggests a stable upbringing environment.\"),\n    (\"education_and_job_history\", \"medium\", \"Limited education and employment stability may indicate higher risk for future involvement with the law.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past drug use does not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like lack of depression.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in personal autonomy suggests a lower likelihood of being influenced by religious or moral considerations.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
