He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 230 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4.
