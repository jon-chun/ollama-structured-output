    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll identify all the risk factors present in the provided example. The case is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White, has been arrested 3 times and convicted, weighs 215 lbs, never married, currently living alone, has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college, has held two jobs, used marijuana in the past four years, felt down for a month, lived with both parents in a household of size 7, and considers God's influence.\n\nNext, I'll analyze each risk factor against the provided examples. \n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: In the examples, factors like being arrested once or twice were associated with higher recidivism rates (e.g., 30-50%). Since this case has been convicted three times, it's likely a high risk.\n\n2. **Weight**: The person is 18 years old, which falls within the middle age range. This doesn't directly affect recidivism but might influence factors like substance use and living alone.\n\n3. **Height**: 6 feet 1 inch is above average for males, which could be a positive factor as it's not too short or tall, possibly affecting mental health.\n\n4. **Married/Spouse**: The case doesn't mention being married, so this might be considered low risk if the spouse isn't relevant here.\n\n5. **Jobs held**: Holding two jobs suggests some level of stability and financial security, which could reduce recidivism.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant factor. In examples, higher drug use was associated with lower recidivism rates (e.g., 20-30%). This case's drug use history should be considered low risk.\n\n7. **Mood and Depression**: Feeling down for a month could indicate underlying issues that might affect recidivism. However, since the person is currently living alone, this might help in reducing recidivism by providing a sense of safety.\n\n8. **Household size**: Living with both parents in a small household (size 7) suggests a stable environment, which can lower recidivism rates.\n\n9. **God's Influence**: The case mentions considering God's influence, which is a positive factor as it implies a supportive environment for mental health and behavior change.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights to each risk factor based on the above analysis:\n\n- Arrests/Convictions: High (30-50%)\n- Height: Medium\n- Job stability: Medium\n- Marital status: Low\n- Drug use: Low\n- Living alone: Low\n- Household size: Low\n- God's influence: High\n\nNext, I'll evaluate the case against these factors. The person has been convicted three times (high), is 18 years old (medium), not married (low), holds two jobs (moderate), uses marijuana (low), lives alone (low), has a high school diploma (medium), and considers God's influence (high). \n\nConsidering the high arrest rate, moderate height, low marital status, moderate job stability, low drug use, living alone, medium education level, and high God's influence. The combination of these factors suggests that the person is at a higher risk for recidivism.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll predict that the case will have a high probability of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"The case has been convicted three times, indicating a significant risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"medium\", \"The individual's height is above average for males, which may contribute to mental health factors that could affect recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests some level of financial and job security, potentially reducing recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"No information about marital status, but living alone might provide a sense of safety and stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a significant factor that could be associated with lower recidivism rates.
