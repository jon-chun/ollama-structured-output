    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided information about the case:\n\n- **Age**: 19 years old\n- **Identifies as White**\n- **Arrested 5 times and convicted**\n- **Weighted by:**\n  - High School diploma or GED? No (he's not enrolled in college)\n  - Divorce status? Yes\n  - Currently living alone? Yes\n  - No high school diploma or GED, so no credit history\n  - Not a U.S. citizen\n  - Not from a family with significant resources\n- **Job history**: 6 jobs during the year (highly variable)\n- **Drug use**: Past four years: marijuana and cocaine\n- **Emotional state**: Most of the time feeling down, not feeling better\n- **Household size at young age**: 7 people in a rural area\n\nNow, I'll compare this case with the provided examples to assign weights to each risk factor.\n\n1. **High School Diploma or GED?**  \n   The examples show that if someone has a high school diploma or GED, it's more likely to have lower recidivism rates. Since he doesn't have one and is not enrolled in college, this factor is high.\n\n2. **Divorce status?**  \n   Divorce can lead to higher recidivism because people might feel isolated. The examples show that being married or living with a spouse (as in his case) reduces recidivism. So, this factor is low.\n\n3. **Currently living alone?**  \n   Living alone increases recidivism as there's no support system. His case fits this, so it's low.\n\n4. **No U.S. citizen status?**  \n   Being from a non-U.S. state might affect recidivism rates. The examples don't show significant differences between U.S. citizens and others, but since he's not a U.S. citizen, this is considered high.\n\n5. **No family with significant resources?**  \n   He's living alone in a rural area with 7 people, which suggests no significant support network. This factor is low.\n\n6. **No credit history (no high school diploma or GED)?**  \n   His lack of education and no credit history makes him more likely to recidivate. This is high.\n\n7. **High variability in jobs?**  \n   The job history isn't consistent, which might lead to higher recidivism. So, this factor is medium.\n\n8. **Past four years: marijuana and cocaine use?**  \n   Using drugs can worsen mental health issues, leading to higher recidivism. This is high.\n\n9. **Emotional state: feeling down?**  \n   The case shows he's feeling down, which could contribute to recidivism. This is medium.\n\n10. **Household size at young age (7 people)?**  \n    A larger household might mean more stress and potential for recidivism. This is low.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on the above reasoning:\n\n- High School Diploma or GED: Medium\n- Divorce: Low\n- Alone: Low\n- U.S. citizen: High\n- Family resources: Low\n- No credit history: High\n- Job variability: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Emotional state: Medium\n- Household size: Low\n\nNext, I'll evaluate each factor in the case against these weights:\n\n1. **High School Diploma or GED?**  \n   He doesn't have a diploma and isn't enrolled. So, this is Medium.\n\n2. **Divorce:** Yes, he's living with his spouse. Low.\n\n3. **Alone:** Yes, he's living alone. Low.\n\n4. **U.S. citizen:** No. High.\n\n5. **Family resources:** Rural area with 7 people. Low.\n\n6. **No credit history:** He lacks education and no diploma. High.\n\n7. **Job variability:** 6 jobs during the year. Medium.\n\n8. **Drug use:** Past four years, used both. High.\n\n9. **Emotional state:** Feeling down. Medium.\n\n10. **Household size:** 7 people. Low.\n\nNow, I'll assess if any factors are significantly high or low. The U.S. citizen status is the highest (High), which has a significant impact on recidivism rates. Since he's not a U.S. citizen and lacks education, this factor is very high.\n\nConsidering all these, the case likely has a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma or GED?\", \"Medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED status significantly increases recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Divorce\", \"Low\", \"Living with a spouse reduces recidivism as there's no support system.\")\n    ,(\"Alone\", \"Low\", \"Living alone increases recidivism due to isolation and potential stress.\")\n    ,(\"U.S. citizen\", \"High\", \"Being from a non-U.S. state may affect recidivism rates, though examples don't show significant differences between U.S. citizens and others.\")\n    ,(\"Family resources\", \"Low\", \"A rural household with 7 people suggests limited support network.\")\n    ,(\"No credit history\", \"High\", \"Lack of education and no credit history make him more likely to recidivate.\")\n    ,(\"Job variability\", \"Medium\", \"6 jobs during the year may lead to higher recidivism due to inconsistent income.)\n    ,(\"Drug use\", \"High\", \"Past four years using marijuana and cocaine worsens mental health issues, increasing recidivism.\")\n    ,(\"Emotional state\", \"Medium\", \"Feeling down could contribute to mental health issues leading to recidivism.\")\n    ,(\"Household size\", \"Low\", \"A larger household with 7 people may increase stress and potential for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"outcome\": \"High\"\n}",
