    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll identify the key risk factors in the provided case:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old.\n2. **Gender**: Female.\n3. **Identification**: White.\n4. **Arrest history**: 1 time but not convicted.\n5. **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n6. **Job history**: Has held 3 jobs during the year.\n7. **Drug use**: No past drug use (though she has feelings of depression).\n8. **Household size**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4.\n9. **Education**: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n10. **Age at recidivism prediction**: Young age.\n\nNext, I'll analyze each risk factor against the provided examples to assign weights (low, medium, high).\n\n### Risk Factor Analysis:\n\n1. **Age (22)**: In the examples, older individuals (like 30) had lower recidivism rates compared to younger ones. So, higher age might correlate with lower recidivism.\n   \n2. **Gender (Female)**: Female cases in examples often had lower recidivism rates than males. This suggests that gender could be a significant factor.\n\n3. **Identification (White)**: In the examples, White individuals generally had lower recidivism rates compared to non-Whites. So, being White might reduce recidivism risk.\n\n4. **Arrest history**: Cases with 1 arrest but not convicted had higher recidivism rates than those without arrests. This indicates that fewer arrests are associated with lower recidivism.\n\n5. **Marital status (Lived alone)**: In the examples, living alone was associated with lower recidivism rates. So, being single or in a household of one might reduce risk.\n\n6. **Job history**: Cases with 3 jobs had higher recidivism rates than those with fewer jobs. This suggests that more job stability is protective against recidivism.\n\n7. **Drug use (None)**: Since the case has no past drug use, this factor isn't present here. However, in general, non-drug users might have lower recidivism.\n\n8. **Household size**: In the examples, smaller households (like 4) had higher recidivism rates than larger ones. This suggests that being in a smaller household reduces risk.\n\n9. **Education (High school diploma)**: Cases with high school diplomas generally had lower recidivism rates compared to those without degrees. So, education level is protective.\n\n10. **Age at prediction**: Younger individuals might have higher recidivism because they're more vulnerable. However, in this case, the person is 22, which is not extremely young but still relatively young.\n\n### Weighted Risk Factors:\n\n- **Age (22)**: Medium risk factor. Higher age may correlate with lower recidivism.\n  \n- **Gender (Female)**: Low risk factor. Female cases generally have lower recidivism rates.\n\n- **Identification (White)**: Low risk factor. White individuals tend to have lower recidivism.\n\n- **Arrest history**: High risk factor. Fewer arrests are associated with lower recidivism.\n\n- **Marital status (Lived alone)**: Medium risk factor. Living alone is protective, but not as much as being single.\n\n- **Job history**: Low risk factor. More jobs may provide more stability and reduce recidivism.\n\n- **Drug use (None)**: Not applicable here since there's no drug use history.\n\n- **Household size (4)**: Medium risk factor. Smaller households are protective.\n\n- **Education (High school diploma)**: High risk factor. Higher education is protective.\n\n- **Age at prediction**: Low risk factor. Younger age may increase recidivism, but not as much as other factors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nConsidering all the factors, the person's high school education and being White reduce recidivism risk. However, her 22-year-old age and living with a small household might slightly increase the risk. The arrest history (1 time) is moderate, so it doesn't significantly impact the outcome. Her job history isn't present, but more jobs could be protective.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll predict that the recidivism rate for this case is likely to be **NO**.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Higher age may correlate with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Female cases generally have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Identification (White)\", \"low\", \"White individuals tend to have lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"Arrest history (1 time but not convicted)\", \"high\", \"Fewer arrests are associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status (Lived alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is protective, but not as much as being single\"),\n    (\"Job history (3 jobs during the year)\", \"low\", \"More jobs may provide more stability and reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug use (None)\", \"not applicable\", \"No past drug use data provided\"),\n    (\"Household size (4)\", \"medium\", \"Smaller households are protective\"),\n    (\"Education (High school diploma)\", \"high\", \"Higher education is protective\"),\n    (\"Age at prediction (22)\", \"low\", \"Younger age may increase recidivism, but not as much as other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"outcome\": \"NO\"\n}\n```",
