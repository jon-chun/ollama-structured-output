    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed scenario where they need to predict the recidivism rate for an 18-year-old male based on various risk factors. They've given examples of similar cases with their outcomes and explanations, which I can use as a guide.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all the risk factors present in the case:\n\n1. **Arrests and convictions**: The individual has been arrested 6 times and convicted.\n2. **Age**: 18 years old.\n3. **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n4. **Education level**: Enrolled in school at the present moment.\n5. **Job history**: Has held one job during the year.\n6. **Drug use**: Has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n7. **Depression**: Not feeling depressed over the past month.\n8. **Living situation**: Lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6 in an urban area at a young age.\n\nNext, I'll analyze each factor to determine its weight (low, medium, high) based on the provided examples. \n\n- **Arrests and convictions**: In all examples where someone was convicted or had multiple arrests, the recidivism rate was higher. For instance, in Example 10, a person with multiple arrests and convictions had a high recidivism rate. So, this factor is likely to be high.\n  \n- **Age (18)**: Generally, younger individuals are more likely to recidivate because they have less time to learn new skills or adjust to life changes. However, in the examples provided, age alone wasn't a clear indicator of recidivism rate. But since this person is 18 and not too young, it's plausible that their risk factors might be moderate.\n\n- **Marital status**: Being single can lead to higher recidivism rates because there are fewer support systems available. This factor seems high.\n  \n- **Education level**: Enrolled in school suggests they have some education, which could influence their behavior. However, without specific examples, it's hard to say if this is medium or high.\n\n- **Job history**: Holding a job can provide stability and opportunities for reoffending. In the examples, holding a job didn't directly correlate with higher recidivism rates, so maybe it's low.\n  \n- **Drug use**: High drug use is strongly associated with recidivism. The individual has used multiple substances, which likely increases their risk. This factor should be high.\n\n- **Depression**: Not feeling depressed might mean they're more motivated to engage in criminal behavior. However, if depression were a significant factor, it would have been reflected elsewhere. Since it's not mentioned, I'll consider this as medium.\n  \n- **Living situation**: Lived with biological mother in an urban area suggests family support and community resources. This could lead to lower recidivism rates because there are more support systems available. So, this might be low.\n\nNow, weighing these factors:\n\n- Multiple arrests (high) \u2192 high risk\n- Age moderate \u2192 medium risk\n- Single status high \u2192 high risk\n- Education level unclear but likely not too bad \u2192 medium risk\n- Job history low \u2192 lower risk\n- Drug use high \u2192 very high risk\n- Depression medium \u2192 somewhat higher risk\n- Urban living situation low \u2192 lower risk\n\nConsidering all these, the recidivism rate is likely to be very high because of multiple arrests, drug use, and living in an urban area with a single parent. These factors together suggest that the individual has significant risks of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted multiple times, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\",\n    \"In all provided examples where individuals were convicted or had multiple arrests, the recidivism rate was high.
