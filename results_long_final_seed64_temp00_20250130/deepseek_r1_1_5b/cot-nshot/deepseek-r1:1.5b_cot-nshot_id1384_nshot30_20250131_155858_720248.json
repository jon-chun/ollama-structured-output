    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the input means. The case provided is a 19-year-old female with several risk factors:\n\n- Marital status: Married and living with spouse.\n- Education: No high school diploma or GED; not enrolled in college.\n- Employment history: Worked for one job during the year.\n- Drug use: Used marijuana and cocaine, felt down sometimes.\n- Home environment: Lived with biological mother in a rural area.\n\nThe examples provided are from various cases, each with their own risk factors and outcomes. My goal is to assign weights (low, medium, high) to each of the case's risk factors based on these examples and then predict whether the recidivism outcome will be \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nLet me list out all the risk factors for this specific case:\n\n1. Marital status: Married.\n2. Education: No diploma, not enrolled in college.\n3. Employment history: Worked one job.\n4. Drug use: Used marijuana and cocaine, felt down sometimes.\n5. Home environment: Lived with biological mother in a rural area.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these factors against the examples given. \n\nStarting with **Marital status**: In the examples, cases where the person was married (like Example 1) had outcomes that were \"YES\". For instance, a married female without a high school diploma and feeling down sometimes might predict higher recidivism. So I'll assign \"high\" to this factor.\n\nNext, **Education**: The case lacks a high school diploma or GED. Looking at the examples, cases with no diploma (Examples 1, 2, 3, etc.) had outcomes that were mostly \"NO\". For example, someone without a diploma and feeling down might not recidivate as much. So I'll assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\n**Employment history**: The case worked one job during the year. In examples where employment was low (Examples 1, 2, etc.), outcomes were mostly \"NO\". For instance, someone with no education and feeling down might not recidivate. So I'll assign \"low\".\n\n**Drug use**: The case used both marijuana and cocaine, which are known to be potent substances. In examples where drug use was significant (Examples 1, 2, etc.), outcomes were mostly \"NO\". For example, someone with a history of drug use and feeling down might not recidivate. So I'll assign \"low\".\n\n**Home environment**: Lived with biological mother in a rural area. In the examples, cases where the person lived with their biological parent (like Examples 1, 2, etc.) had outcomes mostly \"NO\". For instance, someone who lived with their biological parent and felt down might not recidivate. So I'll assign \"low\".\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Marital status: high\n- Education: low\n- Employment history: low\n- Drug use: low\n- Home environment: low\n\nNext, I need to determine the overall weight of each factor. Since some factors are more indicative of higher recidivism than others, I might assign a higher weight to marital status and lower weights to the rest.\n\nAssuming that being married is a significant risk factor (high), while other factors like education, employment, drug use, and home environment are less significant (low).\n\nNow, considering the case's specific circumstances: she's married, has no diploma, worked one job, used drugs, lived with her mother in rural area. All these points contribute to higher recidivism risk.\n\nLooking at the examples again, cases where someone was married and had a history of drug use and feeling down (Examples 1, 2) had outcomes mostly \"NO\". So this case fits within that pattern.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, especially the high marital status and significant drug use, it's likely that recidivism is predicted as \"NO\".\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since all risk factors point towards higher recidivism, but the specific circumstances don't show a clear trend beyond what's seen in examples, I might assign a moderate confidence of around 70%.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Risk factors: Marital status (high), Education (low), Employment history (low), Drug use (low), Home environment (low).\n- Prediction: NO\n- Confidence: 70%\n\nI think that's a reasonable assessment based on the given examples and the specific circumstances of this case.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Home environment\", \"low\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70%\n}",
