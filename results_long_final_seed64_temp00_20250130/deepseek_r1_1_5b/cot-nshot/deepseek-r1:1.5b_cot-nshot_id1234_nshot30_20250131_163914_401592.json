    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each component of the input means. The case provided has several risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old.\n2. **Gender**: Black.\n3. **Arrest history**: 1 time but not convicted.\n4. **Marital status**: Living alone.\n5. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED certificate, not enrolled in college.\n6. **Employment**: No jobs during the year.\n7. **Drug use**: Used marijuana for some time and felt down.\n8. **Childhood home**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 2.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each has a set of risk factors with their respective weights (low, medium, high) based on how they were analyzed. The goal is to apply similar reasoning to this case.\n\nLet's go through each risk factor one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old. In previous examples, age wasn't a significant factor because recidivism was more influenced by other factors like gender, education, and substance use. So, I'll assign \"medium\" weight.\n   \n2. **Gender**: Black. From the examples, being Black didn't seem to be a major risk factor for recidivism. It might have been considered low or medium, but since it wasn't prominent in others, maybe \"low\".\n   \n3. **Arrest history**: 1 time but not convicted. This is similar to other cases where arrest history was low (e.g., 0 or 1 times). So, I'll assign \"low\" weight.\n   \n4. **Marital status**: Living alone. In examples, living with a partner wasn't a significant factor either. It might have been considered medium because it's not a major risk compared to others.\n   \n5. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED. This is similar to other cases where education was low (e.g., no diploma). So, \"low\" weight.\n   \n6. **Employment**: No jobs during the year. This wasn't a factor in previous examples because recidivism was more about substance use and mental health issues. So, maybe \"medium\".\n   \n7. **Drug use**: Used marijuana for some time and felt down. In examples, drug use didn't seem to be a major risk factor (e.g., no or minimal use). So, \"low\" weight.\n   \n8. **Childhood home**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 2. This wasn't a significant factor either; it might have been considered medium because it's not a major risk compared to others.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Gender: Low\n- Arrest history: Low\n- Marital status: Medium\n- Education: Low\n- Employment: Medium\n- Drug use: Low\n- Childhood home: Medium\n\nNext, I need to assess how each factor contributes to recidivism. From previous examples, factors like substance use (marijuana) and mental health issues (feeling down) were strong predictors of recidivism. However, in this case, the person is Black, which wasn't a significant factor, and she's married, which might have been considered medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has some substance use but no significant education or employment history. She's living with a partner (medium) and not married (medium). The arrest history was low, so overall, this seems like a moderate risk. However, given that she's Black and hasn't been convicted, which are factors from previous examples, it leans towards recidivism.\n\nAfter considering all the weights and the nature of each factor, I predict that this case has a high chance of rearresting.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Childhood home\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
