    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study about a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is currently living alone, married with his spouse, has a high school diploma, and hasn't used drugs in the past four years. He's been arrested once but not convicted, weighs between 150-174 lbs, has never been married, holds two jobs during the year, and has experienced significant emotional downfalls.\n\nFirst, I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor. The user provided several examples where different factors were analyzed with their respective weights. Looking at these examples, it seems that factors like being living alone, having no high school diploma, not holding multiple jobs, and experiencing depression are more concerning. \n\nNext, I'll evaluate each risk factor individually:\n\n1. **Living Alone**: This is a significant concern because it affects mental health and social support. The user's example with someone living alone in a 5-person household had a negative outcome (NO). So, this seems high.\n\n2. **No High School Diploma**: In the examples, holding no diploma was associated with higher recidivism rates. This case fits well here since he has never been married and holds two jobs, which might indicate some level of education or work experience, but it's still a concern.\n\n3. **Not Enrolled in College**: The user didn't mention any college enrollment status, so I'll assume this is low because higher education typically reduces recidivism rates.\n\n4. **Holding Two Jobs**: This could mean more income and potentially better job security, which might reduce recidivism. However, it's still a positive factor but not the highest.\n\n5. **Emotional Downfalls**: The user mentioned feeling down in the dumps, which is severe. In previous examples, this led to negative outcomes (NO). So, this seems high.\n\n6. **Arrested Once**: This might indicate some recidivism potential, but it's a low factor compared to others.\n\n7. **Weighted Reasoning**: Combining living alone (high), emotional distress (high), and no diploma (medium) gives a total of 200%. The other factors are lower, so the overall risk is high.\n\n8. **Prediction**: Based on the weighted reasoning, this case has a high risk of recidivism, leading to a NO outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone significantly impacts mental health and social support, which can lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"no_high_school_diploma\", \"medium\", \"A lack of education typically correlates with higher recidivism rates compared to those with a high school diploma.\"),\n    (\"not_enrolled_in_college\", \"low\", \"Higher education generally reduces recidivism rates, so this factor is considered low.\"),\n    (\"holding_two_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs can indicate better job security and financial stability, which may reduce recidivism.\"),\n    (\"emotional_downfalls\", \"high\", \"Severe emotional distress during the past month has been linked to higher recidivism rates in previous examples.\"),\n    (\"arrested_once\", \"low\", \"A single arrest may suggest some potential for recidivism but is considered a low factor compared to others.\"),\n    (\"weighting_factors\", \"200%\", \"The combination of living alone, emotional distress, and no high school diploma results in the highest risk among the factors provided.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
