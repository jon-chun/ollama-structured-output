    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The user provided a detailed case study about a 22-year-old male who is facing rearrest recidivism prediction. They want me to assign weights to each risk factor based on given examples and then predict whether he will rearrest in three years.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors present in the case. From the description:\n\n- He's a 22-year-old male.\n- Identifies as White.\n- Has been arrested twice and convicted.\n- Weighs 6 feet 3 inches (probably height).\n- Weights are based on recidivism, so factors like criminal history, education, living situation, etc.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each has a set of risk factors with their respective weights. For instance, in Example #10, he's a Black man, had a high school diploma, lived alone, and considered God unrelated to his situation. The outcome was NO because he didn't have enough criminal history or education.\n\nNow, applying this to the current case:\n\n- **Arrests/Convictions**: He has been arrested twice and convicted. In examples like #10, having a high school diploma but no prior convictions led to a lower recidivism rate (NO). So, two arrests might be considered low risk if other factors are strong.\n  \n- **Education**: He's a high school graduate, which is good for recidivism prediction because educated people often have better opportunities and less criminal behavior.\n\n- **Living Situation**: Currently living alone. In examples like #10, being single or living with one parent can be a positive factor as it reduces support networks and increases isolation, which might lead to lower recidivism rates.\n\n- **Job History**: He's never been employed, but in the current case, he has a job during the year (he's married now). However, since he's currently single, maybe his employment status is less relevant. But having no prior convictions and being White might be more significant.\n\n- **Height/Weight**: 6'3\" and 190 lbs. These are physical factors that can influence recidivism rates. Taller individuals might have different behaviors compared to shorter ones, but in this case, he's White, which is a positive factor as seen in examples like #10.\n\n- **Family Background**: He's currently living with adults other than biological parents, which was his situation in Example #10. This could be considered neutral or even positive because it reduces the impact of family dynamics on recidivism.\n\nPutting this together: He has a high school diploma (good), no prior convictions (low risk if others are strong). He's White, which is a positive factor. He's currently single and living alone, which might reduce support networks but could also mean more isolation. His height and weight don't seem to be the main factors here.\n\nIn Example #10, two arrests were associated with lower recidivism rates because of good education and other factors. Here, he has no prior convictions, which is a strong indicator of low risk. The positive family background (living with non-biological parents) also supports this. His living situation being neutral might not significantly affect the outcome.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, I would predict that his rearrest recidivism rate for three years will be NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"low\", \"Two prior convictions are associated with lower recidivism rates in examples like #10 and #28.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"He is a high school graduate, which is a positive factor for recidivism prediction as seen in examples like #10 and #27.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"neutral\", \"Currently living alone may reduce support networks but could also mean more isolation, as seen in Example #10.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"no prior convictions\", \"He has never been employed, which is a positive factor as seen in examples like #10 and #28.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"neutral\", \"6'3\\\" and 190 lbs are physical factors that can influence recidivism rates but may not be the main determinants here.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"neutral\", \"Currently living with adults other than biological parents, which was his situation in Example #10.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
