    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female case. Let me start by breaking down each risk factor and assigning a weight.\n\nFirst, she's a White woman with no convictions yet. That might be a positive sign because it means she hasn't been convicted of a crime, which could reduce recidivism. But wait, the examples I looked at didn't always have this. Some had no convictions but others did. Hmm, maybe that's not the main factor here.\n\nNext, she has a high school diploma and is in college. That suggests she might have some education level, which could be an advantage. But does that directly affect recidivism? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about her ability to handle the situation rather than past behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. That's a bit concerning because being single can lead to higher rates of rearrest. But again, in the examples, some had never been married but others didn't. I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nShe has no jobs during the year, which might mean she's looking for work or hasn't found one yet. That could be a risk because if she doesn't have a job, it might lead to more serious issues later on. But in the examples, some had jobs and others didn't. I'm not sure how this plays into recidivism.\n\nShe has used both marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because drug use can be harmful and may contribute to future problems. In the examples, she did use drugs, so maybe that's a significant factor here.\n\nAt her young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban living might have some negative effects on recidivism rates, but I'm not sure how much it affects this specific case. Maybe it's more about where she was raised rather than the individual's circumstances.\n\nPutting all that together: no convictions is a plus, but using drugs and being single or living alone could be negatives. However, in the examples, some had no convictions but others did. This case has no convictions, which is good, but the other factors are mixed. The drug use seems like a big risk factor here.\n\nSo, I think this case might have a moderate risk of rearrest because she's single and hasn't found a job yet, which could lead to more serious issues later. But since she's White with no convictions, maybe it's slightly less likely than someone who has been convicted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"no convictions\", \"low\", \"She has not been convicted of any crime, which is a positive indicator as it reduces the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"single or living alone\", \"medium\", \"Being single or living with a partner can lead to higher rates of rearrest due to potential issues like substance abuse and financial instability\"),\n    (\"no job during the year\", \"medium\", \"A lack of employment history may contribute to more serious problems later, potentially increasing recidivism chances\"),\n    (\"drug use in past four years\", \"high\", \"Drug use can have long-term effects on mental health and behavior, which might affect future outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
