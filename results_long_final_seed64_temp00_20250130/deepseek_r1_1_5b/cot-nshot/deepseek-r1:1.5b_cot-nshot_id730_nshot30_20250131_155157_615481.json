    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the recidivism rate for a specific 21-year-old male based on his risk factors using the provided examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given information about the case:\n\n- **Age**: 21 years old.\n- **Gender**: Male.\n- **Arrest history**: 1 time but not convicted. So, he's currently free.\n- **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n- **Education**: High school diploma and not enrolled in college. So, no higher education.\n- **Employment**: Not mentioned, so I'll assume he's employed or not? Wait, the examples don't specify employment status, but since it's a recidivism prediction, maybe we can infer based on other factors.\n- **Job history**: Not provided, so perhaps this is another factor to consider.\n- **Drug use**: No past four years of drug use. So, no substance abuse issues.\n- **Depression**: Not experienced in depression; he hasn't felt depressed for a month. So, no significant mental health issues.\n- **Family background**: Lived with both biological parents in a rural area. This is important because rural areas might have different social dynamics affecting recidivism.\n\nNow, looking at the provided examples to understand how risk factors are weighted and used to predict recidivism. Each example has multiple risk factors, each assigned a low, medium, or high weight based on their impact on recidivism.\n\nIn the given case:\n\n- **Arrest history**: 1 time but not convicted. This is a minor issue; he's free now.\n- **Marital status**: Currently living alone. This might affect his behavior and decision-making.\n- **Education**: High school diploma, no college. This could mean lower job opportunities or higher turnover rates for those without higher education.\n- **Employment**: Not specified, but if he's employed, that's positive; if not, it might be a risk factor.\n- **Job history**: Not provided, so perhaps this is another factor to consider.\n- **Drug use**: No substance abuse. So, no negative impact on recidivism.\n- **Depression**: Not experienced in depression. So, no significant mental health issues affecting recidivism.\n- **Family background**: Lived with both parents in a rural area. This could mean less support from family or different social dynamics.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights to each factor based on the provided examples:\n\n1. **Marital status (living alone)**: In example #28, someone living alone had a high recidivism rate. So, this is a significant risk factor.\n2. **Education (high school diploma)**: In example #30, someone with a high school diploma had a low recidivism rate. So, lower education might be protective against recidivism.\n3. **Employment**: Not provided, but if he's employed, that's positive; if not, it could be a risk factor. Since the examples don't specify employment status, I'll assume it's positive unless stated otherwise.\n4. **Family background (rural area)**: In example #29, someone from a rural area had a low recidivism rate. So, living in a rural area might have protective effects.\n\nConsidering all these factors:\n\n- Living alone (factor 1) is a significant risk factor with a high weight.\n- Having a high school diploma (factor 3) is protective, so it's medium.\n- Job history and family background (factors 5 and 8) are positive unless specified otherwise. Since they're not provided, I'll assume they don't contribute much.\n\nPutting this together, the recidivism rate should be low because living alone significantly reduces the risk compared to someone who is employed or from a different social environment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone significantly reduces recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Education (high school diploma)\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma may offer some protection against recidivism compared to someone without higher education\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\", \"Not specified, but if employed, positive; otherwise, risk factor\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\", \"Not provided, assumed positive unless stated otherwise\"),\n    (\"Family background (rural area)\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in a rural area may have protective effects\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.3\n}",
