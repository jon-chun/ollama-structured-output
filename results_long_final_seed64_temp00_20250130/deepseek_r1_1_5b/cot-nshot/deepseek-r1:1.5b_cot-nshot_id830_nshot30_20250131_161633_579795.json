    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study of a 21-year-old Hispanic male who is currently living alone, married, with a high school diploma, and has a history of drug use leading to depression. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which adds another layer of risk factors.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant risk factors from the provided examples. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Marital Status**: The case mentions he is married, which is different from the examples where it was stated as \"currently living alone.\" This could be a significant factor because being married might affect his ability to support himself financially or lead to other issues.\n\n2. **High School Diploma and College Enrollment**: In some examples, this wasn't mentioned, but in others like Example 15, he had a high school diploma and was enrolled in college. However, the case here doesn't mention enrollment, so I'll note it as unknown for now.\n\n3. **Job History**: He has held one job during the year, which might indicate some work experience or potential for reentry into the workforce.\n\n4. **Drug Use Leading to Depression**: The user mentioned he used marijuana and felt down, which is a clear indicator of substance use disorder (SUD) leading to depression. This is a strong risk factor because substance abuse can significantly impact mental health.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Family Dynamics**: Being married might affect his ability to support himself or have children, but since the case doesn't mention any children, this isn't directly relevant unless it affects his ability to work or find housing.\n\n6. **Arrests and Convictions**: He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a clear indication of criminal history that could lead to recidivism.\n\nNow, I need to assign weights to each risk factor based on the provided examples. The user mentioned using n-shot examples where each example had multiple factors with their textual reasoning. Since this case has several factors, I'll analyze each one:\n\n- **Marital Status ( married)**: This is a significant factor because being married can lead to financial instability or increased stress, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society. This could be a high risk.\n\n- **High School Diploma and College Enrollment**: Unknown in this case but if he had a diploma and was enrolled, it would be medium. Since he's not mentioned as having an enrollment status, I'll consider it unknown for now.\n\n- **Job History (one job)**: If he had more jobs, it might indicate better support systems or higher likelihood of reentry. But with one job, this is low risk.\n\n- **Drug Use and Depression**: Clear indicators of substance abuse leading to mental health issues. This is a high risk factor because substance use can cause severe depression and worsen mental health problems.\n\n- **Marital Status (currently living alone)**: In the examples, it was \"currently living alone,\" but here it's \"married.\" This could be a significant difference in family dynamics affecting his ability to support himself. This is a high risk factor.\n\nPutting this together, the highest risks are being married and substance use leading to depression. These two factors significantly increase the recidivism risk. The other factors like job history and high school status seem less concerning unless there's more information about them.\n\nConsidering the user's instruction to assign weights based on examples, I'll rate these as medium-high. However, since the case has multiple factors, especially the married status and substance use, they might be higher than others. But without specific weights from examples, it's a bit challenging. I'll assume each major factor is high, but given that being married is more directly tied to financial and family issues, it's medium-high.\n\nFor prediction: Given the significant risks of substance use leading to depression and being married affecting his ability to support himself, this case likely has a higher recidivism risk than average. Therefore, the outcome should be \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"married\", \"medium-high\", \"Being married could lead to financial instability or increased stress, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_leading_to_depression\", \"High\", \"The user mentioned using marijuana and feeling down, indicating substance use disorder (SUD) leading to depression. This is a significant risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
