    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll identify all the risk factors present in the provided information:\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 20 years old.\n2. **Marital Status**: Married with spouse.\n3. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED certificate; not enrolled in college.\n4. **Job History**: Worked for 1 job during the year.\n5. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, feeling down when assessing mental health.\n6. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a small household (size 2) in an urban area.\n7. **Mental Health**: Feeling down after a bad day.\n\nNow, I'll analyze each risk factor against the provided examples to assign weights:\n\n1. **Age (20 years old)**: In Example #31, a 20-year-old female with similar factors had a recidivism rate of 75%, which is moderate. So, medium weight.\n2. **Marital Status**: Example #34 shows a married individual with similar factors having a low recidivism rate (68%), so low weight.\n3. **Education**: The absence of high school diploma and lack of college enrollment in Examples #10, #15, #20, etc., all had moderate rates around 70-75%, so medium weight.\n4. **Job History**: Example #19 shows a moderate rate (68%), so medium weight.\n5. **Drug Use**: The use of drugs and the feeling of downness in Examples #32, #35, etc., had low recidivism rates (60-70%), so low weight.\n6. **Family Background**: Example #14 shows a moderate rate (68%), so medium weight.\n7. **Mental Health**: The assessment of mental health in Examples #36 and others was low (55%), so low weight.\n\nNext, I'll assess the overall risk factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Education: Medium\n- Job History: Medium\n- Drug Use: Low\n- Family Background: Medium\n- Mental Health: Low\n\nNow, considering recidivism rates from similar cases (Examples #10-36), the overall risk seems moderate. However, given that this individual is married and has a low education level, which are factors associated with higher recidivism rates, I'll lean towards a lower probability.\n\nAfter evaluating all factors and their weights, the prediction for rearrest recidivism is likely to be \"NO\" because the combination of these risk factors points to a moderate or lower likelihood of re-arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"A 20-year-old female with similar factors had a moderate recidivism rate of 75%.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"She was married and in a small household, associated with higher rates (68%).\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or college enrollment; moderate recidivism (70-75%)\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Worked for one job during the year; moderate rate (68%).\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used drugs and felt down, associated with lower rates (60-70%)\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a small household; moderate rate (68%).\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \" assessment of mental health was low (55%).\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
