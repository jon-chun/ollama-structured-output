    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll identify the key risk factors in the provided example:\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: The person has been arrested 5 times and convicted.\n2. **Age**: 19 years old.\n3. **Marital Status**: Currently living alone.\n4. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED certificate, not enrolled in college.\n5. **Employment History**: Has held 4 jobs during the year.\n6. **Drug Use**: Has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n7. **Depression/Anxiety**: Feeling down for a month, unable to feel better.\n8. **Household Size**: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2.\n9. **Age Group**: Young adult.\n\nNext, I'll analyze each risk factor against the provided examples to assign weights:\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions (5 times)**: In Example #30, someone with similar factors had recidivism = NO. The weight is medium because they were convicted multiple times and faced significant stress.\n2. **Age (19 years old)**: Not too young or too old, but in other examples, age didn't heavily influence recidivism except when coupled with substance use.\n3. **Marital Status (Living alone)**: In Example #27, someone living alone had recidivism = NO because of stress and lack of support.\n4. **Education**: No diploma or college enrollment. In Example #19, someone without education had recidivism = YES due to substance use and stress.\n5. **Employment History (4 jobs)**: Not the most recent job, but in other examples, employment history didn't strongly correlate with recidivism except when coupled with substance use.\n6. **Drug Use**: Both marijuana and cocaine were used. In Example #29, someone using drugs had recidivism = NO because of stress and mental health issues.\n7. **Depression/Anxiety (Feeling down)**: In the given case, she felt down for a month. In other examples, depression was linked to recidivism, so this is medium.\n8. **Household Size (2 people)**: In Example #30, living with both parents had recidivism = NO because of stress and lack of support.\n9. **Age Group**: Young adult in general doesn't strongly influence recidivism except when coupled with substance use.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on how each factor contributes to recidivism:\n\n- **Arrests/Convictions (5 times)**: Medium\n- **Marital Status (Living alone)**: Medium\n- **Education**: Low (since no diploma or enrollment)\n- **Employment History**: Low (4 jobs, not recent)\n- **Drug Use**: Medium\n- **Depression/Anxiety**: Medium\n- **Household Size**: Low\n- **Age Group**: Low\n\nNext, I'll evaluate each factor in the given case:\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions (5 times)**: High because multiple convictions and stress.\n2. **Marital Status (Living alone)**: Medium due to lack of support.\n3. **Education**: Low as no diploma or enrollment.\n4. **Employment History (4 jobs)**: Low since not recent.\n5. **Drug Use**: Medium, both substances used.\n6. **Depression/Anxiety**: Medium, feeling down for a month.\n7. **Household Size (2 people)**: Low due to small family.\n8. **Age Group**: Young adult, but no significant factors except substance use.\n\nConsidering the weights and evaluations, the person has multiple high-risk factors (arrests, living alone, drug use) and some low ones (education, employment). However, the combination of substance use and stress from depression might lead to recidivism. \n\nBased on the analysis, I'll predict a medium chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"medium\", \"High risk due to multiple convictions and significant stress\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk as living alone leads to stress and lack of support\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Low risk as no diploma or enrollment doesn't correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Low risk as not recent job history doesn't strongly influence recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk due to both substances used and potential stress from depression\"),\n    (\"Depression/Anxiety\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk for feeling down for a month, which can affect mental health and behavior),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Low risk as living with two people leads to minimal support and stress\"),\n    (\"Age Group\", \"low\", \"Young adult in general doesn't strongly influence recidivism except when coupled with substance use\")\n  ],\n  \"outcome\": \"medium\"\n}\n```",
