    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Hispanic male who's married and living with his spouse. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 4 times and convicted. That's a high number of convictions, which is bad because it means he's had multiple issues. But wait, the examples I looked at didn't have such a high number of convictions. The highest was 7 in example #21, so maybe that's not as bad.\n\nNext, his weight is low because he's married and living with his spouse. That might affect his behavior or decision-making. But since he's Hispanic, maybe that has some positive aspects too, like cultural factors influencing recidivism rates.\n\nHe's a 5'9\" man weighing 140 lbs. His height and weight are within normal ranges, so not necessarily bad or good. However, in the examples, males with similar heights had lower recidivism rates, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nHe has one job during the year, which is a bit low, but maybe he's balancing work with his spouse. The past four years of drug use (marijuana) and lack of depression are both negative indicators. But in the examples, people who used drugs had higher recidivism rates, so that might be significant.\n\nHis family size is 4, which isn't too large, but it's also not small. The household is urban, which could mean he has more opportunities or less control over his environment. However, in the examples, urban areas sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates because of job opportunities and education levels.\n\nPutting this all together: high convictions (4), low weight (married/spouse), moderate height/weight, one job, negative drug use and depression, family size 4, urban household. The main issues are high convictions and negative substance use. But in the examples, people with multiple convictions had higher recidivism rates. So maybe that's a red flag.\n\nWait, but in example #21, he was convicted 7 times, which is even higher than this case. Maybe the number of convictions isn't as bad because it's not too high. Also, his weight being low might make him more vulnerable to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nSo overall, despite some negative factors like drug use and living with a spouse, the recidivism rate seems higher than average. Therefore, I'd predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"excessive convictions lead to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"family size\", \"medium\", \"small family sizes may not correlate directly with recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"4-person household might offer more opportunities but could also be less controlled\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"married/spouse status can affect decision-making and behavior\"),\n    (\"drugs used\", \"high\", \"marijuana use is a significant negative factor in recidivism\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"high\", \"lack of depression is another major negative indicator\"),\n    (\"job\", \"moderate\", \"one job may balance work with spouse's responsibilities but could be limiting factors\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
