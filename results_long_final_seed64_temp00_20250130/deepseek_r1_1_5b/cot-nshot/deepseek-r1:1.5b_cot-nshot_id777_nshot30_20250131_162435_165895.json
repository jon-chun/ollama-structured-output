    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the details about the case:\n\n- **Person**: 22-year-old female\n- **Identifies as White**\n- **Arrested once but not convicted**\n- **Weighted: High**\n- **Household size**: 3 (lived with biological mother)\n- **Urban area**\n- **High school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college**\n- **Held two jobs during the year**\n- **Used drugs (marijuana, cocaine)**\n- **Not depressed over the past month**\n- **Lived with both parents in a small family**\n\nNow, I'll go through each risk factor from the provided examples and assign weights based on how they apply to this case.\n\n1. **Arrested once but not convicted**: In Example 28, a Black male with similar details had a recidivism rate of \"YES\". The reasoning was that he had a high school diploma, lived alone, and used drugs. So, this factor is likely high because the person has a stable environment (lived with biological mother) but didn't commit again.\n\n2. **High school diploma and enrolled in college**: In Example 30, a Black male with similar details also had \"YES\". The reasoning was that he held two jobs, used drugs, and lived alone. This suggests that having a high education level and being employed can influence recidivism rates.\n\n3. **Lived with biological mother**: In Example 28, the recidivism rate was \"YES\" because she provided support. Here, living with both parents in a small family might mean more support, which could reduce recidivism.\n\n4. **High school diploma and enrolled in college**: As mentioned earlier, this is high because it's a common factor associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n5. **Not married**: In Example 28, the recidivism rate was \"YES\" as well. Being single can sometimes lead to higher recidivism, but since she lived with her mother, maybe it's more about support than anything else.\n\n6. **Urban area**: In Example 29, a Black male in an urban area had a recidivism rate of \"NO\". This suggests that living in a city might have different factors affecting recidivism compared to rural areas.\n\n7. **High level of education (high school diploma and college enrollment)**: As per Example 30, this factor was high because it's associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n8. **Used drugs**: In Example 29, the recidivism rate was \"NO\" because she used drugs. This supports the idea that drug use can reduce recidivism.\n\n9. **Not depressed over past month**: The reasoning here is that if someone isn't depressed, they might be more motivated to reintegrate into society. So, this factor is likely high as it's a positive trait associated with lower recidivism.\n\n10. **Household size (3 people)**: In Example 29, the recidivism rate was \"NO\" because she lived with both parents in a small family. This suggests that smaller households might provide more support, reducing recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor contributes to lower recidivism rates. The person has a stable environment, high education, no drugs use, and is living with family members. These factors likely make her less likely to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested once but not convicted\", \"high\", \"The case involves a stable environment with support from biological parents, which can influence recidivism rates.\",\n    \"high\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college\", \"high\", \"A common factor associated with lower recidivism rates, especially when supported by family.\",\n    \"high\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother\", \"medium\", \"Stable support from biological parents can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\",\n    \"medium\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college\", \"high\", \"This factor is high because it's associated with lower recidivism rates, especially when supported by family.\",\n    \"high\"),\n    (\"Not married\", \"low\", \"Being single can sometimes lead to higher recidivism, but the case involves being with biological parents.\",\n    \"low\"),\n    (\"Urban area\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area may have different factors affecting recidivism compared to rural areas.\",\n    \"medium\"),\n    (\"High level of education (high school diploma and college enrollment)\", \"high\", \"This factor is high because it's associated with lower recidivism rates, especially when supported by family.\",\n    \"high\"),\n    (\"Used drugs\", \"low\", \"The case involves not using drugs, which supports the idea that motivation can reduce recidivism.\",\n    \"low\"),\n    (\"Not depressed over past month\", \"medium\", \"A positive trait associated with lower recidivism rates, especially when supported by family.\",\n    \"medium\"),\n    (\"Household size (3 people)\", \"low\", \"Stable support from biological parents in a small household can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\",\n    \"low\")\n  ]\n}",
