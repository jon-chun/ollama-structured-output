    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from similar cases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the input means. The case provided has several risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old.\n2. **Gender**: Black.\n3. **Arrest history**: 4 times arrested and convicted.\n4. **Weight**: 5 feet 4 inches (probably not relevant here).\n5. **Height**: 152 lbs (also probably not relevant).\n6. **Marital status**: Not living with a spouse.\n7. **Job history**: No job during the year.\n8. **Drug use**: All time in the past month felt down, no substance use mentioned.\n9. **Household size**: Lived with biological mother in a 2-person household (urban area).\n10. **God's influence**: Considered God has something to do with it.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each example is a case where recidivism was predicted as \"YES\" or \"NO\". The risk factors were analyzed by assigning weights (low, medium, high) based on how they contributed to the outcome in those examples. \n\nFor instance, in Example 10, the person was Black, had a history of arrest and conviction, lived with biological parents in a small household, and felt down about depression. The prediction was \"NO\". This suggests that factors like being Black (maybe), high arrest history, living with parents, feeling depressed, and not having a stable job were considered.\n\nNow, applying this to the current case:\n\n- **Black gender**: Not explicitly mentioned in examples, but from Example 10, Black individuals had negative outcomes. So maybe \"low\" or \"medium\".\n- **Arrest history of 4 times**: More severe than previous examples (which had up to 3 arrests). This might be a high risk factor.\n- **Marital status**: Not living with spouse. In Example 29, someone married and lived with spouse was considered low risk? Or maybe not. Wait, in Example 29, the outcome was \"NO\", but he was married. Hmm, perhaps being single is better. But I'm not sure.\n- **Job history**: No job during the year. In Example 10, someone had a job and still had recidivism. So maybe no job is a high risk factor because it's harder to reintegrate without work.\n- **Depression in the past month**: The case described felt down about depression. In Example 10, this was considered a high risk factor. But in other examples, like Example 29, someone with depression had a negative outcome but was married. So maybe not directly applicable here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- **Arrest history (4 times)**: High.\n- **Marital status**: Not living with spouse. Maybe low because being single is better for reintegration?\n- **Job history**: No job during the year. High risk without work.\n- **Depression in the past month**: High, as it was a significant factor.\n\nSo all these factors are high. Now, looking at examples where multiple high-risk factors were present and outcomes were \"NO\", like Example 10 (all high) and Example 29 (high except for being married). Wait, but in Example 29, the outcome was \"NO\" despite being married. So maybe not just about marital status.\n\nBut since this case is single, that might be a plus. However, other factors are still present.\n\nIn Example 10, all high risk factors led to \"NO\". If multiple high-risk factors lead to \"NO\", then perhaps this case also leads to \"NO\".\n\nAlternatively, if the person was Black (maybe), and had a history of arrest, living with parents in small family, feeling depressed, no job. So maybe it's a mix of high and low.\n\nBut considering that being Black might have some negative impact, but other factors are severe. It's unclear without more examples.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, I'll assign each factor the highest weight (high) because multiple severe risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black gender\", \"medium\", \"High\"),\n    (\"Arrest history of 4 times\", \"high\", \"Very high\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Not living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Low\"),\n    (\"Job history: No job during the year\", \"high\", \"Very high\"),\n    (\"Depression in the past month (feels down)\", \"high\", \"Very high\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
