    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study of a 19-year-old male who is facing rearrest recidivism, and they want to predict the likelihood based on risk factors using examples from previous cases.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors present in the given case. From the description:\n\n- **Arrest history**: 2 times, convicted.\n- **Age**: 19 years old.\n- **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED.\n- **Job history**: Never been married and currently living alone; held one job during the year.\n- **Drug use**: Used marijuana in the past four years, feeling down for a month.\n- **Family background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6 in an urban area.\n\nNow, I'll analyze each risk factor against the provided examples to assign weights. \n\n1. **Arrest history (2 times)**: In Example #30, someone with similar arrest history had recidivism predicted as NO because they were living alone and didn't have a high school diploma. So, low weight.\n2. **Marital status (currently living alone)**: In Example #7, someone who was living alone had recidivism predicted as YES. But since the person is currently living alone, it's similar to that example, so medium weight.\n3. **Education (no high school diploma or GED)**: In Example #10, someone without education and living alone had recidivism as NO. So low weight.\n4. **Job history**: No job history in the case, but in Example #25, someone with no job history was predicted as YES because they were living alone and had a high school diploma. Since this person doesn't have a job history, it's similar to that example, so medium weight.\n5. **Drug use (marijuana)**: In Example #19, someone who used marijuana in the past four years and felt down was predicted as NO because they were living alone and didn't have education. So low weight.\n6. **Family background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6, which is similar to Example #27 where someone with that background had recidivism as NO. So medium weight.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on how each factor aligns with the examples. The weights are low (1), medium (2), and high (3). \n\nNext, I need to evaluate if these risk factors collectively predict recidivism. Looking at the examples, when someone had a high school diploma, they were more likely to be predicted as NO (Example #10). Since this person lacks education, it's a low weight factor contributing to a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nConsidering all factors, especially the lack of education and living alone, which are both low weights, it seems like there's a higher chance of recidivism. However, the arrest history was moderate (low), and the job history is missing, but since they were living alone, that might mitigate some risk. The drug use was also low.\n\nPutting it all together, despite having no education and being living alone, the person didn't have a high school diploma, which in previous examples often led to lower recidivism rates. Therefore, I predict a moderate or low weight for this case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"The arrest history was similar to Example #30 where someone with similar arrest history had recidivism predicted as NO because they were living alone and didn't have education.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone is a common situation in Examples like #7, #10, and #27 which all resulted in low weights for this factor.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED was similar to Example #10 where someone without education and living alone had recidivism as NO.\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"medium\", \"No job history is a common situation in Examples like #25, which resulted in low weights for this factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana was used in the past four years and feeling down for a month was similar to Example #19 where someone with drug use and living alone had recidivism as NO.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6 is similar to Example #27 which resulted in low weights for this factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
