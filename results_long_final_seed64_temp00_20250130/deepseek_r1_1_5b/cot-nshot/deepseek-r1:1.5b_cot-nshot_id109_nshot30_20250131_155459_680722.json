    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study about a 22-year-old Black male who is married and currently living with his spouse. He's facing potential rearrest recidivism, and we need to predict the outcome based on several risk factors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given information:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old.\n2. **Marital Status**: Married and currently living with his spouse.\n3. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED certificate; not enrolled in college.\n4. **Employment History**: Not employed during the past four years, but he has two jobs during the year.\n5. **Drug Use**: Has not used any drugs in the past four years and feels down when he's depressed.\n6. **Household Size**: Lived in a household of size 8 at a young age.\n7. **Genders**: Black gender.\n\nNow, I need to analyze each risk factor with weights: low, medium, high. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Marital Status (Married)**: The examples provided show that being married can be a significant risk. For instance, in Example 29, someone who is married and living with his spouse has a recidivism rate of \"NO\". This suggests that marital status is a high-risk factor because it often leads to issues like substance abuse or emotional instability.\n\n2. **Education (No High School)**: In the examples, people without a high school diploma have higher recidivism rates. For example, in Example 15 and 16, individuals with no high school diploma had lower recidivism rates compared to those with a high school diploma. So, not having a high school diploma is a high-risk factor.\n\n3. **Employment History (Not Employed)**: The examples don't provide direct data on employment history, but since the person has two jobs during the year, it might indicate some level of job stability or stress. However, without specific data, it's hard to assign a weight. But considering that having multiple jobs can lead to stress and substance use, this could be a high-risk factor.\n\n4. **Drug Use (No History)**: The person has not used drugs in the past four years but feels down when depressed. This indicates emotional instability due to substance use, which is a significant risk factor. So, drug use is likely a high-risk factor.\n\n5. **Household Size (8)**: Lived in an 8-person household at a young age. The examples don't specify how household size affects recidivism, but larger households might have more stressors and potential for substance abuse or emotional issues. This could be a high-risk factor.\n\n6. **Gender (Black)**: In the examples, Black individuals sometimes face higher recidivism rates. For instance, in Example 27, someone of Black origin had lower recidivism compared to others. However, without specific data on Black individuals, it's hard to assign a weight. But given that Black people often face higher risks due to systemic issues, this could be a high-risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- **Marital Status (High)**: High risk.\n- **Education (High)**: High risk.\n- **Employment History (Medium)**: Medium risk.\n- **Drug Use (High)**: High risk.\n- **Household Size (High)**: High risk.\n- **Gender (High)**: High risk.\n\nThe highest weight is for marital status, followed by education and gender. Employment history isn't provided with a clear weight, so I'll assign it a medium. Drug use is high because of the emotional instability due to substance use.\n\nNext, I need to assess how these factors collectively predict recidivism. The person is married (high), has no high school diploma (high), has two jobs (medium), hasn't used drugs in four years but feels down when depressed (high), and lives in an 8-person household (high). \n\nMarital status being high suggests significant stress, which can lead to substance abuse or depression. High education and gender indicate systemic issues that contribute to recidivism. The lack of employment history isn't clear, but the presence of multiple jobs might add some stress. Drug use is a strong indicator of emotional instability.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it's highly likely that this person will rearrest. Therefore, the prediction should be \"YES\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Married individuals often face higher recidivism rates due to stress and emotional instability.\",\n    \"High\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates systemic issues contributing to recidivism.\",\n    \"High\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Not employed during the past four years but having two jobs may add stressors.\",\n    \"Medium\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"No history of drug use but feelings of depression when depressed suggest emotional instability.\",\n    \"High\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"high\", \"Lived in an 8-person household at a young age, adding potential stressors.\",\n    \"High\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\"\n}\n```",
