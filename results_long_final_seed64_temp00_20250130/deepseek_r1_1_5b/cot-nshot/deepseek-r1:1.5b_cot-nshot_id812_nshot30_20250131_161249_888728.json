    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the recidivism rate for a specific case using given risk factors and examples from similar cases. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the input means. The user provided a detailed example with 30 risk factors and corresponding outcomes. Each factor has a weight (low, medium, high) based on how they contribute to recidivism. My job is to analyze the given case against these examples.\n\nThe case in question is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once and convicted, weighs 185 lbs, never married, currently living alone, has a high school diploma, is enrolled in college, has held two jobs, hasn't used drugs, doesn't feel depressed, and lived with non-biological parents in a household of four.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I notice that factors like being White (low), having a high school diploma (medium), holding multiple jobs (medium), living alone (medium), and not feeling depressed (medium) are associated with lower recidivism rates. On the other hand, factors like being Black (high), having a history of arrests (medium), and living in foster care (medium) are linked to higher recidivism.\n\nIn this case, the individual is White, which aligns with lower recidivism. He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, so that's medium. Holding two jobs suggests some stability, also medium. Living alone is a factor that can influence behavior, maybe low or medium. Not feeling depressed is important; if he was depressed before, it might affect recidivism.\n\nThe key factors here are his race (White), education level (high but not college), job history (two jobs), living situation (alone), and mental health (not depressed). These all seem to contribute to lower recidivism. Comparing this case with the examples where similar factors led to lower outcomes, it's likely that this individual has a lower risk of rearrest.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, I think the prediction is \"NO\" because his profile suggests he's less likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"White\", \"low\", \"White individuals are generally associated with lower recidivism rates due to stable social support and fewer criminal history issues.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma can influence behavior, but since he's not in college, it might still contribute to lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Two jobs\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs suggest some financial stability and possibly less criminal activity due to varied circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Lived with non-biological parents in a household of four\", \"low\", \"Living alone or with foster/adoptive parents can influence behavior, potentially reducing recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Not depressed before\", \"medium\", \"Mental health is crucial; if he was depressed previously, it might affect his decision to reoffend.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
