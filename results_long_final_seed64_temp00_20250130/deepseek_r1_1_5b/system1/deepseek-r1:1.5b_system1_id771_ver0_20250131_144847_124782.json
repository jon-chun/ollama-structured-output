    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or traits that might affect criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and has been convicted. This is a strong indicator of past criminal history, which usually carries a high risk label. However, the number of arrests versus convictions can vary depending on the context, so it's important to consider that he might have some recidivism or not.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 160 lbs. While physical attributes can influence behavior, I don't recall any specific studies linking height directly to criminal risk. It might be a factor but probably not the main one here.\n\nHe's 22 years old, which is relatively young for someone who has been convicted three times. This could indicate some level of recidivism or potential issues that might affect his behavior in the future.\n\nHis weight is 160 lbs, which seems on the lower side. I'm not sure how this relates to criminal risk factors, but it's something to consider.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. This could mean he has a certain level of independence or potential vulnerabilities if he gets into trouble. However, being single might also indicate some stress or strain on his relationships, which could be a factor in criminal behavior.\n\nHis education is a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. This suggests that he's at least somewhat educated and may have some academic background, which can sometimes influence criminal behavior. But it's not the most direct indicator of risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years or felt depressed over the past month. These are serious issues that could significantly impact someone's mental health and behavior. If he has substance abuse problems or feelings of depression, this could be a high-risk factor.\n\nAt 22, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size two. This is a common situation for young adults, but it doesn't inherently indicate criminal risk unless there are specific patterns of behavior that have been observed before.\n\nHe considers God to have nothing to do with his personal life. While this could be a significant factor if it affects his mental health or relationships, it's not directly related to criminal behavior unless there's an underlying belief in theism that impacts decision-making.\n\nPutting all these factors together, while he has some recidivism history and hasn't used drugs, especially since he's 22, other factors like living alone, substance abuse, and possibly his family dynamics could be significant. However, without more specific information on how these factors have affected him in the past or any patterns of behavior that might indicate future issues, it's a bit challenging to assign an exact risk level.\n\nI think he does have some high-risk elements because of his age, weight, education, and living situation, but I'm not entirely sure. It might be better to err on the side of caution and consider him as having high risk factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
