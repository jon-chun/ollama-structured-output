    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors presented and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not immediately alarming, but it's something to note. He has been arrested five times and convicted, which is significant. Each arrest carries a substantial sentence, so five could add up quickly.\n\nNext, he's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That's within the average range for his age, so not concerning me here.\n\nHis marital status is never married, which might affect his relationships but doesn't inherently indicate a risk factor. He's currently living alone, which could be a concern if he's struggling financially or has other issues.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 2 inches short, which is unusual for his age. That might raise some red flags about height-related health issues or potential body image problems.\n\nHis weight range suggests he's in the average to lower end of his age group, so not a high risk factor on that front.\n\nHe has never been married but is currently living alone. This could be a significant issue if he's struggling financially or has other personal challenges. It might lead to isolation and stress.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches tall and 174 pounds, which is slightly above average for his height. While not necessarily high risk, it's something to consider.\n\nHis weight range suggests he's in the lower end of his age group, so no immediate concern here.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. That might indicate some academic challenges or lack of motivation, which could be a risk factor if he's struggling with education.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and most of that time during the past month he's felt down in the dumps. This is concerning because feeling so low in the dumps can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. It might indicate underlying stress or emotional problems.\n\nHis family includes both biological parents, living with them in an urban area, and considers God involved. While this could be a positive sign if he's seeking spiritual guidance, it doesn't directly indicate a high risk factor unless there are specific concerns about his mental state or relationships.\n\nPutting all these together, the main issues seem to revolve around his weight, height, living alone, feeling down in the dumps, and possibly some underlying stress. These could lead to anxiety, depression, or other health problems. However, without more context on how he's coping with those feelings, it's hard to say if they're high risk.\n\nI think these factors do indicate a potential high risk because of the emotional distress and possible mental health issues associated with feeling down in the dumps. It could lead to increased stress, anxiety, and other health problems.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
