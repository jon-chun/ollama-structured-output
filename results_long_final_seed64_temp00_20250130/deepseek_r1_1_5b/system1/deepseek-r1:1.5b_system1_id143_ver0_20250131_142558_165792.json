    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means she might have some underlying issues that could lead to recidivism.\n\nShe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 155 lbs. That seems about right for her age, so no immediate risk factors here. Her marital status is never married, and she's living alone now. That's a significant factor because being single can increase the risk of reoffending due to lack of support networks.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree but isn't enrolled in college. This could mean she hasn't completed her education yet or might be pursuing it part-time. A higher level of education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this could be a positive sign if she continues her studies.\n\nShe's been employed for four jobs and hasn't taken any further education. That suggests she's not seeking employment beyond what she has, which might indicate instability or lack of support. This could lead to higher risk because she might struggle with finding work or facing job-related issues.\n\nHer past behavior includes using drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and feeling down for a few months that nothing could cheer her up. This is concerning because drug use can be a serious issue, especially if it's related to mental health. The emotional distress she's experiencing might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe's raised by parents who lived together in a household of size 4 in an urban area. That's not inherently bad, but living with others could provide some support and reduce stress, which is generally associated with lower risk. However, if the family dynamics are strained or problematic, it might increase the risk.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal issues. This seems concerning because it suggests she may be influenced by external factors rather than internal circumstances. External influences can sometimes lead to recidivism as they might affect her mental health and behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, while some factors like drug use and emotional distress are red flags, the other factors like being single, not pursuing education further, and living in a family of four suggest potential support systems that could mitigate risk. However, the lack of support for her past behavior and the influence from God raise concerns about her mental health and stability.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
