    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That seems okay because gender and race aren't typically high-risk factors in criminal justice assessments unless there are specific circumstances mentioned. She has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning. Being a minor could also pose risks if they're not fully supervised or have other issues.\n\nShe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 135 lbs. That doesn't seem like an extreme weight for her age, so that might be manageable. Her height isn't a major risk factor either.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Marital status can affect criminal behavior because of family dynamics, but since she hasn't been married yet, it might not pose immediate risks unless there are specific issues like domestic violence or neglect.\n\nHer weight is 135 lbs, which isn't a significant health risk on its own. She's a high school diploma and not in college, so education level isn't an issue here. She's lived with a household of size 3 for the past five years, but that doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk unless there are specific circumstances.\n\nShe has held 5 jobs during the year, which is unusual because typically, someone holds one job at a time. This could be problematic if they're not maintaining a stable schedule or if it affects their mental health.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to serious issues like addiction, mental health problems, and criminal behavior. Not feeling depressed might be manageable unless there are underlying stressors that could contribute to substance use or mental health.\n\nShe's living at a young age in a household of size 3, which is unusual because typically, people live with two others. This could indicate neglect or abuse if she's not being properly supervised or if the family dynamics aren't stable.\n\nLastly, she considers God has something to do with her personal issues. While this is interesting, it doesn't directly translate into high-risk factors unless there are specific religious beliefs or circumstances that tie into criminal behavior, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting all these together, while some factors like drug use and household living might raise concerns, the person hasn't shown signs of abuse, neglect, or mental health issues. However, the number of arrests and convictions is a clear indicator of high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
