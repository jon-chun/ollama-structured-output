    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk for an 18-year-old male based on the given JSON structure.\n\nFirst, looking at his age: he's 18, which is within legal age limits. He identifies as White, which doesn't inherently pose a risk unless there are specific issues like racial discrimination or identity-based crime, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted, which could indicate criminal behavior. However, the context isn't clear whether this relates to his age or other factors like race or socioeconomic status.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, which is within average for an 18-year-old. Weight of 135 lbs is also normal for that age group. His marital status is never married, and he's living alone, which might affect his mental health if he's dealing with issues like substance abuse.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which could be a red flag because many criminal records are linked to education levels. He's not enrolled in college either, so that adds another layer of risk.\n\nHis job history is never mentioned, but he has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't been clean for at least a month. This drug use could be concerning because it might indicate substance abuse or dependency, which can lead to criminal behavior if not addressed properly.\n\nHe's from a rural area with six family members, which is less likely to affect his criminal behavior unless there are specific factors like poverty or unemployment that aren't mentioned here.\n\nHis living situation as an 18-year-old in a rural area might have some social implications, but again, without more context on his background, it's hard to assess risk.\n\nPutting this together, the main risks seem to be his past drug use and substance abuse history. However, since he's from a rural area with possibly less resources, there could be additional factors contributing to his risk. But overall, these elements do indicate some level of risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
