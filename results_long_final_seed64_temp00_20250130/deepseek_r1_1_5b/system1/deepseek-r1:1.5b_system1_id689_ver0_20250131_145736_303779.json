    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided information and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is concerning because it could lead to serious legal issues. His height of 5 feet 6 inches and weight of 130 lbs are within normal ranges for his age.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might indicate a lack of social support. However, he's living in an urban area with his biological father, where he considers God to have something to do with his life. This could be interpreted as seeking divine guidance or purpose, which is unusual at this age. His high school diploma isn't pursued beyond that, and he's not enrolled in college, so he might lack the academic background needed for higher education.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year and used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time since then, feeling down in the dumps. This drug use is concerning because it could lead to addiction or mental health issues. His current living situation with his biological father might have influenced his behavior, but he's not seeking help for addiction.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his life, which is unusual and could indicate a lack of personal accountability or a belief in divine influence over his actions. This might lead to questions about how he handles his issues, especially since he's been arrested.\n\nPutting this all together, the arrest history, drug use, and consideration of God as a factor are significant. These could raise red flags about potential mental health issues, addiction risks, or lack of accountability. However, without more context on his criminal record beyond one arrest, it's hard to say definitively if he's at high risk.\n\nI think the overall assessment leans towards high risk because of the arrest history and drug use, which are serious concerns. The other factors like living alone, lack of education, and consideration of God might contribute but aren't definitive indicators.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
