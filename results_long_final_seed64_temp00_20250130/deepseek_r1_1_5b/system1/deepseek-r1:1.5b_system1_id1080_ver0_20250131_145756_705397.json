    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might indicate some underlying issues or potential biases that could affect his behavior. But I'm not sure how significant this is yet.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's pretty serious. Two arrests are already concerning, especially if they're related to the same crime. Conviction adds another layer of concern. But I don't know the specifics of what those crimes were or why he was convicted.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 210 lbs. That seems normal for a 21-year-old, but maybe not too tall or too heavy. Doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nHis height is 6'4\" which is about 193 cm, so that's within the average range. His weight of 210 lbs is also typical for his age and gender. So no immediate risk from physical attributes here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That could be a red flag because being single might lead to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, especially if he's young. But I'm not sure how severe this is yet.\n\nHis family size is 7, which isn't too large, but it's also not small. He has a high school diploma and is in college, so he's educated enough for his age. That might indicate some potential issues with education or skill level, but again, not sure about the risk assessment here.\n\nHe's been employed once during the year, which could be concerning if he's involved in drug-related activities. But I don't know how often he's worked or what kind of job it was. It's possible, but maybe not a high risk factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems like a lot of information to piece together. Using marijuana is serious, especially if it's related to his criminal history. Not feeling depressed might be a red flag, but I'm not sure how significant that is without more context.\n\nHe lives in an urban area with a household of size 7 and considers God involved. That could mean he's seeking some spiritual or moral guidance, which might lead him astray. But again, it's speculative and not concrete evidence of a high risk factor.\n\nPutting all this together: He's young, Black, has criminal history, is single, educated, has substance use issues, and is living in an urban area with a family size that could be concerning. The arrest record and his involvement in drug-related activities are strong indicators of potential risks. However, without more specific details about the crimes or his behavior, it's hard to quantify the confidence level.\n\nI think he might have some underlying issues related to his criminal history, especially since he's a Black person. But I'm not sure if that translates directly into high risk factors for someone his age and with a family size of 7. It could be a red flag, but it's also possible that the risks are manageable.\n\nSo, my prediction is YES because there are significant risk factors, especially regarding his criminal history and substance use. The confidence level would be moderate to high since while some concerns exist, others might be more manageable.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
