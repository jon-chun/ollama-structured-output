    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race, but I'm not sure how that directly affects his criminal behavior. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a bit concerning because it means he could be facing legal consequences.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. That seems normal for a 22-year-old, so no immediate risk factors here. His height is within the average range, and his weight isn't too high either.\n\nHe's never been married or engaged, living alone, and hasn't had any jobs during the year. This suggests he might be looking for work but hasn't started yet. That could lead to some stress or uncertainty about his future, which might affect criminal behavior.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's a significant lack of education, especially since many people with similar background history face higher risks due to inadequate training or resources. This could be a red flag for criminal activity.\n\nHe has never been married but now is living alone. That might indicate he's looking for a partner, which could lead to issues like substance abuse or emotional problems if he can't find someone else. His past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years and some time feeling down in the dumps during the past month are serious concerns. He used substances in the past year, which is concerning.\n\nHe's from a household of size 3 with adults other than biological parents, foster or adoptive parents. That means he might have less support system compared to someone raised by two parents. This could lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about his future, which might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHis race identity as Black is interesting because it's often associated with issues like poverty, discrimination, and substance abuse. However, I'm not sure how that directly affects his criminal history without more context on his background.\n\nPutting this all together, the lack of education, lack of support system, past drug use, and current emotional state (feeling down in the dumps) are strong indicators of high risk. The other factors like age, weight, living alone, and no significant past crimes don't seem to add up to a high risk scenario.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
