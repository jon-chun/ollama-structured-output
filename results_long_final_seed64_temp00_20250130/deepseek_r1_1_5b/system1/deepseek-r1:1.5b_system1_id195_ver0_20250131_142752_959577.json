    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or mental health issues, but I'm not sure if that directly indicates high risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Four arrests is a lot for someone under 30, especially in the criminal justice system. Convictions could indicate past behavior that's problematic, which might lead to higher risk now.\n\nHis height of 5 feet 9 inches and weight of 140 lbs are within normal ranges for his age. It doesn't raise any red flags about health or mental state.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marital issues can sometimes affect someone's mental health, but again, I'm not sure if that's a high risk indicator here.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma, which isn't enough for college enrollment. This might indicate some underlying issues related to education or work history, but it's still on the lower side.\n\nHe has held one job during the past year and hasn't mentioned any changes in his employment status. If he was working before, that could be concerning if there were previous issues with his job performance or mental health.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't reported feeling depressed over the past month. Using substances can sometimes lead to mental health problems, but it's not clear if this is a high risk factor here.\n\nAt 22, he lived with both of his biological parents in an urban household of size four. This could be part of his upbringing or previous experiences that might influence current behavior. It doesn't necessarily indicate high risk, though it's something to consider.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. While this is a common belief among many, it doesn't directly translate into high-risk indicators in the criminal justice system context.\n\nPutting all these together, while he has some concerning factors like past arrests and substance use, they might not be enough to indicate a high risk of criminal behavior at this age. However, his background as a Hispanic male could raise some red flags about mental health or family dynamics that might contribute to future issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
