    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be concerning because sometimes arrests can lead to convictions if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 165 lbs. That seems about right for a 19-year-old, so not an issue here. She's never been married and is living alone now. That might be concerning because being single can lead to issues with family support, especially if she has children or has a significant impact on the household.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. That means she hasn't completed high school yet, which could indicate some level of dependency or lack of independence. High school diplomas are often associated with lower risk factors because they're considered more stable, but it's something to note.\n\nShe's been holding one job during the year and has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's a lot of substance use history. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug that can lead to severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which could be dangerous.\n\nShe's currently living alone, which might mean she doesn't have family support for children or other responsibilities. This could put additional stress on her and make it harder to handle substance abuse without professional help.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal life. That's interesting because it suggests a spiritual aspect to her behavior. However, I'm not sure how significant this is in terms of risk assessment unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems that stem from religious beliefs.\n\nShe's 19 years old, which is relatively young for someone who has used drugs four years ago. This could indicate a lack of maturity or the ability to handle substance use without professional help. It might also suggest that she hasn't had enough time to develop coping strategies.\n\nShe's raised by her biological parents in an urban household of size 4. Urban living can be stressful, especially if there are concerns about safety or community issues. However, this doesn't inherently indicate a high risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nOverall, the key risk factors here seem to include substance use history (cocaine), lack of family support, and possibly underlying mental health issues due to substance use. These could lead to serious consequences if not addressed promptly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
