    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. So, there's some uncertainty about the outcome of his arrest. I should note that.\n\nHe's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That seems reasonable for a 19-year-old, so no immediate risk factors here. His height is typical for his age, so not a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That might be concerning because being single can lead to issues with family support, especially if he has children or needs to provide for them. But since he hasn't mentioned anything about children yet, it's still something to watch out for.\n\nHis household size is 4 people, and he considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This seems a bit concerning because it suggests there might be some spiritual or divine influence affecting his behavior. I should note this as a potential risk factor.\n\nHe's not been married but is living alone, which could lead to issues like dependency on family members for support and resources. That's definitely something to consider in terms of risk factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This might indicate that he hasn't attended any formal education beyond high school, which could be a concern if it affects his ability to handle the stress or responsibility associated with being 19 years old. However, since he's not currently in college, maybe this is less of an issue.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year and used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. This could be concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues or addiction problems. I should note that as a potential risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but he's been using drugs for the past four years. While not feeling depressed is positive, the recent drug use and dependency could still pose risks. So, this might be a low confidence point because it shows some level of substance abuse without necessarily indicating immediate mental health issues.\n\nHe lives in a rural area with his biological parents and considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This seems like a significant concern because it suggests there's an underlying spiritual or divine influence affecting his behavior, which could lead to serious consequences if not addressed. I should note this as a high risk factor.\n\nOverall, the person is 19 years old, has some substance abuse history, and lives in a rural area with a family of four. These factors together suggest there's a higher chance of him being at risk for various issues such as addiction, dependency, mental health problems, or spiritual influences affecting his behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
