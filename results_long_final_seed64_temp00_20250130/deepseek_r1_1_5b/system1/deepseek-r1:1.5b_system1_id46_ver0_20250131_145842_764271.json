    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So, he's facing some kind of criminal charge or offense. That could be concerning because it might indicate potential criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 287 lbs. That seems about right for a 21-year-old, so no immediate physical issues here. His height is typical for his age, so that doesn't raise any red flags either.\n\nHis household size is 4, which isn't too large, but it's also not small. He's living alone, which might be a bit unusual, especially if he has children or needs to share space with others. However, since he's 21 and hasn't had kids yet, maybe that's manageable.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That could indicate some level of education, but it might also mean he's at a younger age than the average person who has completed education. This could be a concern because it might affect his ability to handle criminal behavior or make decisions on his own.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 for a few years. That's unusual, especially if he's just starting out. It might have been a difficult adjustment period, but I don't see anything immediately concerning about that.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive indicators because they show he's managing his emotions and doesn't exhibit signs of substance abuse or mental health issues. That's good to know.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban living can be stressful, especially if it's for the first time. It might have been challenging, but again, not something that stands out as high risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he's arrested once, which is possible but concerning because it could indicate criminal behavior or a serious offense. He's 21, which might mean he's more likely to engage in delinquent behavior compared to younger adults. The household size and living alone are unusual for his age, but that's not necessarily a high risk unless there's some underlying issue.\n\nHis lack of education and college enrollment could be a red flag if he's at an older age or if it affects his ability to make decisions on his own. However, since he's 21, it might still be manageable with support from family and friends.\n\nThe positive aspects like no substance abuse and no depression are reassuring. They show that he's in good mental and emotional health, which is a plus for risk assessment purposes.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the person has some potential criminal behavior due to being arrested once but hasn't been convicted. The lack of education and college enrollment might be a concern if it affects his ability to handle criminal behavior or make decisions on his own. However, since he's 21, it's not an immediate red flag. The other factors are more positive and don't indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
