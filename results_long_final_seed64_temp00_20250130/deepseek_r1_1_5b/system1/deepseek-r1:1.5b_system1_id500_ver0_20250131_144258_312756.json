    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might indicate some underlying issues or experiences that could affect criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how significant this is yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear sign of past actions that could lead to legal consequences. However, if she's just recently released, maybe the risk isn't as high as it seems.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight 130 lbs. These are average measurements for her age, so I don't think this adds much to the risk assessment.\n\nShe hasn't been married yet and is living alone. Single individuals might face different legal challenges compared to those who are already married or in a relationship. But again, not sure how that affects criminal behavior.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This could mean she's working or has some professional experience, which might influence her criminal history. However, it's not the most significant factor on its own.\n\nShe hasn't been involved in any substance use within the past four years\u2014she used marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, so this is a notable risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health issues are important, feeling depressed might not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there's a connection between the two.\n\nLiving in a rural area with her biological mother in a household of size 9. This could mean she has limited access to resources or support systems that might contribute to criminal behavior. Rural living can be isolating and affect mental health, which are both risk factors.\n\nConsidering that she identifies as Black, it's possible there are underlying issues related to race, but this is more of a stereotype than actual evidence. It doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there's a connection between race and past actions.\n\nPutting all these together: She has a history of substance abuse, which is a clear risk factor. However, the other factors like living in a rural area or being single might not be as significant on their own. The overall risk seems moderate but elevated because of her substance use history.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
