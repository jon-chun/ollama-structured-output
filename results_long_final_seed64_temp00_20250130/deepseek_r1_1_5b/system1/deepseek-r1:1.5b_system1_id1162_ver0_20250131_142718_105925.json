    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Hispanic female. That's not too bad in terms of race, but it might be a concern because some communities have higher rates of crime or substance abuse. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because sometimes people are arrested without being convicted, which can indicate serious issues. However, if the arrest was for something like domestic violence or a minor offense, it might be less concerning. Still, it's something to note.\n\nHer height and weight aren't too extreme\u20145 feet 5 inches and 125-149 lbs. That seems normal, but maybe in some areas, this range is more common than others. I'm not sure how that affects risk assessment.\n\nShe hasn't been married yet, which might mean she's single or has a partner elsewhere. Single individuals are generally considered less risky because they don't have the stress of living with someone else. But if she's in a relationship outside her immediate circle, that could be a concern. I'm not sure about this one.\n\nShe's currently not living alone and is part of a household of size four. That means she has friends or family around her, which might reduce some risks associated with living alone. But it doesn't necessarily mean she's safe; it just changes the dynamics.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma but isn't in college. That could be an issue if she hasn't attended college, especially if that was part of her previous education or if there are gaps in her knowledge. It might affect job opportunities later on.\n\nShe's not enrolled in college, which means she might have some work experience or skills that could help her in the future. But without a degree, she might face higher costs and more challenges in the workforce. That's something to consider.\n\nShe has held one job during the past year. If that was a significant role, it could indicate serious issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. But if it was just a regular job, maybe less so. I'm not sure about this yet.\n\nHer drug use history is interesting\u2014she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to serious health issues and mental health problems. It might indicate underlying stress or trauma from previous experiences.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. But it doesn't necessarily mean she won't face future challenges related to her drug use history or other issues.\n\nShe's raised by God, but that seems like a stereotype and not specific to this individual. It might be a red flag if someone identifies as Hispanic and has such beliefs, but I'm not sure how significant that is in this context.\n\nHer living situation\u2014living with adults from the past in an urban area\u2014is concerning because it could indicate stress or strain on her mental health. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and other stressors, which might affect her well-being.\n\nPutting all these together, some factors like substance abuse history and living with others are significant risks. However, since she's a 20-year-old, maybe the impact isn't as severe as in older individuals. But given that she hasn't been convicted yet, it's still concerning. I think this indicates high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
