    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's a positive sign because Hispanic communities are generally safe in many ways. But I should consider any potential biases or specific risks associated with that identity.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. This is concerning because being arrested can lead to serious legal issues, which might affect his mental health. However, if he's serving time, it could also be a positive outcome. I need to look at the context of his arrest\u2014when did he commit the crimes? If they were minor offenses or related to his life circumstances, it might not be as severe.\n\nHe is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 260 lbs. That's within the healthy weight range for his height, so physical health isn't a major concern here.\n\nHis age is 21, which is on the younger side, but since he's Hispanic, that could mitigate some risks associated with youth. However, I should consider if there are any specific risks tied to being in his early years or living alone.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can be risky because it increases the risk of domestic violence, which is a serious issue. Additionally, living alone might lead to feelings of isolation, which could affect mental health.\n\nHis weight is 260 lbs, which is within the healthy range for his height, so that's not a significant concern.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. That means he may have some work experience or skills, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher risk level unless there are specific issues related to education or skill gaps.\n\nHe has held one job during the year and used marijuana in the past four years. Using marijuana is illegal and can lead to severe emotional distress. The fact that he's been using it for four years adds significant stress, which could be a high risk factor.\n\nAdditionally, he has felt down in the dumps (D.E.P.) at times, especially during the past month. This indicates feelings of despair or low self-esteem, which is a serious concern and can lead to mental health issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nHis background includes living with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area. That might have some social risks associated with being in a small community, but it's not inherently high risk unless there are specific concerns about the environment or family dynamics.\n\nOverall, while he has some positive aspects like being Hispanic and having a stable background, the recent use of marijuana, feelings of despair, living alone, and possibly living in an urban area could all contribute to higher risk factors. The significant use of marijuana over four years is particularly concerning because it can lead to severe emotional and psychological effects.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
