    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be concerning because sometimes arrests can lead to convictions if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nShe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That seems about right for a young adult, so not high risk here.\n\nHer height is 5'7\", which is above average for her age, but again, that doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. That could be a concern if she's dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues because being single might lead to isolation, especially if she's not in a committed relationship.\n\nHer weight range suggests she's active physically, which is fine, but again, no immediate red flags.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. That could be an issue if she hasn't attended school properly or if there are gaps in her education that might affect her ability to handle substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nShe's not currently enrolled in college, which is something to note because it might indicate potential academic challenges or lack of proper education, which could impact her ability to manage substance use and mental health.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs during the year. That's a bit broad; she could have worked anywhere, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk unless there are specific issues with those jobs that aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems more concerning because substance abuse can lead to severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which could be dangerous if not properly managed.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. That's a bit unusual for someone who has been arrested but hasn't been convicted yet. It might indicate that she's dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues and is looking for support from family members.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This could be concerning because it suggests she's not seeking help from others, which might lead to isolation and potential harm if she doesn't get the support she needs.\n\nPutting all these together: She's a 20-year-old arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She's single, has substance abuse issues, and is living alone. The lack of education could be an issue. She's not in a committed relationship, which might lead to isolation if she's struggling with substance use or mental health. The fact that she's lived with her parents in a rural area suggests she's seeking support from family members but hasn't gotten it yet. The lack of college enrollment and the weight range don't immediately indicate high risk, but the other factors do.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think this person does have some high-risk elements, especially regarding substance abuse, mental health issues, and potential isolation without proper support.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
