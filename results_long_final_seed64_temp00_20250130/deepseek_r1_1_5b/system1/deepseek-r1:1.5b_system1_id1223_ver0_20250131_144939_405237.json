    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk for an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. That's a significant racial identity, which might raise concerns about race relations in society. I remember reading that racial tensions can lead to issues like discrimination and violence, so this could be a red flag.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. While arrest is a serious issue, not being convicted doesn't necessarily mean she's committing a crime. It just means she's facing legal consequences. However, if she's been arrested before, it might indicate some underlying issues that could lead to criminal behavior in the future.\n\nShe's 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 219 lbs. That seems about right for an 18-year-old, so no immediate physical health concerns here. She's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a significant stressor, especially if she's dealing with mental health issues or other personal challenges.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate that she hasn't developed the necessary skills for higher education, which might lead to criminal behavior later on. However, it's not impossible for someone without formal education to become involved in criminal activities if they're motivated enough.\n\nShe has never been married but is living alone. That's a tough spot because being single can be emotionally challenging and may contribute to mental health issues that could lead to criminal behavior. The fact that she's lived with both biological parents in a household of size six in a rural area might also indicate some stress or challenges from family life.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and some of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious health problems and mental health issues. The emotional state described seems like a significant trigger for criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a rural area. This might have contributed to some stress or challenges from family life, especially if they were involved in criminal activities or had personal issues.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the person's racial identity, past arrest without conviction, living alone, lack of education, and drug use seem like serious concerns that could lead to criminal behavior. The high risk assessment would likely flag this individual for further investigation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
