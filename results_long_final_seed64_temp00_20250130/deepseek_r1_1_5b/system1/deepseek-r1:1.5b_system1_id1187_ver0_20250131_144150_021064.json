    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because race can sometimes be a sign of potential issues, but it doesn't automatically mean he's at risk. I should consider other factors more than just his race.\n\nHe has been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. This is concerning because being arrested without conviction can lead to serious legal issues. However, if the arrest was due to a minor offense or something manageable, maybe it's less severe. But since he's 22 and hasn't been convicted yet, that's a red flag.\n\nHe's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs over 250 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for his age, but again, weight alone isn't a clear indicator of risk. I should look at other factors more carefully.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Marrying someone can lead to complications like family issues or emotional strain, which might affect criminal behavior. Living alone could also contribute to mental health issues that might impact his ability to commit crimes.\n\nHis education level: He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This is concerning because lack of education can lead to criminal behavior if there's no support system. However, it's not the only factor here; other factors like substance abuse also come into play.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year but hasn't used any drugs in the past four years or some time in the last month he felt down. This is a strong indicator of substance abuse. Even though he's 22, substance use can be a serious issue regardless of age. It's important to note that this includes not just current use but also past behavior.\n\nHe considers living with his biological mother in a household of size five and has a God connection. While being raised by his biological parent is a positive aspect, it doesn't automatically make someone at risk. However, the mention of a God connection might raise some concerns about mental health or personal struggles that could affect criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: He's arrested without conviction (high), has substance abuse issues (very high), and has a history of living alone with no support system. These factors are significant enough to indicate high risk, especially considering his age and the lack of education.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
