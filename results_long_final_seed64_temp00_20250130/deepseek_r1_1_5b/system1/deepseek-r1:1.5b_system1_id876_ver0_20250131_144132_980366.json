    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That's concerning because being in jail for two separate crimes is significant. I should note that.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 115 lbs. That seems about right for an 18-year-old, so no issue there. Her height and weight are within the normal range, so not a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone now. That might be concerning because being single can lead to issues with family support or financial responsibilities. However, it's not something that would typically indicate high risk on its own unless combined with other factors.\n\nHer educational background: She has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. That could mean she's looking for another path or hasn't pursued education beyond what's available. It might affect her ability to handle the next steps in law school or work, so that's something to watch out for.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years\u2014she used marijuana and cocaine. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues, addiction problems, and legal consequences. Given she's an 18-year-old, this could be a significant risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health is important, feeling depressed might not directly indicate high risk unless it affects her ability to function in society or leads to criminal behavior. But since she hasn't used drugs and has been arrested twice, that's more immediate concern.\n\nAt age 18, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size four. That seems normal for an 18-year-old, but it might indicate that she's not fully independent yet or is dealing with some social challenges. It could affect her ability to handle the next steps in law school or work.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal life. This is interesting because it suggests a spiritual aspect to her behavior. While that's not inherently a risk factor, it might indicate that she's seeking guidance from a higher power, which could be positive or challenging depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together, the main high-risk factors seem to be being arrested twice without conviction, drug use in the past four years, and feeling depressed over the past month. These are serious issues that could lead to criminal behavior if not addressed properly. The other factors like age living with parents, educational background, and spiritual beliefs might contribute positively but aren't sufficient on their own to indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
