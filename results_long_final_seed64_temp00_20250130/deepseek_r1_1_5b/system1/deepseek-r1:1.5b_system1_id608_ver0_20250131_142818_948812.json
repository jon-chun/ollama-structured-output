    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That seems okay in terms of gender and racial representation, but it might be concerning if there are any underlying issues related to race or identity that could affect her behavior or decision-making.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant number of convictions, which can indicate potential criminal behavior. However, the risk isn't just about being caught; it's also about how she handles the consequences of being caught. If she's not taking responsibility for her actions, that could be a red flag.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. That's within the healthy weight range for her age, so physical health isn't an issue here. However, if there were underlying health problems or chronic conditions, that might raise concerns about mental health or other factors affecting risk assessment.\n\nHer height is not a major concern in terms of health, but it's something to note. She weighs 120 lbs, which is within the healthy weight range for her age, so this isn't an issue.\n\nShe's never been married and is currently living alone. This could be concerning if she has issues with relationships or family dynamics that might affect her decision-making or behavior in a risky way. Living alone can sometimes lead to stress or isolation, which might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This is a significant gap in education, which could indicate potential issues with academic performance, time management, or other skills that are important for criminal behavior. A lack of education can sometimes lead to criminal activities if someone lacks the necessary knowledge or skills.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year and hasn't mentioned any specific job details. This is a bit vague, but it suggests she's been through multiple roles, which could indicate changes in her life circumstances or experiences that might affect her behavior. However, without more specifics, it's hard to assess the risk level.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious mental health issues, including depression or anxiety. If she hasn't felt depressed, that could be a red flag for criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3. This might indicate family dynamics that could affect her decision-making or behavior. Living with her biological mother could lead to issues related to family relationships, which might contribute to criminal behavior if there are unresolved conflicts or issues affecting her mental health.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is a strong statement about her belief in divine influence on her life and behavior. However, it's important to consider how this belief interacts with other risk factors. If she believes in God but hasn't shown signs of criminal behavior or mental health issues related to that belief, it might not be a high-risk indicator.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the person has significant convictions, which is concerning. She's living alone and may face stress from that, which could contribute to criminal behavior. The lack of education and job history suggests potential academic or life circumstances that might affect her decision-making. Drug use without feelings of depression is a red flag for criminal behavior. Living with her biological mother in a small household could lead to unresolved family issues affecting her mental health. Believing in God doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless it's combined with other indicators like drug use and mental health issues.\n\nOverall, the combination of significant convictions, living alone, lack of education, job history, drug use without depression, and family dynamics seems concerning for a high-risk individual.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
