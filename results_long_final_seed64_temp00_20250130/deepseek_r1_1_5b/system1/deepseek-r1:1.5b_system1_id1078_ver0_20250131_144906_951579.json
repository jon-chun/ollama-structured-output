    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might indicate some underlying issues or potential biases that could affect his behavior. But I'm not sure how significant this is yet.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's quite a number of convictions. However, if he's a minor, maybe the consequences are different. But since he's 20, it might be more serious. Still, that's a lot of convictions for his age.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 180 lbs. That's a decent build but not extremely tall or short. His weight is also average, which could affect how he interacts with others.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Singlehood can lead to issues like domestic abuse if he has children, though he doesn't mention that yet. Also, living alone might make him more vulnerable to mental health issues, especially since he hasn't felt depressed in the past month.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's a clear sign of potential educational gaps. Many people with arrest records don't go to college, which could lead to criminal behavior if they lack the education needed for higher-level crimes.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year, but he did use marijuana in the past four years. Using drugs is concerning because it can lead to addiction and mental health issues. Even though he's a minor, using substances like marijuana might be problematic, especially if he hasn't felt depressed yet.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3. That could mean he has some family support but might also face challenges from other sources. Living alone is still risky because it can lead to issues like domestic abuse or neglect, which are serious and can affect mental health.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This seems concerning because it suggests a lack of personal accountability or control over his actions. If he's living under the impression that God isn't involved, he might feel isolated or vulnerable, especially if he's facing criminal charges.\n\nPutting all these together: He's a minor with significant convictions, no high school diploma, singlehood, and has used marijuana. All these factors point towards potential risks of substance abuse, mental health issues, domestic violence, and vulnerability to criminal behavior. The lack of personal accountability from God adds another layer of concern. So, it seems like he does have high risk factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
