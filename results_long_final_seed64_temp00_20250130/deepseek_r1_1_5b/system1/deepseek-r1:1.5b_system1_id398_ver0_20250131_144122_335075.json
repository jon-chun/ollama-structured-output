    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to note. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's concerning because being in jail for the first time can lead to serious legal issues and potential criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 165 lbs. While that doesn't seem extremely tall or overweight, it could be a sign of underlying health issues or stress-related problems, which might affect his ability to handle the consequences of being in jail.\n\nHis age is 20, which is relatively young for someone who's been arrested once. That seems concerning because it might indicate he hasn't fully grown up yet, which can lead to legal issues and potential criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That could be a sign of stress or financial instability, but I'm not sure if that's a high risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. That might indicate he hasn't fully developed his skills or interests yet, which could lead to criminal behavior later on.\n\nHe's 4 jobs during the year, which is interesting because it shows he's been working consistently but not necessarily in a stable job. However, that doesn't immediately raise red flags for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That could be concerning because using drugs can lead to serious mental health issues, which might affect his ability to handle the consequences of being in jail.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5. That's unusual for someone who's been arrested once. It might indicate that he hasn't fully grown up yet or has some underlying issues related to his upbringing.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting because it suggests there's an underlying belief system or spiritual aspect to his behavior, which could be a red flag for criminal activity.\n\nPutting all these factors together, I think he might have underlying health issues, stress-related problems, or a lack of development that could lead to criminal behavior. However, the specifics are still unclear, so it's hard to say definitively if this indicates high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
