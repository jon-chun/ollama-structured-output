    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high-risk indicator because most criminal justice assessments focus on specific behaviors or circumstances that could lead to serious crimes. Mixed-race individuals are more common in crime due to genetic factors, but I'm not sure if this is a significant risk factor.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This seems concerning because being arrested without conviction can indicate potential criminal behavior. However, it's also possible that the arrest was a minor offense or that she had some underlying issues that made her vulnerable to reoffending. I'm leaning towards yes here because an arrest without conviction is a red flag.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 124 lbs. That doesn't seem like a high risk factor on its own. Body weight can vary widely, and unless there are specific health issues or conditions that could lead to criminal behavior, this alone isn't a concern.\n\nHer height is within the normal range for her age, so I don't think this is a significant risk factor. It's possible she has some physical vulnerabilities, but without more information, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior if there are underlying problems like substance abuse or mental health issues. However, the individual hasn't used drugs in the past four years or used drugs during the past month. That's a key point\u2014she hasn't engaged in drug use at all. This is a clear red flag because drug use is a serious crime and can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which means she lacks basic education. Many individuals with lower education levels are more likely to engage in criminal activities due to lack of knowledge and skills. This could be a significant risk factor because it puts them at higher risk for committing crimes without proper qualifications.\n\nShe's not enrolled in college either, so her education level is even lower than the previous point. This further increases the likelihood that she might engage in criminal behavior or commit crimes without proper training or resources.\n\nShe has held no jobs during the year and hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. The fact that she hasn't engaged in drug use at all means she's not at risk of using illegal substances, which is a major component of criminal behavior. This is a clear indicator of potential high-risk behavior.\n\nAdditionally, she considers God has nothing to do with her personal issues. While this could be interpreted as seeking redemption or finding peace, it doesn't directly address the underlying risks related to drug use and criminal behavior. However, the lack of drug use is still a significant risk factor because it's a serious issue that can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the absence of drug use over four years, lack of education, and potential criminal behavior due to lack of qualifications are strong indicators of high risk. The arrest without conviction also adds another layer of concern because it could indicate reoffending or underlying issues that make someone more vulnerable to criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
