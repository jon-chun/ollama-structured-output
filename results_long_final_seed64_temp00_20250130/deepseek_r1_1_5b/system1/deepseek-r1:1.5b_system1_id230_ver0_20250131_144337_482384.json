    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because criminal activity can be serious. His height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight of 168 lbs are within normal ranges for his age.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might indicate some stress or strain on his family life. His high school diploma and enrollment in a 4-year college suggest he has some education but hasn't completed it yet. He's currently enrolled, so that could mean he's working towards a degree or taking some courses to get there.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, which might indicate part-time work or something similar. He's used drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting because drug use can be serious, but he hasn't been feeling too bad about it.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life, which is a bit unusual. It might indicate some spiritual or religious influence in his behavior, but I'm not sure how significant that is for risk assessment purposes.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: criminal history (two arrests), substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine), lack of depression, living alone, high school diploma, part-time job, and a belief in God. These all seem like potential risks or complications.\n\nI think he's at least in a vulnerable position because he's young, single, has a family to support, and hasn't been feeling too depressed. His criminal history is significant but not extreme. The substance use is serious enough that it could lead to addiction or mental health issues. However, he's not showing signs of immediate distress from the drugs.\n\nHis high school diploma suggests some education, which might be an asset in the long run, but if he hasn't completed it yet, that's a bit concerning. His part-time job and lack of substance abuse could mean he has some financial stability or work experience to rely on.\n\nOverall, while there are several factors that could indicate risk, especially his substance use and living alone, I'm not sure if they're enough to classify him as high risk. It might depend on how severe the substance use is and whether he's showing signs of distress from it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
