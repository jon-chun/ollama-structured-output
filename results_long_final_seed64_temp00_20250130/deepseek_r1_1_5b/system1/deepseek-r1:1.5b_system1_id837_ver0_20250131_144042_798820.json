    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a positive sign because it shows he has some level of self-identity, which can be beneficial in court. He's been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear indicator of potential criminal behavior. His age being under 21 adds to the risk assessment since many courts have strict age limits for certain charges.\n\nHe is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 pounds. While height and weight are generally considered normal, they don't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless there's a specific context or history that points towards it. However, since he has never been married and is living alone, that might raise some red flags about his social life and potential relationships.\n\nHis family background: He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area. That could be concerning because rural areas can have different cultural and social dynamics compared to urban settings. Living alone for an extended period is risky, especially if he's not married yet. It might lead to issues like domestic violence or strained relationships.\n\nHe has never had a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could be a red flag because many criminal records are linked to individuals who have completed education up to the age of 21, especially if they've been serving time. His lack of formal education might indicate some underlying issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held one job during the year and used marijuana in the past four years, with most of his drug use concentrated in the last month. Using marijuana is a serious violation of laws, but it's not clear if this was intentional or just a random act. However, using substances like marijuana can lead to serious consequences, including criminal charges.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. This could indicate issues with his relationships, possibly leading to problems in the household that might escalate into criminal behavior. Living alone without being married is risky because it can affect family dynamics and potentially lead to domestic violence if he's not involved in a relationship.\n\nHis self-identified identity as White doesn't inherently raise immediate risk factors, but it could be part of a broader pattern of identity issues that might contribute to criminal behavior over time.\n\nPutting this all together, the person has a history of criminal convictions, which is a strong indicator. However, his family background living in a rural area, living alone, and using marijuana are significant red flags that could indicate criminal activity. The lack of education and potential relationship issues also add to the risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
