    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because Hispanic individuals are often associated with higher rates of crime in some areas. But I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it shows he's tried, but the outcome isn't favorable. It might indicate a pattern of behavior or substance abuse that leads to recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight are 5 feet 10 inches and 202 lbs. While physical size can be a factor in crime, I don't think it's the main risk here unless there's an underlying issue like substance use or poverty.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet and is living alone. That's risky because being single increases the likelihood of criminal behavior due to lack of support networks. But since he's 21, maybe that's a bit more concerning than someone in their early twenties.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma plus enrollment in a 4-year college. That suggests some academic ability but not necessarily criminal knowledge or skills. It might indicate potential for higher education, which could lead to criminal careers if he chooses the wrong path.\n\nHe has held four jobs during the year and used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Using drugs is a serious issue that can lead to criminal behavior. Even though it's not illegal, it can have long-term consequences like addiction and mental health issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can affect criminal behavior, this seems more of a general mental health concern rather than a specific risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHis family background: lived with his adoptive parent in a household of size 5 in an urban area. That's a significant living situation that could lead to criminal behavior due to lack of support and resources. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but it's not the only factor here.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests he has a spiritual or religious background, which could influence his behavior. However, without more context on how that ties into criminal behavior, it's hard to assess risk.\n\nPutting this all together: He's at risk due to past drug use and substance abuse, which can lead to criminal behavior. His family living in an urban area with a significant household size might contribute to higher crime rates. His lack of support networks is another factor. While his Hispanic background could be a red flag, it's not the primary concern here.\n\nSo, I think this person does have high risk factors related to substance abuse and family living conditions.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
