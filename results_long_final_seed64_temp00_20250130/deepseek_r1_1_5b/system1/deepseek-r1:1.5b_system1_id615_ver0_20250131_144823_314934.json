    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because criminal activity can be serious. His height of 6 feet 0 inches and weight of 165 lbs are within normal ranges for his age.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might indicate some stress or strain on his family life. His education level is a GED, but he hasn't enrolled in college yet, so that could be an indicator of potential academic challenges. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might mean he's working or studying part-time.\n\nHe's used to using drugs\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting because drug use can sometimes lead to mental health issues, even if it doesn't necessarily cause depression. However, it's something that needs monitoring for potential long-term effects.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents in a household of size four in an urban area. That might be a significant stressor, especially if he's dealing with his drug use and other issues. Living alone could exacerbate feelings of loneliness or isolation, which is a red flag for high risk behavior.\n\nHis background includes holding one job during the year, which suggests some level of employment stability but doesn't directly indicate criminal activity. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years except for the ones mentioned, so that's consistent with his drug history.\n\nHe considers God to have nothing to do with his personal life, which is unusual and could be a red flag indicating a lack of faith or personal freedom. This might lead him to engage in risky behaviors due to his beliefs about God's role in his life.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has multiple concerning factors: past criminal convictions, drug use, living alone, significant stress from family issues, and a belief in God's influence on their behavior. These elements make me lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
