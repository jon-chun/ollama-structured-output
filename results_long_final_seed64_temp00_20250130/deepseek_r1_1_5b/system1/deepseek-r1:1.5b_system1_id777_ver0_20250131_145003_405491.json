    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means she's facing legal consequences, which could be concerning if the arrest was based on something serious.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That seems about right for a young adult, so not an issue there. She's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to stress or issues with relationships, but it doesn't automatically mean she's at high risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. That suggests she might have some academic potential, which could be an asset if she goes through the legal process. However, it also means she might need to complete education, which could add time or stress.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. This shows she's employed, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a criminal history unless those jobs were related to her past behavior. I should keep that in mind as potential opportunities for advancement rather than risks.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious mental health issues, including depression. It's a red flag that could indicate underlying stress or trauma from her past behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. That places her in a potentially stressful environment, especially if the community is unstable or has issues related to her family dynamics. Living alone adds another layer of stress and potential for abuse or neglect.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This seems like a strong indicator of spiritual or divine influence affecting her life. It could lead to internal conflicts, stress, or emotional instability, which might be a sign of high risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors point towards potential issues related to drug use, mental health, family dynamics, and personal beliefs about God's role in her life. These could contribute to criminal behavior if not addressed properly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
