    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race and identity issues. I should consider how that affects his behavior or decisions.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This is concerning because it shows he's facing legal consequences, which could lead to serious legal issues later on. The fact that he's not convicted adds another layer of risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight between 175 and 199 pounds. While physical attributes can be a factor in certain situations, I'm not sure if this directly indicates high risk unless there are specific health concerns or other issues related to his size.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. This could mean he has limited social interactions, which might affect his relationships or opportunities for advancement. However, living alone is more about personal circumstances than a direct risk factor in terms of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This shows he hasn't pursued higher education, which might limit his career options and opportunities for criminal justice training. It's something to note because it could impact his future prospects.\n\nHe's not currently using any drugs and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors that don't directly indicate high risk but are important for overall well-being and mental health, which can influence criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. This could mean he has some family dynamics or experiences that might affect his decision-making or behavior as an adult. It's something to consider because it might indicate a potential for issues related to family life.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life, which is interesting but not necessarily a risk factor unless there are specific beliefs or practices that could lead to criminal behavior. However, without more context on how his religious views influence his actions, this isn't directly assessable as a high-risk indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns seem to be his arrest history, lack of conviction, physical attributes, and living alone. These factors might indicate potential for criminal behavior or legal issues in the future. However, without specific evidence linking these factors to past crimes or current actions, they don't definitively show high risk.\n\nI should also consider if any of these factors could be indicators of substance abuse or mental health issues that might lead to criminal behavior. But since he hasn't used drugs and hasn't felt depressed in the past month, this isn't a clear indicator either.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some risk factors like arrest history, lack of conviction, living alone, and family dynamics, they don't strongly indicate high risk without more specific information or context.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
