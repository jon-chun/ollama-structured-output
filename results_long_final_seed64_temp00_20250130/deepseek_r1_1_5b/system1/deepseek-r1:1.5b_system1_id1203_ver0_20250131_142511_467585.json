    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race, but I'm not sure how significant that is yet. He has been arrested four times and convicted, which is quite a high number for someone his age. Four arrests in five years seems like a lot, especially if he's already 21.\n\nNext, he's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. That's a bit on the lighter side for his height, but it doesn't immediately indicate anything concerning me. His weight is about average for his age, so that might not be a major risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That could mean he's dealing with some stress from being single, which might affect his mental health. However, I'm not sure how this ties into the overall risk assessment yet.\n\nHis education level isn't high: no diploma or GED, and he's not enrolled in college. This could be a red flag because it shows he hasn't achieved a basic level of education, which might lead to some challenges in learning or dealing with responsibilities. But again, I'm not sure how this translates into risk.\n\nHe has held one job during the year but hasn't mentioned it yet. That's a bit vague and could mean he's either not working or hasn't provided information about his current role. It doesn't directly indicate high risk factors unless there are specific issues with his employment, which I don't have any info on.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has had some emotional struggles, especially during the past month where he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This is a significant issue because using substances like marijuana can lead to addiction or mental health problems. The fact that he's been using it for four years adds another layer of concern.\n\nHis background includes living with his biological mother in an urban household of size five and considering God to have something to do with his personal life. These details might suggest a family dynamic, but I'm not sure how this affects his overall risk level unless there are specific issues related to his family or environment.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the number of arrests, his weight, lack of education, and his substance use history. The four arrests in five years is concerning because that's a high rate for someone his age. His weight being on the lower side might not be a major issue, but his living situation could indicate stress or mental health challenges. His lack of education and job history might lead to some complications unless he's able to work. His substance use history is particularly concerning as it can cause addiction and emotional issues.\n\nI think these factors together suggest high risk because the number of arrests, weight, lack of education, and substance use all point towards potential mental health challenges or personal issues that could affect his ability to function in society.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
