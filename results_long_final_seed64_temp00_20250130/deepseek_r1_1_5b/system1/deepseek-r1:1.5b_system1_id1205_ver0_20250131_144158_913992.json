    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race and identity. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because if someone gets caught, they can face serious consequences. However, since she's 19, maybe the impact isn't as severe as for older individuals. Still, it's something to watch out for.\n\nHer height and weight are normal: 5 feet 6 inches and 160 lbs. That doesn't seem concerning on its own. But combined with her background of living alone in an urban area without a job or drugs, that might raise some red flags about independence and mental health.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That could mean she's working part-time or not pursuing further education. It might affect her ability to handle the consequences of being convicted, especially if they're severe.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Those are positive signs because substance abuse can lead to serious legal issues, and mental health problems like depression can also have long-term effects on someone's ability to handle justice.\n\nHer background living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area is interesting. It might indicate some social isolation or stress from family responsibilities. Living alone could be a significant challenge, especially if she's not married and has no children.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal life. That seems like a red flag because it suggests she's not taking responsibility for her actions or decisions. If someone identifies with their faith in such a way, they might face more serious consequences, including legal issues related to their beliefs.\n\nPutting all these together: She's young, has some background stress from living alone and possibly family responsibilities, but hasn't engaged in substance abuse or mental health issues. However, her racial identity and the potential for long-term effects on her mental health make me lean towards high risk. The lack of substance abuse and depression is positive, but the other factors could compound her situation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
