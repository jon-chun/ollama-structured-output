That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He's been arrested six times and convicted, which is quite a lot. Each arrest carries significant consequences, so that's definitely a red flag.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. That's within the average range for his age, so not an issue. His height isn't particularly concerning either. He's never been married and is living alone, which might be a bit lonely, but that could also depend on context.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and hasn't enrolled in college. While education can sometimes lead to better opportunities, it doesn't necessarily mean he's at risk. His lack of enrollment might indicate some level of dependency or financial strain, though that's not something I've seen before.\n\nHe's 5 years old when he lived with adults other than biological parents in a rural household of size two. That seems unusual and could be concerning because it's a very young age living with non-parents. It might raise questions about his independence and how he handles responsibilities, which could affect his ability to make decisions on his own.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to serious health issues or addiction problems, so that's a red flag. He's also not feeling depressed, which might indicate he's managing it well, but substance use is still concerning.\n\nHe's living alone at 5 years old, which is quite young and could be a sign of dependency. It might affect his ability to make decisions on his own or handle responsibilities effectively. Additionally, he considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which is unusual. It raises questions about how he handles his emotions and relationships.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests, substance use history, living alone at a young age, and the lack of feeling depressed over a month are all significant risk factors. These combine to make him a high-risk individual.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
