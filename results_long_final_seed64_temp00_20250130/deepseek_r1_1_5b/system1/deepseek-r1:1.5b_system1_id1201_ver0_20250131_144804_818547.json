    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race and identity issues. But I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it means she could face legal consequences, which can be risky in itself. However, if the arrest was due to a serious crime like murder or rape, maybe it's less severe. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, that adds some risk.\n\nShe is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 162 lbs. That seems about right for her age, but I'm not sure how that affects her risk level. Maybe height isn't a big factor here.\n\nHer family status: never married, living alone now, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. High school diploma is often a prerequisite for some jobs and higher education, so this could be a red flag. But she's 19, which might mean she hasn't had much time to build up her skills yet.\n\nShe has held three jobs during the year. That suggests she's employed at least part-time or full-time, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a criminal history. However, having multiple jobs could be a sign of stability and reliability, which is good for law enforcement.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues like addiction, mental health problems, and even legal consequences if caught. It's a significant risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems more positive than negative. Feeling depressed could be a red flag for mental health issues that might affect her ability to handle criminal behavior or face legal consequences.\n\nHer household size: 3 people in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but it's not the only factor. Her living situation being single or with biological parents is also concerning because it could indicate a lack of support system for law enforcement and potential mental health issues.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her personal life. This seems like a red flag. If someone identifies with their faith in such a way that they don't see the impact of their actions on others, it might raise concerns about their ability to handle criminal behavior or face legal consequences.\n\nPutting this all together, several factors are pointing towards potential high risk:\n- Multiple arrests without conviction.\n- Drug use history (marijuana and cocaine).\n- Lack of support system for law enforcement.\n- Feeling depressed over the past month.\n- Consideration that God doesn't influence her actions.\n\nThese elements could make her a high-risk individual. However, it's important to note that each person is different, and some factors might be mitigated by others. Without more context, it's challenging to assess the severity of these risks accurately.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
