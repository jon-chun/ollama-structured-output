    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors presented and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not immediately alarming, but it's something to note. He has been arrested once and convicted, which could be concerning. The arrest rate for this age group might be higher than average, so that's a red flag.\n\nNext, he's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 160 lbs. That seems about normal for his age, but it's worth noting. His height is on the lower side, which could indicate potential issues with mobility or balance in older adults.\n\nHe's separated and living alone. Separation can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. Living alone might be a risk factor because it increases the likelihood of substance abuse, especially if he has a history of using drugs. That's a significant point to consider.\n\nHis weight is 160 lbs. For his age, that's below average, but again, not necessarily alarming. However, combined with other factors like being separated and living alone, this could add up.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This might indicate he hasn't attended school recently or is still working, which could affect his ability to handle substance use or make decisions about his future. It's something to watch for.\n\nHe's not currently employed, which means he's looking for work. If he's struggling financially and has a history of substance abuse, that could be a risk factor. Financial instability combined with substance abuse is a concern.\n\nHe's separated and living alone, as mentioned earlier, increases the risk of substance use, especially if he hasn't been able to access resources or support recently. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHis past four years include using marijuana, which is a significant risk factor for addiction. The fact that he has used it in the past four years and some time during the past month indicates a history of substance abuse, which is concerning.\n\nHe's considered that God has something to do with his personal issues. While this could be interpreted as seeking help or support, it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk unless combined with other factors like substance use and living alone.\n\nHis upbringing in an urban household of size 4 might have contributed to potential stress and anxiety, which can lead to substance abuse. This is another point to consider but not conclusive on its own.\n\nPutting all these together, the person has a history of substance abuse (marijuana), is separated and living alone, has a high school diploma without college completion, and has been arrested once. These factors significantly increase the risk of addiction and potential harm from substance use.\n\nTherefore, I would predict that this individual is at a high risk for addiction and related issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
