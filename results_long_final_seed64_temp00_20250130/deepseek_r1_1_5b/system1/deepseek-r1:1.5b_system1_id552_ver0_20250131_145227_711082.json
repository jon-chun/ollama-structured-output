    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because race can sometimes be a sign of potential issues, but it's not always indicative of criminal behavior. I should consider how that might affect him in the long run.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Three arrests are significant, especially if they're related to serious crimes like burglary or theft. Convictions could indicate past delinquency or other issues that might lead to criminal behavior now.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight of 210 lbs. That's within the average range for his age, so it doesn't seem out of the ordinary. However, if someone is too tall or too short relative to their age, it can sometimes be a red flag, but again, not always a clear indicator.\n\nHis marital status is never married and currently living alone. This could indicate issues with relationships, which might lead to criminal behavior later on. But without more context, it's hard to say if that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's a clear sign of potential academic issues. Many people who are at this stage face challenges like substance abuse, financial difficulties, or other issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held one job during the year but hasn't mentioned it. If he's employed, his job stability might affect his ability to commit crimes. However, if he's not employed, that could be a red flag for potential issues in the future.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances is a serious issue, but it doesn't necessarily mean criminal behavior. However, substance abuse can lead to other problems like substance addiction or mental health issues, which might contribute to criminal behavior later.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size six. That's quite large for someone who's 20 years old. It could indicate issues with family dynamics, relationships, or possibly substance use if the person is more dependent on others.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests a spiritual aspect to his behavior. However, without more context about how this affects criminal behavior, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nPutting all these factors together: three arrests, being arrested again, height and weight within average range, never married or living alone (which could indicate issues), lack of education, job history, substance use, family size, and spiritual aspect. These all point towards potential criminal behavior rather than just a young adult struggling with life.\n\nI think the risk assessment should lean towards high because there are multiple signs pointing to possible criminal behavior, including substance abuse, possibly delinquency, issues with relationships or family dynamics, and lack of education which can lead to criminal activities.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
