    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some red flags about race and identity issues. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it means she could face legal consequences even if she doesn't commit a crime. However, the lack of conviction might be mitigated by other factors like her background or circumstances.\n\nHer height and weight are within normal ranges for her age, so that doesn't seem high risk. She hasn't been married yet, which is fine, but living alone could affect her mental health if she's dealing with stress from being single.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which might indicate some academic challenges or lack of motivation. But without specific issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, it's harder to assess risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but she did use substances during the past month. That seems concerning because it could lead to serious legal issues if she was caught. However, I don't know how often she uses substances or if there are any underlying factors that might make her more vulnerable.\n\nHer life situation is simple\u2014single and living alone. This can be a significant risk factor because single individuals may face higher rates of substance abuse, mental health issues, and legal problems. Living alone also means they're not in a household with others, which could affect their independence and ability to seek help.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year but hasn't used them all yet. This might indicate that she's been working long hours or dealing with stress from multiple jobs, which could be risky if she's not managing her time effectively.\n\nHer lack of substance use in the past four years is a plus, but the recent spike in substance use indicates potential for legal consequences. However, without knowing about specific incidents or how often she uses substances, it's hard to gauge risk.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life, which might raise questions about her beliefs and how they interact with her behavior. This could be a red flag if it affects her mental health or ability to handle stress.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the lack of conviction despite arrest, living alone, being single, and recent substance use seem like significant risks. The high school diploma and lack of academic motivation don't add much risk on their own. However, the combination makes this individual a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
