    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a positive sign because it shows he's at least of average intelligence and has some social skills. He's been arrested once and convicted, which is concerning but not impossible. His age being 18 might mean he's in a vulnerable age group, so that could be a red flag.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 160 lbs. That's within the average range for his height, so no immediate risk there. He never married and is living alone, which is interesting because it shows he's single, but I'm not sure how that affects his behavior or mental health.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma with plans to go to a 4-year college. That suggests he has some potential for success in the future, but it doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless there are other signs of past crimes.\n\nHe's 18 years old and hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. That's a clear sign of substance abuse because young people often start using drugs before they reach the legal age. His lack of drug use is concerning.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is good. However, feeling depressed can sometimes lead to substance abuse or other behaviors that might contribute to criminal behavior, so it's not a definitive indicator.\n\nAt 18, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size four. That's a small family, but it doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless there are specific patterns of behavior or interactions that could lead to issues.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests he might have some spiritual or religious influence on his decisions and actions. However, without more context about how this influences his behavior, it's hard to assess the risk level.\n\nPutting all these factors together: He's at a vulnerable age, has a history of criminal convictions, has substance abuse issues, and shows signs of spiritual involvement. These elements could indicate higher risk because they present multiple potential areas where he might engage in criminal activities or show signs of delinquency.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
