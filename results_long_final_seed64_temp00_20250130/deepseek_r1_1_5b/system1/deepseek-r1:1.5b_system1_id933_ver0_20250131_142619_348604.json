    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male and identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me with any high-risk indicators, especially since he's just starting his life. But I should consider if his background might affect him in some way.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because it means he's facing legal consequences. However, the arrest itself isn't necessarily a risk factor unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 185 lbs. While that's not an issue on its own, I should think about how physical size might affect his behavior or decision-making. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. That's interesting because being single can sometimes lead to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, but it doesn't inherently make someone a high-risk individual unless there are other factors at play.\n\nHis education level: He has never been married (which I think refers to his marital status) and does not have a high school diploma or GED. That's a significant lack of education because many arrestees end up in prison due to lack of education, but again, without more context on substance use or mental health issues, it's hard to assess risk.\n\nHe has held 1 job during the year. That could indicate some level of responsibility or stress, which might lead to substance abuse or other behaviors, but it doesn't directly translate into a high-risk individual unless there are underlying issues.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors that don't inherently increase risk. However, they could be indicators of substance use if he's been using for longer periods without being detected.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5. That's a stable environment, which is good because it reduces stress and allows the individual to focus on their development. But again, unless there are other issues like substance use or mental health problems, this doesn't directly indicate high risk.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This seems more philosophical and less actionable. It might influence his behavior but isn't a concrete risk factor unless it's linked to underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health.\n\nPutting all these together, while he's an 18-year-old, hasn't been convicted, has some education issues, and is living alone, the lack of specific evidence on substance use or mental health problems makes me lean towards NO for high risk. However, I should consider that without more context, it's a bit uncertain.\n\nI think the best approach is to say NO because there's no concrete evidence linking these factors to higher risk levels. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each point again.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
