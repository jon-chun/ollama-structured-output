    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided JSON structure. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not particularly concerning on its own, but it's something to note. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit of a red flag because being in jail for something he didn't commit can be risky.\n\nNext, his height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight is 165 lbs. Those are pretty average measurements, so not necessarily high risk factors here. He's never married and isn't living alone, which might indicate some level of independence or potential stress from being in a single household. However, that seems more about lifestyle than criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. That could mean he's working or hasn't decided to go back to school yet. It doesn't directly relate to criminal activity, so maybe this isn't the highest risk factor.\n\nHe's not currently living alone and has never been married. This suggests he might be dealing with some stress from being single, which can sometimes lead to criminal behavior. But again, it's more about mental health than criminal intent.\n\nHis job history is just one year of employment, so that doesn't add much to his risk factors. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years or felt depressed over the past month, which are both positive indicators. However, feeling depressed can sometimes lead to substance use or other behaviors, but this seems more about mental health than criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. That's not particularly concerning on its own, but it might indicate some stress from being in a larger family, which could be a sign of stress that might lead to criminal behavior later on.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests he may have a spiritual or religious background, which could influence his decisions and behaviors. However, unless there's evidence of supernatural influences or specific religious practices leading to criminal activities, this isn't necessarily a high risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together, the main risk factors seem to be being arrested once without conviction, living in a single household, feeling depressed over the past month, and possibly having a spiritual background. These could indicate underlying stress or mental health issues that might lead to criminal behavior later on. However, without more specific information about his criminal history or other indicators of substance abuse or delinquency, it's hard to assign an exact confidence level.\n\nSo, my prediction is that this person has some high risk factors, but the confidence isn't very high because while there are signs of stress and mental health issues, they don't directly point to criminal behavior. Therefore, I would say \"YES\" with a confidence of 30%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
