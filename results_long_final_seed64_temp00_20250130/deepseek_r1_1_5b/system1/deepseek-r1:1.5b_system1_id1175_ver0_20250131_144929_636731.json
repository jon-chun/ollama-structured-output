    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old, male, identifies as Black. That's a positive sign because race can sometimes be an indicator of potential issues, but it's not always a red flag. He has been arrested 11 times and convicted, which is quite high. Convictions are serious, so that definitely adds to the risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 pounds. That seems normal for an adult, but height can vary based on genetics and environment. However, combined with his past convictions, this might raise concerns about his behavior or mental state.\n\nHis weight is within a healthy range, so that's not concerning. He hasn't been married yet, which could mean he's single or has had previous relationships. Being not living alone suggests he may have issues with social support, which could be risky if he's involved in criminal activities.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. That means he might have some work experience or skills that could be useful, but it doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior. His lack of education doesn't automatically make someone a danger risk; it just depends on other factors like past convictions and mental health.\n\nHe's not employed and has held 1 job during the year. This suggests he may have some work experience, which could be an asset if he's involved in criminal activities. However, without more information about his skills or previous behavior, this alone doesn't add much to the risk assessment.\n\nHe's a Black person, which is a positive sign but not a red flag. He's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs, which are typical adult weights. His gender isn't mentioned, so it could be male or female. He's never married, which might indicate he's single or has had previous relationships. Being not living alone suggests issues with social support, which is a red flag because criminal activities often involve social interactions.\n\nHe's a 18-year-old, which means he hasn't had much time to develop his skills or experience. This could be an asset if he's involved in criminal activities but also a risk if he's not developing those abilities properly. His past drug use (marijuana) and current feelings of depression are serious concerns. Using drugs is a clear indicator of mental health issues, which can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and is currently feeling down, which is concerning. This combination suggests he may be struggling with substance abuse or mental health issues. His family background living with his biological mother in an urban area could indicate stress or other factors that might contribute to criminal behavior if not managed properly.\n\nHis religious belief isn't mentioned, but it's a personal choice and doesn't directly relate to the risk assessment unless there are specific beliefs about criminal behavior, which is generally not considered a factor. His age being 18 means he hasn't had much time to develop his skills or experience, which could be an asset if he's involved in criminal activities but also a risk if he's not developing those abilities properly.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of convictions, substance abuse history, and current mental health issues are significant factors that indicate high risk. The other factors like height, weight, education level, marital status, employment, and family background don't add enough to the overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
