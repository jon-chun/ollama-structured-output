    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because that could indicate criminal behavior or past actions that might be linked to current issues.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That seems about right for an adult male, so not a high risk factor in terms of height or weight. He never married yet, but he's currently living alone. This could mean he's dealing with some form of loneliness or stress from being single, which might affect his mental health.\n\nHe's enrolled in school at the present moment. That suggests he's actively trying to learn and develop skills, which is positive. However, if he's not attending school properly, that could be a red flag for potential issues down the line.\n\nHe has never been married but now lives alone. This might indicate feelings of loneliness or stress from being single, which could affect his mental health. He hasn't had any significant problems with relationships in the past four years, so maybe he's not facing immediate issues related to that aspect.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious health problems, including addiction, which could be a risk factor for future issues like mental health problems or criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not ideal, it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk of depression in the long term. However, if he's consistently struggling with feelings of sadness or anxiety, that might raise concerns about his mental well-being.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. That means he has some family support, but it's not extensive. Living alone could be a significant stressor for someone who's just starting to navigate life on their own. This might affect his ability to focus or develop skills.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting because it suggests he's seeking some form of divine guidance or purpose in his life. However, if this doesn't align with his current actions or behavior, it could indicate a lack of faith or spiritual involvement, which might be a red flag for future issues.\n\nPutting all these factors together: He has past criminal convictions, which is concerning. He's living alone and may face stress from that, but he hasn't shown signs of depression. He's enrolled in school, which is positive, but if he's not attending properly, it could indicate underlying issues. The lack of family support at a young age might be a concern for mental health. His use of drugs adds another layer of risk.\n\nSo overall, I think this person has some high-risk factors that could lead to serious consequences in the future.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
