    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this person based on the provided information and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old and a male, which is within legal age limits. That seems okay. He identifies as Hispanic, which is common in many communities, so that doesn't raise his alarm much.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted, but I don't have the specific details of each crime. However, being convicted could indicate some level of criminal behavior, but it's not clear if that's a high-risk indicator without more context.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight 145 lbs. These are average values for his age, so no immediate red flags here.\n\nHe's 5 years old now? Wait, the user wrote \"he is currently living alone.\" That seems like he's in his late teens or early twenties. Maybe I misread that earlier. Let me check again: \"he is currently living alone.\" So if he's an 18-year-old, this might be a mistake. Or perhaps it means he's single and not married, which aligns with the other factors.\n\nHe's enrolled in school at the present moment. That suggests he has some academic or educational aspirations, but without knowing his specific plans, it's hard to assess risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, but he used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and had some emotional downtime. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues, addiction problems, and mental health challenges. The emotional downtime also seems like a red flag for substance abuse.\n\nHe's from a household of size 4 with his biological mother, which is common in many areas. He considers God has nothing to do with his personal life, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's more or less likely to engage in risky behaviors based on religious beliefs alone.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use and emotional distress are significant risk factors. The lack of substance abuse history makes me cautious, but the current behavior points towards higher risk. I'm leaning towards high risk because of the drug use and the emotional state described.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
