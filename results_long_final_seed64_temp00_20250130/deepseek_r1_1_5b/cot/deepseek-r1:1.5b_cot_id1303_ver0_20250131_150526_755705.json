    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice. He's living alone, never married, doesn't have a high school diploma, has used drugs (marjuana) in the past four years, and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. He also mentions that he considered God to be involved with his personal life when he was young.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors here. The main ones seem to be substance use, living alone, lack of education, and possibly family dynamics. Since he's an 18-year-old Black male who has been arrested twice, that might indicate some underlying issues or past behavior that could affect recidivism.\n\nHe's never married, which is a bit concerning because being single can sometimes lead to higher rates of rearrest due to isolation. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so he might not be fully prepared for the demands of college or employment. Using drugs in the past four years could add another layer of risk, especially if it's related to his behavior now.\n\nHe's living alone, which is significant because being single can increase recidivism rates due to isolation and lack of support systems. His family dynamics might play a role too; if he was raised by a parent who had issues or if there are strained relationships, that could affect his recidivism risk.\n\nI should also consider his age and gender. As a Black male in his early 18s, he's probably facing some form of discrimination or social isolation, which might contribute to higher rearrest rates. His lack of education means he might not have the skills needed for the job market, but since he's been arrested twice, maybe that indicates some underlying issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign because depression can be a significant factor in recidivism. However, it's still something to consider as a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting this all together, I think his lack of education and living alone are strong risk factors. He's also been arrested twice, which might indicate some underlying issues that could lead to higher recidivism rates. His substance use is another concern because drug use can be a significant risk factor in itself.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014his age, gender, lack of education, living alone, substance use, and family dynamics\u2014it seems like there's a high risk he might rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lack_of_education\", \"medium\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED certificate, which may hinder his ability to fully prepare for college or employment\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"High\", \"Living alone can increase recidivism rates due to isolation and lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Marjuana use in the past four years is a significant risk factor as it can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"Medium\", \"Family dynamics, especially if strained or raised by individuals with issues, may play a role in recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
