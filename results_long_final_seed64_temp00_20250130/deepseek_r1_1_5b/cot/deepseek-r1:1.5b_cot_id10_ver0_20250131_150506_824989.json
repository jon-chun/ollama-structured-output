    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That might be a bit of a stereotype, but it could also mean he has certain traits that might help him in the future. He's been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear risk factor. Being convicted means he's already facing some sort of criminal charge, which is a big deal.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own, but combined with his other factors, it might add up to something more serious later on.\n\nHis height and weight are both below average for his age, I think. Maybe that could be a sign of some underlying health issues or stress-related problems. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. Let me check the z-scores to see if these are above average. For height, the mean is around 68 inches, so 70 would be a bit above average. His weight is below average too, with the mean being about 135 lbs. So both measurements are below average.\n\nHe's White, which might indicate he has some underlying issues or experiences that could affect his recidivism rate. But I'm not sure how much of an impact that would have.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That's a bit concerning because being single can lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty, which might make someone more likely to reoffend. But again, it's just one factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 4-year college. That suggests he's not attending college full-time, which could mean he's working or has other commitments. Maybe that affects his ability to reintegrate into society fully.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, mostly with marijuana and some time back when he felt down. That's concerning because drug use can lead to various health issues and mental health problems. It might be a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 for his entire life. That could mean he has some family history or experiences that might influence recidivism rates, but it's not something I'm familiar with affecting this much yet.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal struggles and downtimes. That's interesting because it suggests a spiritual component to his behavior, which might be a factor in recidivism.\n\nNow, putting all these together: he's been convicted once, which is a big risk. His height and weight are below average could indicate some underlying issues or stress. He's White, which might have some impact but isn't the main concern here. He's single and living alone, which adds to feelings of uncertainty. He's not attending college full-time, which might affect his ability to reintegrate. He has a history with drug use, which is serious. He lives with both parents in a small household, which could be a factor but isn't the main one here. His spiritual beliefs about God adding to his behavior are interesting but maybe not directly related.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, especially the recent drug use and the single status, he might have a higher risk of rearrest compared to someone who's been convicted once with more stable circumstances.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"height\", \"below average\", \"5 feet 10 inches tall\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"below average\", \"140 lbs\"),\n    (\"white\", \"White identity\", \"White status\"),\n    (\"single\", \"single status\", \"living alone\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"recent drug use (marijuana and time in dumps)\", \"history of drug use\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"small household (size 4)\", \"lived with both biological parents in a small household\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
