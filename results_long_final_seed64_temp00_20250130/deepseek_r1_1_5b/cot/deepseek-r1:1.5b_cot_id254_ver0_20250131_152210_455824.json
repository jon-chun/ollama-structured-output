    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black female who has been arrested four times. That seems like a lot of criminal history. I remember that Black individuals often face higher rates of recidivism compared to others, so maybe that's a significant risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and is living with her biological mother in a small household in an urban area. Marrying someone from your own family can be stressful, especially if you're not used to it. Living alone might also add pressure because of the uncertainty around housing. That could definitely affect recidivism rates.\n\nShe's enrolled in school now, which is good news for her education and future opportunities. But I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism. Maybe better job prospects or higher earnings could help with reintegration, but it's still a factor to consider.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems pretty positive. Low drug use and low depression levels are generally associated with lower recidivism rates because they reduce stress and provide mental comfort during tough times.\n\nThe person lived with her biological mother in a household of five before being arrested. That's a small family, which might mean less social support or more uncertainty about housing. It could make it harder to reintegrate into society after being released from prison.\n\nPutting this all together, she has a history of criminal behavior, is living in an urban area with possibly limited social support, and hasn't shown signs of mental health issues that would hinder recidivism. However, her positive aspects like education and low stress levels might mitigate some risks. But the high number of arrests over four years seems like a major risk factor.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the weight each factor has on recidivism rates. I think Black individuals have higher rates, but urban areas can also affect recidivism because of housing issues and social isolation. The lack of family support might be a significant barrier too. So maybe all these factors together contribute to a high risk.\n\nI'm not 100% confident about this assessment, so I should probably look up some studies or data on Black individuals with multiple arrests in urban areas. But based on the information given, it seems like she's at a higher risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Married from your own family\", \"medium\", \"High recidivism rates are common among Black individuals who have experienced family separations and may face uncertainty in housing.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother in small household\", \"medium\", \"A small family can lead to limited social support, increasing stress and uncertainty during reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in school now\", \"low\", \"Good for education and future opportunities but doesn't directly impact recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"No drug use or depression in past four years\", \"low\", \"Positive indicators of mental health that may reduce recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Urban area with limited social support\", \"medium\", \"High recidivism is common in urban areas due to housing issues and social isolation, which can hinder reintegration.\"),\n    (\"No family support before arrest\", \"medium\", \"Lack of family support can create uncertainty about housing and integration after release from prison.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
