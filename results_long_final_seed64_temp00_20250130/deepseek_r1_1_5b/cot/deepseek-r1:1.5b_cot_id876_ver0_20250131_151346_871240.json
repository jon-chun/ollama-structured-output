    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this young woman's recidivism over the next three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. That might be a bit of a stereotype, but maybe it affects how people perceive her. She's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. So, she's facing some legal issues, which could make recidivism harder because they're trying to get her out.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 115 lbs. That seems pretty light for her age, maybe even a bit underweight. Her height is about average, so that might not be too concerning. She's never been married and lives alone, which could mean she has less support from family or friends. That might make it harder to get help if needed.\n\nShe doesn't have any jobs during the year, but she used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs is a serious issue that can lead to addiction, which would definitely increase recidivism rates because people might stay away from substances longer than usual.\n\nShe's a high school graduate with a GED but isn't enrolled in college. That means she might not have access to any college resources or support, which could be a barrier if she needs help. She also considers that God has something to do with her personal life, which is interesting because it adds a religious angle to her situation.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the main risk factors are:\n\n1. Past drug use: Using drugs can lead to addiction and longer-term issues.\n2. Lack of support: Living alone might make it harder for her to get help if needed.\n3. No college enrollment: Not having access to resources could hinder her ability to recidivate.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact percentages, but I think she's at a higher risk because of her drug use and living situation. Maybe around 70%? That would mean there's a significant chance she might recidivate within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_drug_use\", \"high\", \"Her past use of marijuana and cocaine has led to addiction potential, which increases recidivism rates as individuals may stay away from substances longer than usual\"),\n    (\"lack_of_support\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might make it harder for her to get help if needed, potentially increasing the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_college_enrollment\", \"high\", \"Not having access to resources could hinder her ability to recidivate, especially if she needs help or support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
