    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's never been married and living alone, which might be concerning because single individuals often face higher risks of recidivism compared to those in relationships. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, so she lacks some of the skills needed for the job market. That could definitely contribute to recidivism because without proper training or experience, people are more likely to drop out of the labor force.\n\nShe's never been married but now living alone. I think that might mean less support from family members, which can be a big factor in criminal behavior. But again, it's not clear how much impact that has on recidivism rates.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. That seems about right for her age, but I'm not sure if body weight alone is a significant risk factor. Maybe it's more about overall health or other factors like diet.\n\nShe's never been married but now living alone. This might mean less support from family members, which could lead to criminal behavior. But again, I'm not certain how much that translates into recidivism rates.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, so she lacks some of the skills needed for the job market. That definitely sounds like a risk factor because without proper education or experience, people are more likely to leave the labor force.\n\nShe's never been married but now living alone. This might mean less support from family members, which could lead to criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism rates compared to other factors.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs is a serious issue because it can lead to addiction and mental health problems, which are associated with higher recidivism rates. But I'm not sure how much that contributes compared to other factors.\n\nShe's from an urban household of size 2. Urban areas might have different crime rates or social dynamics that could influence recidivism. But again, it's not clear how significant that is.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal life. This seems like a positive factor because it suggests she's in a place where she can make decisions and feel secure. However, I'm not sure if this directly affects recidivism rates or just her overall well-being.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the main risks seem to be lack of education/training, living alone with less support from family, using drugs, and possibly living in an urban area with different social dynamics. These could contribute to higher recidivism rates compared to someone who's never been married or living with a partner.\n\nI'm not sure how these factors stack up against each other. For example, lack of education is a big risk factor, but so are drug use and living alone. Maybe the person has a mix of these issues that make her more prone to recidivism than someone without any of them.\n\nI think I need to weigh the severity of each factor. If one factor is significantly worse than others, it might have a bigger impact on recidivism rates. But if they're all similar, maybe the overall risk isn't too high.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the factors mentioned, I would predict that this person has a moderate risk of rearrest, but not extremely high. The confidence level for this prediction is medium.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lack of education/training\", \"medium\", \"People without proper education or training are more likely to drop out of the labor force and commit to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living alone with less support from family\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to issues like substance abuse, mental health problems, and lower job security, all contributing to recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs can lead to addiction and mental health issues, which are associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"urban area social dynamics\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have different crime rates or social dynamics that could influence recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
