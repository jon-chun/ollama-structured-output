    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Black female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old arrested once but not convicted. That seems like a low recidivism rate because most people don't get caught again after their first offense. But I should consider other factors too.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and 134 lbs. That doesn't seem too tall or heavy, which might be a positive sign. Her weight is about average for her age, so that could contribute to lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Single individuals often have lower recidivism rates because they don't face the stress of being in a committed relationship. That's another factor pointing towards lower risk.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma but not in college. That might mean she hasn't had much exposure to criminal justice training, which could affect her recidivism rate. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe's 20 years old and has used drugs in the past four years, mostly marijuana. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious issues like addiction or mental health problems. She also mentioned feeling down in the dumps sometimes, which might indicate stress or anxiety related to her situation.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a small household in an urban area could mean she has limited access to resources and support systems. That might increase recidivism risk because she's isolated.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life, but I'm not sure how that translates into criminal behavior. It's possible, but it's also speculative without more information.\n\nPutting all these together: low recidivism rate from past offense, moderate weight and height, single status, limited education, drug use history, living in an urban area with limited support, and a vague religious connection. \n\nI think the overall risk isn't extremely high because she's young, has some manageable factors like being single and living alone, but her drug use and possibly her environment could still pose risks.\n\nSo, I'll assign moderate weights to each factor and predict that rearrest is likely, with a medium confidence level.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"Arrested once but not convicted.
