    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. She's never been married and living alone, which might be concerning because being single can lead to issues with support networks or family dynamics. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism specifically.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe she lacks some skills needed for the job she was in when she got arrested. That could make her less likely to reenter the workforce. Also, she's never been convicted of anything, which is a big red flag because recidivism rates are usually lower for those who've already committed crimes.\n\nShe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. That seems about right for her age, but I'm not sure how weight affects criminal behavior or recidivism rates. Maybe it's a factor in other areas, like health issues, but I don't have specific data on that.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone, which might mean she doesn't have the support system needed to handle any issues after being arrested. That could lead to feelings of isolation or uncertainty about how things will go, which might increase recidivism rates.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but not college, so maybe she hasn't developed the necessary skills for the job she was in when she got caught. This could make it harder for her to reenter society and contribute to society again. But I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism specifically.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs can sometimes lead to issues like addiction or mental health problems, which might affect someone's ability to reintegrate into society. However, I don't know if this is a significant factor in her recidivism risk.\n\nAt 20, she lived with both biological parents in a rural household of size five. That means she doesn't have access to the same support systems as people who grew up in cities or larger areas. This could lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about how to handle any issues after being arrested. But I'm not sure how this translates into recidivism risk.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her personal life, which might mean she's more focused on her own goals and less on societal expectations or support systems. This could lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about how to handle any issues after being arrested. But I don't know if this is a significant factor in her recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main factors seem to be lack of support systems (living alone, not married), lack of education or skills (high school diploma vs. college), and possibly some stress from substance use and mental health issues. These could increase recidivism rates because they lead to feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and potential negative outcomes after being caught.\n\nI'm not sure how much weight each factor carries, but I think the lack of support systems is a big one. Maybe she's at higher risk because she doesn't have the resources or networks needed to handle any issues after being arrested. But I also don't know if this translates directly into recidivism rates without more data.\n\nI'm not entirely confident about my analysis, but I think the lack of support systems and lack of education are key factors here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lack of support systems\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and not married leads to feelings of uncertainty and isolation, which can increase recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"lack of education or skills\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma without college means potential gaps in skills needed for the job, making it harder to reenter society\"),\n    (\"substance use and mental health issues\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use and lack of depression over a month may lead to stress and negative outcomes affecting recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
