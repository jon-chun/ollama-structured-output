    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested twice and has been convicted. That seems like a significant number of convictions, which might indicate some level of recidivism risk. But I'm not sure how to quantify that yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 165 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own. His height is typical for his age, and the weight seems about right as well. Maybe it's more about his physical build than anything else.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Being single might have some implications, like less support from family or friends, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism risk. It could be a factor, though.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. That suggests he's educated enough to handle the job he's currently doing, which is good for his career prospects. But does that directly relate to recidivism? Maybe not immediately.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet but has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. That means he might have some support from family, which could help him reintegrate into society. However, living alone is still concerning, especially if it's affecting his ability to work or make decisions on his own.\n\nHe's considered that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This seems like a strong statement about his beliefs and could influence how he views his future. If he believes in his own abilities and choices, that might reduce recidivism risk compared to someone who's more influenced by external factors.\n\nHe's lived with both parents in an urban area for the past four years. Urban living can have its challenges, like higher crime rates or less access to resources, but it also means there are more opportunities outside of his immediate community. Maybe that's a positive factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This suggests he's been through some stress but not necessarily facing serious issues related to recidivism. It might indicate better coping mechanisms, which could be protective.\n\nPutting this all together, I think his recidivism risk is moderate. He has a history of convictions, which is a red flag, but the other factors like living alone and possibly less support from family are mitigating some risks. However, he's still in a vulnerable position as a 21-year-old with no prior criminal history. It might be on the higher side, but not extremely so.\n\nI'm also considering that his education level and current job status could provide some stability, which might help reduce recidivism risk. But without more specific information about past crimes or other factors, it's hard to say for certain.\n\nSo, after evaluating all these points, I think the prediction is a moderate risk of rearrest. The confidence would be around 60%, considering the balance between his positive aspects and some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Married status\", \"low\", \"He has never been married and is currently living alone.
