    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this person. Let me start by breaking down all the information given.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested twice and has been convicted, which is pretty serious. She's 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 135 lbs. That seems about right for her age. She's never married and lives alone, which might mean she's more vulnerable to criminal behavior because there are fewer family members around.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem too concerning on their own. She has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe that affects her education or opportunities? But since she's 22, she might have some experience already. She hasn't been married yet, which could mean she's more independent, but it also means there are fewer people around to support her financially.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone, which I think reduces the social support she can get from family or friends. That might make her more prone to criminal behavior because there's less help available. But since she's 22, maybe she's already in some sort of situation where she could face arrest again.\n\nShe has held five jobs during the year and hasn't been in college yet. That suggests she's actively looking for work but hasn't pursued higher education. Maybe that gives her some leverage or skills to potentially get caught again if things go south.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious issues like addiction, mental health problems, and criminal behavior. She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign but still something to consider.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size three. That means there are two other family members besides her parents or grandparents. Having siblings might provide some support, but it's not enough to prevent criminal behavior entirely. Plus, since she's 22, she might have some life experience that could lead to issues.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life. That's interesting because it suggests a spiritual component to her behavior. Maybe she's influenced by her faith in some way, which could affect how she interacts with others or makes decisions about her future.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 is relatively young, so there might be more opportunities for criminal behavior.\n2. Marital status: Living alone reduces support from family members.\n3. Education level: High school diploma but not in college could mean some academic or career opportunities are limited.\n4. Previous drug use: Significant past drug use can lead to addiction and criminal behavior.\n5. Social support: Living alone might reduce social support, making it harder for someone to face arrest again.\n\nPutting this together, the person has a history of criminal behavior due to drug use, which is a major risk factor. She's young, living alone, with limited social support, and hasn't been in college yet. These factors make her more susceptible to rearrest because she lacks the necessary support systems and opportunities for development that older individuals might have.\n\nThe person has also used drugs, which can lead to addiction and criminal behavior. This is a significant risk factor. Additionally, living alone reduces social support, making it harder for someone to face arrest again. The lack of education or college experience could limit her opportunities in the future, further increasing the risk of rearrest.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would predict that this person has a high risk of rearrest within the next three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"She is relatively young and may have more opportunities for criminal behavior compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces support from family members, potentially increasing vulnerability to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma but not in college suggests some academic or career opportunities are limited\"),\n    (\"previous drug use\", \"high\", \"Significant past drug use can lead to addiction and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"social support\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces social support, making it harder for someone to face arrest again\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
