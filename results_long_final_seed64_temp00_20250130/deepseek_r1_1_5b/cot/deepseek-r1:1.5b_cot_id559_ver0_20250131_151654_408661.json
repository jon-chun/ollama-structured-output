    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. He's been arrested three times and has a high school diploma but isn't in college. That might mean he hasn't fully developed his criminal skills yet. His weight is 215 lbs, which seems about right for his height. Height can affect how active someone is, so maybe that plays a role.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which could be a risk because being single might lead to more serious issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, so he might not have the necessary skills for higher education or employment. His family size is seven, which is quite large, especially since he's an 18-year-old. That could mean he's more vulnerable to domestic violence or other issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has had some emotional struggles, feeling down sometimes. This might indicate a history of substance abuse, which can lead to criminal behavior later on. He's lived in a household of seven for his entire life, so that could be a significant risk factor. His religious beliefs are mentioned but aren't elaborated much, so I'm not sure how strong that is as a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a history of substance abuse, which is a serious issue. He's single and living alone, which can lead to more serious problems. The high school diploma might be an obstacle if he needs higher education or employment. His family size being large could mean more stressors in his life. Emotional struggles and substance use add layers of risk.\n\nI think the overall risk is high because there are multiple factors that contribute to criminal behavior, especially with substance abuse and living alone. The probability of him rearresting is likely significant.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"he has a history of marijuana use in the past four years\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"high\", \"he's currently living alone and never married\"),\n    (\"family_size_large\", \"high\", \"his family size is seven, which could lead to more stressors\"),\n    (\"emotional_stress\", \"high\", \"he has had emotional struggles and feels down in the dumps\"),\n    (\"driving_illness_or_disorders\", \"medium\", \"he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White and may have underlying health issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
