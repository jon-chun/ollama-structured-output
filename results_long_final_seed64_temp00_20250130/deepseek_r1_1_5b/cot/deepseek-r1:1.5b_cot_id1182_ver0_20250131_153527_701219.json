    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested seven times. That seems like a lot of convictions. He's 5'7\" and weighs 142 lbs. Not too tall or heavy for his age. He's never married and lives alone, which might mean less social support but could also be a strength.\n\nHe has a high school diploma without college enrollment. That means he didn't go to college, so maybe that affects his education options later on. He hasn't been in college yet, so he might have some gaps in his education.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in a household of five for 5 years and now lives alone. That could mean more stress or uncertainty about his future. He's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That's interesting because sometimes drug use can be linked to mental health issues, but he hasn't been feeling that way.\n\nHe's a 21-year-old, so he might not have much experience yet. That could mean he's more vulnerable if he gets caught again. He's from an urban area and considers God involved with his personal life. That religious aspect might add some stress or anxiety.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: substance use (marijuana), living alone, being 21, not having college enrollment, living in a small household, and considering God. These all seem like potential risks for recidivism.\n\nI think he's high on substance use because he's been using it for four years without feeling depressed. That could be a significant risk factor. Living alone might also increase his chances of reoffending due to isolation. Being 21 means he might have less experience, which is another concern. Not having college enrollment could limit his opportunities later in life. The small household and living in an urban area might contribute to stress or uncertainty.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors seem like they could increase the risk of rearrest after three years. So, I'd say yes, he has a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"he's been using marijuana for four years without feeling depressed\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"he's lived with his biological mother in a household of five and now lives alone\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"he's 21, which might mean he's more vulnerable if caught again\"),\n    (\"college_enrollment\", \"low\", \"he hasn't enrolled in college yet\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"the small household may contribute to stress or uncertainty\"),\n    (\"geographic_location\", \"medium\", \"living in an urban area could add stress and uncertainty\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
