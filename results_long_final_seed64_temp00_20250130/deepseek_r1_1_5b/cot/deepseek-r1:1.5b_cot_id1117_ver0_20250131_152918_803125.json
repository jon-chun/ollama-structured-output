Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because recidivism rates are usually higher in certain demographics and racial groups. He's 5'8\" and weighs 161 lbs, which is on the lower side for his age, so maybe that contributes to a higher risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might make him more vulnerable if he gets into trouble because there are fewer people around him to help or support. That could be a factor pointing towards recidivism.\n\nHis education level is limited\u2014no high school diploma or GED, no college enrollment, and he hasn't had any jobs during the year. This lack of education and job stability might make him more susceptible to criminal behavior in the future. So that's another risk factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has been down a bit recently\u2014so something like that could lead to recidivism, especially if he feels down or hopeless. That seems like a strong indicator of potential reoffending.\n\nHis family is from a household of size 4, which might mean there are more people around him who can assist with support, but it's not an overwhelming number either. So maybe that doesn't add much risk, but it could still affect his ability to handle situations on his own.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal life, which is interesting because some people believe in the influence of God on their behavior. However, I don't think that's a strong factor here unless there are specific beliefs about how God affects criminal behavior, which isn't mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together, he's from a lower socioeconomic background (no high school diploma), has limited education and job history, is living alone, and has been down in the dumps. These factors combined with his drug use and recent emotional state make him at higher risk for recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"His background from a lower socioeconomic level and limited education history contribute to higher recidivism risks.\",\n     \"Lower socioeconomic status, limited education, living alone, and recent emotional downcast make him at higher risk for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 161 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
