    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's an 6'0\" guy at 170 lbs, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma in college, and he's used marijuana in the past four years without feeling depressed over the last month. He comes from a household of five with his biological dad, lives in an urban area, and considers God unrelated to his personal life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is 18, which might indicate some underlying stress or anxiety, but since he's just starting out, maybe that's not too bad. He's a male, so gender-specific factors come into play more often, but here it's about age and other aspects.\n\nHe's an 6'0\" guy, which is short for his height, but in urban areas, being tall might be associated with higher risk of crime because taller people are more exposed to public spaces. But he's only 18, so maybe that's not a big issue yet.\n\nHis weight at 170 lbs seems normal, but body composition could affect recidivism. He's never married and is living alone, which might mean less family support, but again, it's just one person.\n\nHe's in a household of five with his biological dad, so he has some support from his parents. But since he's 18, maybe that's not enough to prevent recidivism. He's enrolled in college, which could indicate better academic support and possibly higher education level, but again, it's just one person.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years without feeling depressed over the last month. This is a significant risk factor because marijuana use can lead to severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety. It's also associated with criminal behavior, especially if done in a controlled environment where stress isn't present.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean less support from family members, but again, it's just one person. He considers God unrelated to his personal life, so there's no religious influence here.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors seem to be marijuana use and mental health issues like depression. These are significant because they can lead to criminal behavior, especially if done in a controlled environment where stress isn't present. The person is 18, which might indicate some underlying stress or anxiety, but since he's just starting out, it's probably not a major concern yet.\n\nI think the overall risk is high because of the significant marijuana use and mental health issues. This could lead to criminal behavior over time, especially if he continues to engage in this pattern.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"marijuana use\", \"high\", \"marijuana use can lead to severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which are associated with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental health issues\", \"high\", \"people with significant mental health issues may engage in criminal behavior despite their age and lack of family support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
