    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Black female. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as Black. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's interesting because sometimes people are arrested without being convicted, especially if they're facing serious charges. But since she's not convicted, that might mean the arrest was on a serious charge or maybe it's part of her overall behavior.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 lbs. That seems about right for a young adult. She's never been married and is living alone. That could be a risk factor because being single, living alone, and not married might lead to issues with social support or relationships in the future. But I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That means she's working or hasn't attended college for some time. That could be a risk because without higher education, she might have limited job opportunities and might struggle with personal development. But again, it's not clear if this is a major concern yet.\n\nShe's been employed three times during the year but hasn't had any jobs since then. That seems odd because if she's been working before being arrested, that could indicate some underlying issues or stress from her previous job. Maybe she's struggling with her career or personal life, which might affect her ability to work again after arrest.\n\nShe's never used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't used any during the past month. That's concerning because drug use can lead to addiction and mental health issues. But since she hasn't been arrested yet, I'm not sure if this is a factor yet or just something that could come up later.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size two. That means there are other family members besides her parents, which might indicate some social support. However, being raised by two parents and living alone could still be risky because it limits opportunities for social interaction and personal development.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personally. This is interesting because it suggests a spiritual component to her life. But I'm not sure how significant this is or if it's a risk factor in the traditional sense of recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together, I think the main risks are her previous job history, lack of education, living alone, and potential drug use. These could lead to issues with work, relationships, mental health, and social support after arrest. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, it's still unclear if rearrest is imminent.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact risk factors here because recidivism can be influenced by many variables like family dynamics, personal circumstances, and societal expectations. Without more information, it's hard to assign precise weights to each factor. But overall, I think there are some significant risks that could lead to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous job history\", \"medium\", \"She has a history of employment in the past four years, which may indicate underlying issues or stress from her previous job\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"She is not enrolled in college and has only a high school diploma, suggesting potential challenges with higher education and personal development\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be risky as it limits social support and opportunities for personal growth, which may affect her ability to work again after arrest\"),\n    (\"potential drug use\", \"low\", \"She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years or during the past month, indicating a need for caution about addiction issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
