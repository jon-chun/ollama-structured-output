    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this young Black female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She's a 20-year-old living alone with her biological mother in an urban area, holding a high school diploma, not enrolled in college, and has used drugs in the past four years, especially marijuana. She's also had some feelings of despair lately.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is a 20-year-old, which might indicate higher recidivism rates compared to younger individuals. Being Black could mean she faces more systemic issues, but since she's not convicted, maybe her race isn't the main concern here. She's never been married and living alone, which might affect her social support. The household size of 3 in an urban area could limit access to resources or opportunities.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but hasn't enrolled in college, so there's no formal education beyond that. This might mean she lacks the skills needed for higher-level jobs, especially if they're related to criminal justice. She's not been convicted yet, which is interesting because some recidivism studies show that after release, individuals can return to their previous behavior.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and has had feelings of despair lately. This could be a sign of underlying stress or mental health issues, which might contribute to recidivism. The fact that she's considered \"God has something to do with her\" suggests a personal belief system that might influence her behavior.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: age (20), living alone, limited social support, high school diploma but no college, drug use history, and feelings of despair. These seem like significant risk factors. Recidivism rates can be higher for individuals with substance abuse histories, lower for those without formal education, and more pronounced in those who feel isolated or hopeless.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the overall risk is high. The person's age, living situation, lack of education, drug use history, and feelings of despair all contribute to a higher likelihood of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The young age may indicate higher recidivism rates compared to younger individuals\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Limited social support can affect criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"no formal education\", \"low\", \"Lack of skills and opportunities for higher-level jobs\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"high\", \"Significant drug use history may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"feeling of despair\", \"medium\", \"Underlying stress or mental health issues might influence behavior\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 165 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
