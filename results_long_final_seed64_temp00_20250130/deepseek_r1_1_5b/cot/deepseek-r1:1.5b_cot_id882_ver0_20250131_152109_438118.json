Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. That might be a positive sign because it reduces stereotypes and makes him more approachable. He's never been married and living alone, which is good because being single can reduce stress and make people less likely to drive away. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe he's not fully prepared for the job market yet.\n\nHe's 6'9\" and weighs 185 lbs. That seems about right for his age, which is good. His family size is four, including himself, so that might mean he has a smaller social circle, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married, living alone, and has a high school diploma. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems like positive indicators because it shows he's independent and doesn't have immediate issues affecting his behavior.\n\nHis biological parents are in a household of size 4, which is smaller than some others but still manageable. He considers God nothing to do with his personal life, so maybe that reduces any potential conflicts or stressors from religious beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together, he's young, independent, living alone, has a good education level, and seems to have positive habits like not using drugs and feeling better emotionally. These factors suggest he might be less likely to rearrest compared to someone with more immediate issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"never been married\", \"low\", \"living alone reduces stress and makes people less likely to drive away\"),\n    (\"high school diploma but not in college\", \"medium\", \"not fully prepared for the job market yet\"),\n    (\"6'9\\\" and 185 lbs\", \"low\", \"seems about right for his age\"),\n    (\"family size of four, never been married, living alone\", \"low\", \"small social circle reduces stress\"),\n    (\"never used marijuana in past four years, never felt depressed over last month\", \"medium\", \"positive indicators of independence and emotional well-being\"),\n    (\"biological parents in household of four\", \"low\", \"smaller family size than others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
