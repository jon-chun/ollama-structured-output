    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person has a high risk of rearrest in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice. That seems like a lot for someone his age. He's 6'4\" and weighs 210 lbs. I don't know much about Black people in terms of criminal behavior, but maybe they're more likely to commit crimes because of their background.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. That might make him feel isolated, which could be a risk factor for recidivism. People who feel isolated are more likely to return to society after being away, right?\n\nHis education is up to high school and in college. Maybe that means he has some skills or knowledge, but it's not clear how that affects his criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 1 job during the year. That suggests he might have some work experience, which could be a positive factor. But if he's not doing well at work, maybe that's a risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using drugs can sometimes lead to recidivism because it makes people feel guilty or ashamed. Not feeling depressed might help them stay away from criminal activities.\n\nHe was raised by his biological mother in a household of seven, which is pretty big. Maybe that's a positive environment for him. But I'm not sure how that affects his criminal behavior specifically.\n\nOverall, he's young, has some work experience, but hasn't been arrested yet. He's living alone and might feel isolated. Using drugs could be a risk factor. Not feeling depressed might help. But without more information on specific crimes or behaviors, it's hard to say for sure if rearrest is likely.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"isolated\", \"low\", \"He may feel less connected to society and thus more susceptible to recidivism\"),\n    (\"work experience\", \"medium\", \"His job might provide some stability or skills that could contribute positively to recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"isolated\", \"low\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which are associated with higher recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Using drugs can sometimes increase the likelihood of recidivism due to guilt or shame),\n    (\"no depression\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed might help reduce recidivism risks by fostering a sense of resilience and self-efficacy\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"Medium\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
