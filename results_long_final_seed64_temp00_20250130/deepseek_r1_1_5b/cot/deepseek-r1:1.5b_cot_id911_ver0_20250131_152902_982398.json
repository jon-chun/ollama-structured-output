    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male from a white background. That might be a positive sign because being white is often associated with better health and opportunities. He hasn't been convicted yet but has been arrested once. I think that's a bit concerning because it means he's facing some legal issues, which could affect his ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. That seems about right for a young adult. His height is average, so maybe he's not too short or too tall. His weight is also within normal ranges, but I'm not sure if that's a significant factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. That might mean he has less social support, which could be a risk because it affects his ability to find new jobs or meet people for support groups. But since he's living alone, maybe that's an advantage in some ways.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That suggests he might have some work experience or skills, but it's not clear yet. His education level could affect his job prospects and ability to find employment after being arrested.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems pretty positive. He considers God to be involved with his personal life, which is a strong indicator of spiritual support and potential for better outcomes.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: substance abuse, drug use, alcohol use, delinquency, mental health issues, family problems, and living alone. The person hasn't used drugs or been depressed, so those are low risk. He's not involved in delinquencies because he's just a minor, and his family life is simple since he lives with his parents.\n\nHis age being young might be a factor too, but I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like substance use and living alone. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe the arrest itself isn't a major risk, but it's something to consider.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risks seem to be living alone and possibly substance abuse or delinquency. But since he hasn't used drugs or shown signs of delinquency, those are low. His age being young might not add much unless there's some underlying issue like substance use that's affecting his ability to reintegrate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the overall risk isn't too high. He has some positive aspects like living alone and having a spiritual support system, but he also faces some potential risks like living alone and possibly substance abuse or delinquency. However, since he hasn't shown signs of those issues yet, it's more about his current circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I would predict that this person is at risk for rearrest within the next three years because while there are some positive aspects, living alone could be a significant barrier to finding new jobs and support groups. The lack of substance abuse or delinquency makes him less likely to face those risks, but it's still something to watch out for.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\"), \n    (\"substance_abuse_or_delinquency\", \"low\", \"He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month.\") \n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
