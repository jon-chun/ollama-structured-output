    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That might be a sign of some underlying issues or cultural background that could affect his behavior. But I don't know much about Black people in criminal justice contexts, so maybe this isn't too bad.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means he's facing legal consequences, which is a risk factor. But since he's not convicted, does that mean he'll eventually get out? I'm not sure about the timeline here; he's just been arrested.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. That seems on the lower side for his age, but again, I don't know how weight affects criminal behavior off the top of my head.\n\nHis height is 5'9\", which might mean he has a certain physical build that could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's 18 years old and hasn't had any jobs yet. That's concerning because criminal behavior can start with little to no income. Plus, he's living alone, which might make him less likely to seek help from authorities or support groups.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This is a significant risk factor because many people who commit crimes lack formal education. But I don't know how this translates into recidivism rates; it's something to consider.\n\nHe has never been married, living alone, and hasn't had any jobs. That suggests he might be more isolated or vulnerable compared to someone who has relationships or support systems. But again, criminal behavior can start without any support, so that could be a risk factor.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and some of the time during the past month he felt down, which didn't help him get out. That's concerning because drug use is a serious issue, but how does it affect recidivism? I know that substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, but without conviction, it might not be as immediate.\n\nHis family is from a household of size three\u2014two biological parents and one foster or adoptive parent. That means he's raised by others, which could provide some support, but it's still limited compared to families with more support systems.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal issues. This seems like a red flag because criminal behavior is often influenced by personal beliefs and environment. If his parents or other family members are influencing him, that could make recidivism harder to predict.\n\nPutting this all together, the individual has been arrested but hasn't convicted, which is a risk factor. He's young, lacks education, is living alone, and has substance use issues. These factors suggest he might be at higher risk for recidivism compared to someone without these issues. However, I'm not sure if the arrest itself is enough on its own or if other factors like substance abuse and lack of support are more significant.\n\nI think his age, lack of education, living alone, and substance use make him a higher risk. But since he's been arrested once, maybe that doesn't add much unless it leads to conviction. Without conviction, the recidivism rate might be lower than someone who has been convicted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested but hasn't been convicted, which is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"His lack of formal education could contribute to criminal behavior and higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living in an isolated household may reduce support systems and increase vulnerability to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use issues\", \"medium\", \"His recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack of support from family\", \"medium\", \"The family's size and composition provide limited support, which could impact his recidivism likelihood.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
