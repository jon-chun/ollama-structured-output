    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male from a white background. That might be a positive sign because being white is often associated with better opportunities and less discrimination in some areas. He's been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear risk. But I'm not sure how much weight to give him based on his age.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 128 lbs. That seems about right for a 20-year-old, but maybe he's in a smaller city or rural area where people are generally lighter. I don't know if that affects recidivism much though.\n\nHis height is 5'7\", which is taller than average for his age, so that might be a plus. His weight is 128 lbs, which is below the average of about 140-160 lbs for males my age. Maybe he's in a smaller area or has different body types.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. That could mean he's more independent, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism. He's got a high school diploma and isn't in college, so maybe he didn't attend school early enough. But again, I don't know if that's a big factor.\n\nHe's been employed four times during the year, which is a bit low for someone his age. Maybe he started as a student or something. He's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems concerning because using drugs can be a serious issue, but I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism.\n\nHe lives in a household of size 4 with rural neighbors. That might mean he has more family members around him, which could affect his behavior or relationships. But again, I don't know the specifics about how that ties into recidivism.\n\nHis biological parents lived together for four years when he was born. That's interesting because it shows a strong family bond from birth. Maybe that contributes positively to his development and behavior.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. That could be a positive factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is in predicting recidivism. It might just be a way of living rather than an actual influence on behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, he's been arrested once, which is a clear risk. His age and weight seem okay, but maybe his lack of education or lack of job history could play into it. The family background with rural neighbors might also have some impact. However, I'm not sure if the overall picture leans towards recidivism.\n\nI think he's at higher risk because he's been arrested once, which is a significant event in criminal justice. His age and weight are within normal ranges, but his lack of education or job history could be problematic. The family background might have some support, but without more information on how that ties into recidivism, it's hard to say.\n\nI'm leaning towards him being at higher risk because he's been arrested once, which is a clear sign of potential reoffending. His lack of education or job history could make him less likely to reintegrate into society, especially if he's living alone and hasn't had much support from his family.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20-year-old male with a reasonable age for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"128 lbs is below average for a 20-year-old\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"strong family bond from birth and rural living support\"),\n    (\"drugs use\", \"medium\", \"consistent marijuana use over the past four years\"),\n    (\"job history\", \"medium\", \"low number of jobs during the year suggests possible lack of education or job history\"),\n    (\"lifestyle factors\", \"medium\", \"living alone with no significant support from family and rural living environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
