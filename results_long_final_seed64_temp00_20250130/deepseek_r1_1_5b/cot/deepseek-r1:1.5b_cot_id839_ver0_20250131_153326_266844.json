    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That might be a bit concerning because gender and race can sometimes influence criminal behavior, but it doesn't necessarily mean he'll rearrest. He has been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear sign of past criminal history. That should increase his risk.\n\nNext, he's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That seems about right for a 20-year-old male. His weight is within the normal range, which suggests he doesn't have an underlying health issue that would make him more likely to commit crimes.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marrying someone could introduce new social dynamics, but it also means he might face different challenges in the future. Living alone can be stressful, especially if he's dealing with substance use. That stress might affect his ability to reintegrate into society or make decisions about his future.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This could mean he hasn't had much exposure to criminal justice education, which is important for understanding law and preventing recidivism. Without that foundation, he might face more challenges in the future.\n\nHe's not employed during the past year but worked part-time last month. That suggests he has some work experience, which can sometimes be a sign of stability or potential. However, it doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior.\n\nHe's been using drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and has used them more recently, feeling down in the dumps. This substance use history is significant because drug use often correlates with criminal behavior. His recent experience with substance abuse might have made him more vulnerable to recidivism.\n\nHis family background: he lived with his biological mother in a household of size four in a rural area and considers God unrelated to his personal life. That could mean he's isolated or has a different perspective on his experiences, which might affect his decision-making and behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the individual has a clear past criminal history, which is a strong indicator of risk. His substance use history adds another layer of concern. However, these factors are not overwhelming enough to significantly increase his rearrest risk. The other factors like age, weight, living situation, education, and family background seem manageable but don't outweigh the significant past criminal history.\n\nTherefore, I would assess his risk as moderate. The factors point towards a higher likelihood of recidivism, especially given his substance use history and possibly his stress from living alone or dealing with substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_crime\", \"high\", \"individual has a clear past criminal history that significantly increases their risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\", \"his recent experience with substance abuse adds another layer of concern\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"he lived with his biological mother in a rural area and considers god unrelated to his personal life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
