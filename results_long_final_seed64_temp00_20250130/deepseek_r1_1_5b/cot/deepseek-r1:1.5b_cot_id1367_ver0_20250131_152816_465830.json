    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male who's been arrested five times. He's a 6-foot-1-inch guy at 230 lbs, never married, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, hasn't taken college yet, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, didn't feel depressed over the last month, and lived with his biological mother in a small family in an urban area. He considers God involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. Let's start with substance use. He's been using drugs for four years, which is concerning because drug use can lead to addiction, dependency, and sometimes recidivism. But since he hasn't felt depressed over the last month, maybe his mental health isn't the main issue here.\n\nNext, his family background. He's lived in a small family of size 4, which might mean less support from family members or higher individual responsibility. That could affect his sense of security and motivation to stay away from drugs or alcohol. But since he's living alone, maybe that's mitigated some way.\n\nHis age is young, so he might have lower self-efficacy compared to older individuals. Lower self-efficacy can lead to less motivation to engage in risky behaviors like drug use. However, his biological mother lived with him, which could provide some emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation or burden.\n\nHis education level: He's a 19-year-old without a high school diploma or GED. That might mean he hasn't developed the skills needed for higher education or employment, but since he's not enrolled in college yet, maybe that's less of an issue. However, lower education levels can sometimes lead to lower job prospects and increased risk of criminal behavior.\n\nHis living situation: He's living alone, which is a significant risk factor because it reduces social support, increases feelings of isolation, and makes it harder to stay motivated or find help if needed. But since he's in an urban area with a family of four, maybe the isolation isn't as severe as in rural areas.\n\nHis religious background: He considers God involved, which might mean he has some sense of purpose or guidance. However, his substance use and lack of social support could still pose risks to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, while his substance use is concerning, especially since he hasn't felt depressed, his family background, living alone status, lower education level, and religious considerations might contribute to a higher risk of recidivism. However, the lack of social support from a small family could mitigate some of these risks. But given that he's been arrested five times, which is a significant number, it seems like there are enough factors pointing towards a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the weight each factor has on recidivism, but I think his substance use and lack of social support might be more impactful. So, overall, I'd say yes, he's at a higher risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"His drug use over four years is concerning, especially since he hasn't felt depressed in the past month.
