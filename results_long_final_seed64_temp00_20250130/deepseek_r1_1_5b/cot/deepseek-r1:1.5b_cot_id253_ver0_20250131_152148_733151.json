    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. He's been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted yet. That's interesting because it shows he's tried multiple times but isn't facing immediate consequences. His age is young, which might mean he has some underlying issues or experiences that could affect recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own, but I should consider if his physical attributes are a significant risk factor. Maybe someone with a certain build is more prone to criminal behavior? Not sure yet.\n\nHis height isn't an issue here because he's not tall, so that probably doesn't contribute much. His weight seems normal, but again, it's just one of many factors.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. That might mean he has some social support or experiences from being in a different environment. But I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could be a significant factor because many people with lower education levels face higher barriers to criminal behavior. Maybe his lack of education has made him more vulnerable?\n\nHe's never been married, so he might not have experienced the stress of being single or living with someone else. That could mean less social pressure and potentially better mental health outcomes. But I'm not sure if that directly affects recidivism risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but has used marijuana. Using substances can be a serious issue, especially if they're related to addiction. His lack of feeling depressed over the past month might indicate he's managing his emotions better, which could help with recidivism.\n\nHis family is from a household of size five in an urban area where God doesn't have anything to do with it. This seems like a strong statement about his upbringing and environment. Maybe this has influenced his behavior or experiences growing up. But I'm not sure how directly that affects recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the main risks seem to be related to his lack of education, lack of substance use history, and family background. These could make him more vulnerable to criminal behavior in the future. However, he's been arrested five times without conviction, which is a significant number but not impossible. His age being young might also play a role, as younger people often face different challenges.\n\nI'm leaning towards a medium risk because while there are some underlying factors like education and substance use, they aren't overwhelming. The arrest history shows he's tried multiple times, but it hasn't been successful yet. His family background is strong, which could contribute to his recidivism risk.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I think the prediction should be a medium risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"His lack of education may have made him more vulnerable to criminal behavior in the future.\"),\n    (\"lack of substance use history\", \"medium\", \"He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but he has used marijuana.
