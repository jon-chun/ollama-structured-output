    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because being arrested again could lead to recidivism. His height and weight are normal, so that doesn't seem like an issue. He's never married yet, which might mean he's not in a stable relationship, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nHis age is young, 21, which is on the younger side, but since he's Hispanic, maybe his background has some advantages. The household size is five, and he's living in an urban area. That could mean he's dealing with a lot of stress or uncertainty from being in a big city. He's not living alone, so that might help him feel more secure.\n\nHe's never been married yet, which I think means he's not in a stable relationship, but maybe he has other social connections. The person he lived with as an adoptive parent is in a household of five, which could be a significant family unit. He's from a young age living with his parents, so that might have some psychological impact.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems like a positive factor because using substances can sometimes lead to stress or anxiety, but it doesn't necessarily mean he'll recidivate. He's enrolled in college, which is good for education, but I'm not sure how that ties into criminal behavior.\n\nHis job history has four jobs during the year, and he's used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. That could indicate some substance abuse issues, which might contribute to recidivism. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so his mental health is stable, which is a positive sign.\n\nHe's from a young age living with his parents, which might have some psychological benefits but also stress. The person he lived with as an adoptive parent is in a family of five, which could mean more uncertainty and stress. He considers God to have something to do with his personal life, so that adds a spiritual component.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors seem to be recidivism due to being arrested twice, substance abuse (marijuana), and possibly living in an urban area where there might be higher rates of criminal behavior. However, he's from a young age with his parents, which could mitigate some stress but not necessarily recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards yes because while he has some positive factors like stable family life and education, the significant arrest history and substance use indicate potential risks. But I'm not entirely sure if it's high confidence or low. Maybe medium confidence since there are multiple risk factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"recidivism due to being arrested twice\", \"high\", \"the significant arrest history indicates a higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance abuse (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"his use of marijuana in the past four years may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living in an urban area with higher criminal behavior rates\", \"high\", \"this could lead to increased recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
