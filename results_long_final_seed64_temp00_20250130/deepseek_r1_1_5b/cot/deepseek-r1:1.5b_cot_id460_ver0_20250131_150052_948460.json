    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person has a high risk of rearrest in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. He's never been married and living alone isn't an issue here. He has a GED and hasn't enrolled in college, which might be a concern because higher education can lead to better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates. But I'm not sure how significant that is.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 204 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own. His family size isn't huge either\u2014household of six, which might mean he has a lot of close family members around him. He's from an urban area, so maybe he's more exposed to crime or social issues there.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because recidivism rates can vary based on how long someone is in prison. If they're released soon, their risk might be lower. But if they stay in jail for three years, that could significantly increase the risk.\n\nHe's a 20-year-old, so he's young and hasn't lived with his biological mother as a child. That might mean he has less exposure to family dynamics or domestic violence issues. He's used drugs\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Using drugs can sometimes lead to recidivism because it can affect mental health, which is a big factor.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in an urban household of six. Urban areas might have higher crime rates or more opportunities for criminal activity compared to rural areas. But he's not living alone, so that could mitigate some risks.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year and hasn't enrolled in college. Having multiple jobs can provide stability but doesn't necessarily mean lower recidivism rates. However, without a degree might limit his job opportunities or higher education could lead to better career prospects and lower recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: he's young, from an urban family, has some substance use issues, lived with his biological mother, and hasn't enrolled in college. These factors seem like they could contribute to a higher risk of rearrest. The arrest history is one, but without conviction, it might not be as significant. However, the lack of education and potential drug use could make him more vulnerable.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because he's young, from an urban area with possible exposure, has substance use issues, and hasn't enrolled in college. These factors together suggest that his recidivism risk is higher than average.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young\", \"low\", \"high\"),\n    (\"from urban area\", \"medium\", \"moderate\"),\n    (\"substance use issues\", \"medium\", \"moderate\"),\n    (\"not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"low\"),\n    (\"lived with biological mother\", \"low\", \"low\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
