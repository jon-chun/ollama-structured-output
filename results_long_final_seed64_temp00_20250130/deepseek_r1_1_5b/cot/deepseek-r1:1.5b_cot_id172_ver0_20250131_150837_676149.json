    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this young Hispanic female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She's a 19-year-old, Hispanic, living alone in an urban area with four people in her household. She's never married and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. She's lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents for four years. She used marijuana in the past four years and has been feeling down sometimes that nothing could cheer her up, especially since she's young.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. Let me list them out:\n\n1. **Age**: 19 is relatively young, which can be a risk for recidivism.\n2. **Ethnicity**: Hispanic background might have some protective factors if there are studies supporting it.\n3. **Marital status**: She's never married, so that could be a positive factor.\n4. **Living alone**: High risk of being isolated and at higher risk for recidivism.\n5. **No high school diploma/GED**: This is a significant risk factor because lack of education can lead to criminal behavior.\n6. **Lived with non-citizens or foster/adoptives**: This might be a protective factor if the family is stable, but it's not perfect.\n7. **Drug use history**: She used marijuana in the past four years and has been feeling down recently.\n8. **Social support**: She's living alone, which could mean less social support.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights to each factor based on my understanding:\n\n- **Age (19)**: Medium risk because 19 is young but not extremely so.\n- **Ethnicity (Hispanic)**: Low risk if there are studies supporting it, but maybe medium if other protective factors are considered.\n- **Marital status (Never married)**: High risk since being single can lead to higher recidivism rates.\n- **Living alone**: High risk because living with others increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n- **No high school diploma/GED**: Medium risk, but it's a significant factor that needs to be addressed.\n- **Lived with non-citizens/foster/adoptives**: Low risk if family is stable, but it's not perfect.\n- **Drug use history (Marijuana in past four years)**: High risk because drug use can lead to recidivism.\n- **Social support**: Low risk since she's living alone.\n\nNow, I'll combine these factors. The highest risks are age, living alone, and drug use. These seem like the most significant contributors. However, the lack of a high school diploma/GED is also a major risk factor that needs to be addressed. So overall, this person has a moderate to high risk of recidivism.\n\nI think the prediction should be \"YES\" because she's in a vulnerable situation with multiple high-risk factors. The confidence level would be medium because while there are significant risks, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"19 years is relatively young but not extremely so, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic background may have protective factors if supported by research\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"never married increases risk of isolation and reoffending\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"high\", \"single living with others is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED\", \"medium\", \"lack of education can lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Lived with non-citizens/foster/adoptives\", \"low\", \"family stability may mitigate risks\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"high\", \"marijuana use in past four years and recent downing are significant risk factors\"),\n    (\"Social support\", \"low\", \"living alone reduces social support for reoffending\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
