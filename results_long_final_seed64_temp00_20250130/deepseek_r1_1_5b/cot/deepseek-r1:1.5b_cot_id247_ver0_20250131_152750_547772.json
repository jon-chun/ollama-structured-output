    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male with a White identity. That might be a bit of a stereotype, but maybe it affects his behavior. He's been arrested twice and convicted, so that's a clear risk factor. Being charged again could lead to recidivism.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marital issues can sometimes affect someone's behavior, especially if they're dealing with their spouse's problems. But I'm not sure how much that contributes to recidivism compared to other factors like substance abuse or mental health.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 275 lbs. That might put him at a higher risk for certain conditions related to physical health, but again, I'm not sure if that's the main factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. That could mean he lacks some skills or knowledge, which might affect his ability to handle situations on his own. But maybe it's more about his education level than personal risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't been engaged in substance abuse for four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a big risk factor because it can lead to relapse. His lack of depression over the past month might be a bit concerning, but I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism compared to other issues like substance use.\n\nHe's married in a household of size 5, which could mean he has some support systems or less stress. But again, I'm not sure if that directly affects his recidivism risk.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. That might be more of an influence on his behavior rather than a direct risk factor for recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be being arrested twice and convicted, substance abuse, and possibly mental health issues like depression. These are clear indicators that he's at higher risk for relapse or rearrest.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES because these factors significantly increase his risk of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested twice\", \"high\", \"being charged again could lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance abuse (marijuana, cocaine)\", \"high\", \"this can lead to relapse and rearrest\"),\n    (\"mental health issues (no feeling depressed over the past month)\", \"medium\", \"though less direct than substance use\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
