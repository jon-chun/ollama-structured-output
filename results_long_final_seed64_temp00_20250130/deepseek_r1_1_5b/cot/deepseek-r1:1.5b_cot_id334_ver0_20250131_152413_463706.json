    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is pretty serious. He's 6'4\" and weighs 190 lbs. Not too big for his age, but maybe that affects how he interacts with others. He's never married and lives alone, so no family support or social networks to fall back on.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which might mean he's not fully prepared for the job market yet. He's used to drugs\u2014marjuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting because drug use can be a significant stressor, but it also depends on how it affects him emotionally.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in a household of size five in an urban area. That might mean he has some social support or at least not living alone for too long. He considers God to have something to do with his personal life, which is unusual but could be a positive factor.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: substance use disorder (marijuana and cocaine), living alone, high school diploma, no college, drug use history, depression, family support, urban residence, and belief in God. \n\nSubstance use is significant because it can lead to recidivism. Living alone might make him more vulnerable if he's not supported financially or socially. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which could be an issue for job opportunities. No college means he might struggle with finding a stable job later on.\n\nHis drug use history is three years ago, so it hasn't affected him much yet. But it can still have long-term effects. Depression over the past month is concerning because it's a common stressor and can lead to relapse if not managed properly.\n\nFamily support isn't an issue here since he's living alone. Urban residence might mean he has access to certain resources or social networks, but that's speculative. His belief in God could be seen as positive, but I'm not sure how it directly affects his recidivism risk factors.\n\nPutting this together, substance use is a major risk factor because it can lead to reoffending. Living alone and no college are also significant risks. Depression over the past month adds another layer of concern. Family support isn't an issue here, so that's good news for some factors but not others.\n\nI think the overall risk is high because multiple factors contribute to recidivism. The person has substance use history, which is a clear indicator of potential reoffending. Living alone and no college are also strong indicators. Depression over the past month adds another stressor. Family support isn't an issue here, so that's a plus.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would predict a high risk of rearrest after three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"substance use history is a clear indicator of potential reoffending\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"living alone and no college are significant risks for recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_college\", \"high\", \"no college means struggling to find stable jobs later on\"),\n    (\"depression_over_past_month\", \"high\", \"depression over the past month adds another stressor\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"family support isn't an issue here, so that's a plus for some factors but not others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
