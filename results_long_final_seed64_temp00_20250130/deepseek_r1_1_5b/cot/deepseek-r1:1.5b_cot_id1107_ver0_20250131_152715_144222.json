    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. He's married, living with his spouse, doesn't have a high school diploma, isn't in college, has held five jobs, usedcocaine in the past four years, and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. At a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of seven in an urban area, and God is involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is Hispanic, which might have some connection to crime rates, but I'm not sure how significant that is. He's 19, married, living with his spouse\u2014maybe these factors contribute to criminal behavior. Not having a high school diploma or GED could be a concern because education often correlates with lower crime rates.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it shows he's tried but didn't succeed. The fact that he's married and living with his spouse might indicate some level of control, which could influence criminal behavior. Not having a college degree or diploma is another factor\u2014maybe someone without education has lower opportunities for advancement, including criminal activity.\n\nHe's lived with both parents in a small household in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's something to consider. Usingcocaine in the past four years could be a significant risk because it's a drug that can lead to serious issues like addiction and criminal behavior. Not feeling depressed over the last month might indicate stress or anxiety, which could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age living with both parents suggests he may have less support at home, which could affect his ability to handle responsibilities and potentially commit crimes later in life. God being involved\u2014maybe he's influenced by family dynamics or personal beliefs affecting his behavior.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: being Hispanic might not be the main issue, but maybe it does play a role. Marriage and living with spouse could contribute to criminal behavior. Lack of education is another concern. Urban area and cocaine use are significant risks. Not feeling depressed might be less concerning than stress or anxiety. Young age living with parents could be a vulnerability.\n\nI think these factors add up to a high risk of recidivism, especially considering the arrest history without conviction. The combination of past criminal behavior, lack of education, and possibly family dynamics involving God could significantly increase the likelihood of re-arresting.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Hispanic\", \"medium\", \"Criminal behavior in Hispanic communities may influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Married\", \"low\", \" married status can contribute to criminal behavior through control and support issues\"),\n    (\"No High School Diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"Lower education levels are often associated with lower crime rates, but this factor still needs evaluation\"),\n    (\"Urban Area\", \"high\", \" urban environments typically have higher crime rates, which could significantly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\" Cocaine Use\", \"medium\", \"cocaine use is a significant risk as it can lead to serious issues like addiction and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Not Feeling Depressed\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed over the last month might indicate stress or anxiety, which could contribute to criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
