    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. That might be a positive sign because it reduces stereotypes and makes him more approachable. He's been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear risk factor. Being charged with something serious could lead to rearrest.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. That seems healthy for his age, but I'm not sure if it affects recidivism. Maybe he's in good shape, which is a plus.\n\nHis height and weight are within normal ranges, so that doesn't seem like a major risk factor. He's never married and lives alone, which might mean he has less social support at home. That could be a concern because he might feel isolated or not have enough connections to help him rejoin society.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college, but he hasn't completed his degree yet. That's a significant gap, so that's definitely a risk factor. He needs to work towards completing his education, which could delay his recidivism.\n\nHe's been using marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs can sometimes lead to issues like addiction or mental health problems, but he hasn't shown signs of those yet. That might be a warning sign rather than a clear risk factor.\n\nAt age 18, he lived with both biological parents in an urban household of size six. Urban living can have its pros and cons; maybe it's manageable for him. He considers God to have something to do with his personal life, which is interesting but not necessarily a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet, so that might mean he doesn't have the social support he needs to rejoin society. That could be a significant concern because he might feel isolated or not connected enough to help him get back on track.\n\nHis past drug use and lack of depression don't indicate a clear recidivist risk. He's been arrested once, but that's just one case. The risk factors are more about his current state rather than the number of arrests.\n\nPutting it all together, he has some positive aspects like being White, healthy weight, living alone, and having a high school diploma. But there are significant concerns like needing to complete education, living with both parents in an urban area, not being married yet, and possibly using drugs which might lead to issues.\n\nI think the main risk factors here are his need for education, living situation, and potential drug use. These could make him more likely to rearrest. However, he's already been arrested once, so that's a clear risk factor. The other concerns add to the overall risk but aren't as severe as needing education.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I would predict a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"need for education\", \"medium\", \"he is in college and needs to complete it before being able to rejoin society\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"he lives alone and may feel isolated from others\"),\n    (\"potential drug use\", \"low\", \"he has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't shown signs of addiction or mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family living situation\", \"medium\", \"he is in an urban household of size six with both biological parents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
