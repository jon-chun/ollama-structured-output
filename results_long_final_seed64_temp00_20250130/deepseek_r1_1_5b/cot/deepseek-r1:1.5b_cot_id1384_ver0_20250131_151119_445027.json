Let me go through her details step by step.\n\nShe's a 19-year-old female from an American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut background. That might be a bit of a cultural factor, but I don't know much about that. She's been arrested twice without conviction and is now facing rearrest. That seems like a high risk because being arrested again could mean she'll have to serve time or face some kind of punishment.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might make her less likely to get into college or work, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism. She's married and living with her spouse, so maybe that gives her some support system, but I don't know if that's enough.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which could be a barrier for getting into better jobs or education later on. That might make it harder for her to reenter the workforce or find better opportunities after being released from prison.\n\nShe has held one job during the year and hasn't had much experience yet. That's a bit concerning because if she doesn't have relevant work experience, it could make recidivism higher. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like her criminal history or background.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and has been using them more recently when feeling down. That's a strong indicator of substance use disorder (SUD), which can lead to recidivism because it affects mental health, motivation, and ability to work. That seems like a significant risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might make her less likely to get into better jobs or education later on. But I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism compared to other factors like substance use disorder.\n\nShe's from a rural area where she lived with her biological mother in a household of size three. That could mean some stress and living conditions, but it might also provide some support. However, I don't know if that's enough to mitigate recidivism risk.\n\nOverall, the main risks seem to be her criminal history (two arrests without conviction), substance use disorder, and possibly lower education level. These factors all contribute to a higher likelihood of rearrest compared to someone with a high school diploma or GED.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"having been arrested twice without conviction increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"substance use disorder\", \"high\", \"using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates potential for substance abuse, which can lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"lower education level\", \"medium\", \"a lack of high school diploma or GED may affect career opportunities and job stability later in life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.
