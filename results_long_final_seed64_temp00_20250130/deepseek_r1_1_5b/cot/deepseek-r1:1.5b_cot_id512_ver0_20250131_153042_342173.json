    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Black male who's lived with non-biological parents. He's a 20-year-old, has been arrested once, and is currently facing rearrest. He's 5'10\" and weighs 151 lbs. He's never married, living alone, high school diploma, not in college, held three jobs, no drug use in the past four years, and feels down a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors that could affect his recidivism. Since he's Black, maybe there are some systemic issues affecting him. But since he's 20, it might be more about personal circumstances like living alone or not having support from others.\n\nHe's lived with non-biological parents in a small household of three. That seems like a significant risk because being left alone can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are linked to recidivism. He's never married, so no romantic support either. That could make him feel isolated more.\n\nHis family size is small, which might mean less support from his parents or other family members. He's not in college, so he doesn't have access to higher education resources that some people use as a protective factor. This lack of access could contribute to recidivism because it limits opportunities for reintegration into society.\n\nHe's never used drugs in the past four years and feels down all the time. Feeling down might indicate low motivation or emotional instability, which can affect decision-making and behavior. Low motivation is a risk factor because people who feel emotionally drained are less likely to engage in criminal activities.\n\nHis family size being small could also mean that he doesn't have access to support from his extended family, including grandparents or other relatives. This lack of support might make him more vulnerable to recidivism as he can't rely on others for help.\n\nHe's a 20-year-old, which is relatively young. Young people often face unique challenges like feeling isolated and having less time to seek out opportunities for reintegration into society. This could increase the risk of rearrest because they might feel trapped or unprepared.\n\nHis high school diploma suggests some education, but it's not enough for higher education. Without access to higher education resources, he might struggle to find pathways back to the workforce or improve his job prospects, which are important factors in recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and living alone could mean that he doesn't have any romantic support, which is another risk factor. Being left alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and decreased motivation, both of which contribute to recidivism.\n\nHis lack of support from family members might limit his opportunities for reintegration into society. He might not know how to seek help or resources, making him more vulnerable to criminal behavior once he's released.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014living alone, small family size, lack of support, emotional instability, and young age\u2014the risk seems high. The combination of living in a small household without support from extended families, feeling isolated, and having low motivation makes it difficult for him to reintegrate into society or improve his job prospects.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES because all these factors contribute significantly to rearrest recidivism. The confidence level would be medium-high since while some factors are present, others like lack of support from extended families might have a more pronounced impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living in a small household without support from extended family can significantly increase the risk of recidivism as it limits opportunities for reintegration into society and provides less emotional support for individuals\"),\n    (\"small family size\", \"low\", \"A small family may limit access to higher education resources, which are important for reintegration into society.
