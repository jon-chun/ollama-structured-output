    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old Black female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a high risk because being arrested again could mean she'll face more serious consequences. But I'm not sure if that's the only factor here.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 160 lbs, which is on the lower side for her age. Maybe that affects how she interacts with others or handles situations. Her height might make her less active in social settings compared to shorter people, but I'm not certain about that.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone, which could mean she has fewer support networks around her. That might increase the risk of being isolated or dependent on others for support. But again, I'm not sure if living alone is a significant factor here.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. Maybe that limits her opportunities and knowledge, increasing the likelihood of needing more time to learn or face challenges. However, she's not pursuing any degrees beyond that, so maybe it's less impactful than I thought.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems like a positive factor because substance abuse can lead to recidivism, and feeling depressed might also affect her behavior or mental health, which could contribute to reoffending.\n\nThe household is of size 3, including her biological mother, which means she's in a small family setting. This could make it easier for her to seek help but might also limit the resources available to her. However, I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her personal life, which suggests she doesn't place much faith in external influences affecting her behavior. That could be a negative factor because it limits her ability to seek help or change her circumstances on her own.\n\nPutting all these together, I think the main risk factors are being arrested again and living alone. These seem like significant factors that would increase the likelihood of rearrest. However, she's never been married, so maybe that's less impactful than living alone. Her education level might also play a role if she needs more time to develop skills.\n\nI'm not sure about her substance use or depression status enough to make a strong judgment on recidivism. But given the other factors, I think there's a higher chance of rearrest. So, my prediction would be yes, with some confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being arrested again\", \"high\", \"arrested once but hasn't been convicted\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"lived alone and has never been married\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
