    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. She's never been convicted of anything but has been arrested once. That seems like a low risk because being caught again might not be that bad if they're just trying to get out. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 155 lbs. That doesn't seem too high or too low for her age, so maybe that's a medium risk factor. Her height is average, which might mean she has some mobility issues if she gets into trouble, but I'm not certain.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. That could be a significant risk because being single can lead to more serious issues like domestic violence or substance abuse problems. But again, I'm not sure how that translates to rearrest risk.\n\nHer education level is a Bachelor's degree, which isn't too bad, but she hasn't completed college yet. That might mean she has some underlying issues that could affect her ability to reintegrate into society after being caught again. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's not enrolled in college and has held 4 jobs during the year. This suggests she's employed for at least three years, which is better than someone who hasn't been working at all. But I'm not sure how that affects rearrest risk.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, but only a little bit recently. That seems concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues and mental health problems. The fact that she's used them mostly recently might mean she's dealing with some stress or anxiety from her recent experiences.\n\nShe's also had some time during the past month where she felt so down in the dumps, nothing could cheer her up. That emotional state could make it harder for her to get back into a job or find a stable home, which are both important steps in reintegrating after being caught again. So this might be a high risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: she's low on age and education but has some substance use issues that could lead to serious problems. The single status and recent emotional downfall add more weight to the rearrest risk. I'm leaning towards a high confidence prediction because of her substance use history, which is a major risk factor.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"substance use history has been a significant concern for this individual\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"recent emotional downfall has significantly impacted her ability to reintegrate\"),\n    (\"single_status\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"single status and recent emotional distress have increased rearrest risk\"),\n    (\"driving_history\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"no driving history suggests manageable risks\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"unemployment rate is low, indicating potential for reintegration\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
