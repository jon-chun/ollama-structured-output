    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's an 6'1\" guy at 165 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED, not in college, used marijuana in the past four years, doesn't feel depressed over the last month, and comes from a household of six in an urban area with his biological parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor. The person is 18, which might indicate some underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. He's never married, so he might not have access to family support or social networks. Living alone could be a significant risk because it reduces opportunities for social interaction and can lead to feelings of isolation.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years, which is concerning because it's a drug that can cause severe side effects like addiction. His lack of depression over the last month suggests he might not have mental health issues, but substance abuse could still be a concern.\n\nThe family comes from a small household of six in an urban area with his biological parents. Urban living can lead to stress and social isolation, which are both risk factors for recidivism. He has a GED, so education is a factor, but without higher education or credentials, it might limit opportunities for reentry into the criminal justice system.\n\nHe's never married, so he doesn't have access to family support networks that could help him reintegrate. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and uncertainty about his future, which are both negative indicators of recidivism risk factors.\n\nPutting this together, the person has substance abuse history, no higher education, living alone, and a small family. These factors suggest he's at high risk for recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"he has used marijuana in the past four years\"),\n    (\"no_higher_education\", \"he is not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"he is currently living alone\"),\n    (\"small_family\", \"the household of six indicates urban living and potential isolation\"),\n    (\"low_familial_support\", \"he has never married, limiting access to family networks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
