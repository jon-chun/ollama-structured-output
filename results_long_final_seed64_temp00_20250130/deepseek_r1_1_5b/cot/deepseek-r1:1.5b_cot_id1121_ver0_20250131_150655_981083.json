    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this young Black male who's been arrested but hasn't been convicted. He's a 19-year-old living alone in an urban area with his biological mother, no high school diploma, and has no jobs or substance use history. He doesn't feel depressed either.\n\nFirst, I think about his age. At 19, he might be more likely to engage in criminal behavior because of the maturity level. But since he's Black, maybe there are some underlying factors that could affect recidivism. His living situation alone is a risk because being alone can lead to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHis lack of education and employment makes him vulnerable. Without skills, he might not be able to reintegrate into society. Also, his family background as a Black man might have some negative effects on recidivism rates in that area.\n\nHe's living alone, which is another significant risk factor. Alone living can lead to substance abuse or other issues like substance dependence. His lack of jobs and education means he can't contribute to the community, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis depression history isn't too bad, but it's something to consider. If he's feeling down, that might affect his decision-making and behavior towards law enforcement.\n\nPutting this all together, I think recidivism is likely for him. He's at a high risk because of age, living alone, lack of education, and family background. His arrest without conviction adds another layer of risk. The confidence in this prediction would be medium-high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19-year-old male with maturity level\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"high\", \"lived alone in an urban area with a family of size 5\"),\n    (\"family Background\", \"low\", \"Black male from a Black family\"),\n    (\"drugs Use\", \"low\", \"no history of substance use\"),\n    (\"depression History\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"education Level\", \"low\", \"no high school diploma or GED certificate\"),\n    (\"job History\", \"low\", \"never worked or had a job during the year\"),\n    (\"family Background\", \"low\", \"no high school diploma or GED certificate\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
