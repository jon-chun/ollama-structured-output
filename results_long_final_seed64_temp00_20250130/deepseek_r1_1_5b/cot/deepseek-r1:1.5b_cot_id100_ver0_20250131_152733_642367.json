Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male from an American Indian/Esperanto/Aleut background. That might be a bit of a cultural stereotype, but it could also mean he has some unique strengths or traits that might help him in the future. I'm not sure how significant this is yet, though.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's pretty high for someone his age. He's never been married and lives alone without a job. No college degree or GED, which means he's at a lower educational level compared to others in his situation. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems like a mix of substance use and mental health issues.\n\nHe's from a household of size 8, so maybe that affects how he interacts with others or how he handles stress. But I'm not sure if that's a significant risk factor here.\n\nNow, looking at each factor:\n\n1. Cultural background: Maybe this is a positive thing because it could mean he has some resilience or skills.\n2. Age and arrest history: High recidivism rates can sometimes be due to age, but also other factors like substance use.\n3. No education: This might limit his opportunities in the future, which could increase rearrest risk.\n4. Living alone: That's a big risk because it limits access to support systems and resources.\n5. Substance use history: marijuana is a form of drug, so that's definitely a risk factor.\n6. Mental health issues: Not feeling depressed over the past month might be a positive, but if he hasn't felt better since then, it could indicate some mental health challenges.\n\nPutting this together, his age and arrest history suggest high recidivism risk. The lack of education is another significant factor. Substance use (marijuana) adds to that risk. His living situation alone is a major concern because being alone can lead to issues like substance abuse or isolation. Even though he's from a small household, the overall context might still be a risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards yes because his age and arrest history are strong indicators of potential recidivism. However, the lack of education and living situation could also contribute. But I think the arrest history is the most critical factor here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"high risk due to arrest history\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"high recidivism rate\"),\n    (\"no education\", \"low\", \"lower educational background increases risk\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"limiting access to support systems and resources\"),\n    (\"substance use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"additive risk factor for relapse\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
