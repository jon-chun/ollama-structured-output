These include having stable housing with a spouse, having held steady employment, not currently feeling depressed, and coming from a stable family background. The self-reported belief in a higher power may also indicate a sense of personal responsibility and accountability. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should be used as one tool among many in a comprehensive risk assessment process.",
