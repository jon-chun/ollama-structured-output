Factors such as age, gender, race, and past drug use do not necessarily indicate a high risk. The fact that she has held multiple jobs in the past year and has a high school diploma suggest stability. Additionally, her statement about believing in God may indicate a support system and a sense of purpose. However, it is important to note that a more comprehensive assessment would be necessary to accurately determine risk level.",
