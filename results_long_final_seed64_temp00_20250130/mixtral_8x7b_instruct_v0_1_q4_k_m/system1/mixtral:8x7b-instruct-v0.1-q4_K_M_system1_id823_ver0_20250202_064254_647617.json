These include past drug use, mental health concerns (feeling \"down in the dumps\" and potentially experiencing symptoms of depression), and unstable living conditions during childhood. The fact that she has held only one job during the year may also indicate difficulty maintaining employment or financial instability, both of which can contribute to increased risk. However, her marriage and high school education suggest some level of stability and support in her life, which slightly lowers the overall risk assessment.",
