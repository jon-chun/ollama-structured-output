The lack of employment, stable living arrangements, and educational or vocational engagement also contribute to the risk assessment. While no signs of depression were reported, the person's upbringing in a non-traditional household and rejection of religious beliefs may indicate additional challenges. However, it is essential to consider that this assessment does not account for potential interventions, support systems, or individual circumstances that could mitigate these risk factors.",
