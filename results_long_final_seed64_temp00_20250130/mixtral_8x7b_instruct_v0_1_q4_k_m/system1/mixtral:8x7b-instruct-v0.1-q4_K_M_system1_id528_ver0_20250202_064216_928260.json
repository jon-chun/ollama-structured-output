The individual's history of arrests and convictions, along with his marijuana use in the past four years, indicate a higher risk. His limited social connections (not married, living alone) and lack of educational or vocational engagement also contribute to this assessment. However, the absence of depression and a stable living situation at a young age somewhat mitigate these factors. Overall, I would rate the confidence level at 72%, indicating a moderately high risk.",
