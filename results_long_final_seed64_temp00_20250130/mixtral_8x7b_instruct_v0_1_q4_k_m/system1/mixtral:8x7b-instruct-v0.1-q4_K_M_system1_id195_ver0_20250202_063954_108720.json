They have held a job, completed high school, and are married, all of which can indicate stability. Their past drug use and urban upbringing could be potential risk factors, but without more context or additional risks, I cannot classify them as high risk with confidence. However, it is important to note that a comprehensive risk assessment should consider many other factors, including the nature and circumstances of their past arrests and convictions.",
