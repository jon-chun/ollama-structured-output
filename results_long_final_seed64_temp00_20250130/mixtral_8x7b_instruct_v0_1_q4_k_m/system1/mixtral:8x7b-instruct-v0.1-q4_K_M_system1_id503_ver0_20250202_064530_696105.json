Additionally, the individual's belief in a higher power may indicate a greater sense of personal responsibility and accountability. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole determinant of risk. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to accurately assess and manage risk.",
