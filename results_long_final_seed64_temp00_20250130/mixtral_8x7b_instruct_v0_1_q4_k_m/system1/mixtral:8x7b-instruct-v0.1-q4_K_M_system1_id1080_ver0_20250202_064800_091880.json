Factors such as their age, education level, employment history, and lack of recent depression are generally associated with lower risk levels. However, it's important to note that having a criminal record and past drug use do increase their risk level somewhat. Additionally, while living in an urban area and having grown up in a large household can sometimes be linked to higher risk, these factors alone are not enough to make a definitive assessment. Overall, more information and context would be needed to make a more accurate prediction.",
