Prior arrests and convictions indicate a potential pattern of criminal behavior.\n2. Lack of stable employment and education can increase the likelihood of criminal involvement.\n3. Substance use, specifically marijuana, is a risk factor for criminal behavior.\n4. Mental health issues (feeling down and depressed) can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior.\n5. While living with both parents in a two-parent household can be protective, this individual grew up in a single-mother household of five, which could potentially increase the risk if other factors are present.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that these factors do not guarantee future criminal behavior and should be considered within the context of a comprehensive assessment.",
