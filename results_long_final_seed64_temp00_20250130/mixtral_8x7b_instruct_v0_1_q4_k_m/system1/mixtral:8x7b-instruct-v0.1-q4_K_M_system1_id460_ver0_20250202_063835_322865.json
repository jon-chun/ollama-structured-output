For example, they have not been convicted of any crimes, live with someone else (which can provide social support), and report no recent feelings of depression. Additionally, their employment history suggests some stability. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should be considered as a preliminary estimate only. A comprehensive risk assessment would require more detailed and extensive information about the individual's background, behaviors, and circumstances.",
