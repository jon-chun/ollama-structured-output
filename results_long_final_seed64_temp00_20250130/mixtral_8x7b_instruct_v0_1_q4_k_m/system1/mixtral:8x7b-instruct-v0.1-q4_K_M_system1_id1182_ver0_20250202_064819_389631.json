However, based on the information provided, it does not seem like this person has any major red flags that would indicate a high risk. They have a stable living situation, some employment history, and no recent signs of depression. Their past drug use and young age may be cause for some concern, but without more context or additional risk factors, I would rate their risk as moderate to low.",
