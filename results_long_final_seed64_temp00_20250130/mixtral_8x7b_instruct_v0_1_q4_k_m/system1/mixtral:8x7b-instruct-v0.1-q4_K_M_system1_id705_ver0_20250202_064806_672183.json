Additionally, having a stable living situation, a high school education, and a history of employment also indicate lower risk. The fact that he believes in a higher power may suggest a stronger support system which can contribute to reduced recidivism. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole determinant of risk. Ongoing monitoring and assessment is necessary for accurate risk management.",
