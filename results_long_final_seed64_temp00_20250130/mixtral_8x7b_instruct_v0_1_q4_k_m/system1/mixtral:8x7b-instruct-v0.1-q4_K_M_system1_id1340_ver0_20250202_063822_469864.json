The lack of conviction after arrest and the absence of recent criminal behavior also indicate a lower risk. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole determinant of risk level. A comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for an accurate assessment.",
