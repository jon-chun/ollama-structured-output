Her current living situation (living alone) also indicates stability and independence, which are positive indicators for risk assessment. However, her past drug use and feelings of despair indicate potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism. The lack of a criminal record and her current living situation also suggest that she has not been involved in any high-risk activities or interactions with law enforcement. Therefore, while there are some risk factors to consider, they do not indicate a high level of risk for this individual.",
