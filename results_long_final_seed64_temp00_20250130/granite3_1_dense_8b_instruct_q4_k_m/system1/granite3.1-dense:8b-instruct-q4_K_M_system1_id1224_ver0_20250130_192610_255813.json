While the individual has a history of arrests and convictions, he is young (18 years old), which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates. He is currently enrolled in school and living alone, suggesting some level of stability. His lack of drug use and employment during the past year are positive indicators. The absence of a history of spousal abuse or violence is also noteworthy. However, his self-reported feelings of depression could potentially indicate an increased risk for future offenses if left unaddressed. Overall, given the available information, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
