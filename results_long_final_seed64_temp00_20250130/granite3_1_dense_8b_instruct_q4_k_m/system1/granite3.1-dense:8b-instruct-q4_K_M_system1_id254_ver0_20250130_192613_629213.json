    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (18) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other demographic groups. Secondly, her criminal history is limited to 4 arrests and 3 convictions, which is not extensive. Thirdly, she has never been married and is currently enrolled in school, both of which are associated with lower recidivism rates. Fourthly, she has held a job for the entire year, indicating some level of stability. Lastly, she has not used drugs or experienced depression in the past month or year, respectively, which reduces her risk for substance abuse and mental health-related offenses.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that living with a household size of 5 during childhood could potentially indicate exposure to more complex family dynamics, which might increase risk. Her belief that God has nothing to do with personal events does not directly impact recidivism risk but could be indicative of a lack of religious or spiritual support, which some studies suggest may have a protective effect against criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risk factors present, the combination of her limited criminal history, current educational and employment status, and absence of substance abuse or mental health issues suggests a relatively low risk for reoffending.",
