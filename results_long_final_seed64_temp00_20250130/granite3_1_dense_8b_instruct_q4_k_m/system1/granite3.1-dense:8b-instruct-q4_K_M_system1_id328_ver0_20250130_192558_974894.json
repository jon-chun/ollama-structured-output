The individual's age (22), gender, and ethnicity are not typically associated with high criminal recidivism rates. She has only been arrested once without conviction, suggesting minimal involvement in criminal activity. Her physical attributes and living situation do not present any significant risk factors. She has a stable employment history, no history of drug use, and is not currently married or in a relationship, which can sometimes be associated with increased risk. However, her recent feelings of depression could potentially indicate a need for mental health support. Her upbringing in an urban area with her biological mother and siblings does not suggest a history of familial or environmental factors that typically contribute to criminal behavior. Lastly, her religious beliefs do not indicate any propensity towards criminal activity. Despite the depression factor, the overall picture suggests a low risk due to the absence of other high-risk indicators.",
