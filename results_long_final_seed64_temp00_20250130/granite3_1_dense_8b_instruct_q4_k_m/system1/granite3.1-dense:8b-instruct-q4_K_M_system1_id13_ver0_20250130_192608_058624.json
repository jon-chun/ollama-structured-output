The individual's age (20), gender, and ethnicity do not inherently suggest high risk. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which is not extensive. He has no significant employment history, but this does not necessarily indicate a propensity for crime. His drug use, while present, is limited to marijuana and does not suggest a pattern of substance abuse that could lead to criminal behavior. His mental health, as indicated by feelings of sadness, do not meet the criteria for clinical depression or other serious mental health conditions. His upbringing in an urban area with both biological parents and siblings suggests a stable family environment. His religious beliefs (or lack thereof) do not indicate a propensity for criminal behavior. However, the absence of employment and occasional feelings of sadness are factors that could potentially increase risk if present in combination with other high-risk factors. Given these considerations, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
