    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. The individual's age (22) and gender (male) are not typically associated with high recidivism rates. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and one conviction, which suggests a lower risk compared to individuals with multiple offenses. His marital status and current living situation with his spouse also indicate stability. The fact that he has held two jobs during the year suggests employment stability. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, but this factor alone does not significantly increase risk. His drug use history is positive, as he has not used any drugs in the past four years. However, he occasionally experiences feelings of depression, which could potentially indicate a need for mental health support. Living in a large household at a young age and his religious beliefs do not significantly contribute to risk factors. Overall, while some aspects of this individual's background may warrant monitoring or intervention (such as his occasional depressive episodes), the combination of these factors does not suggest a high risk for reoffending.",
