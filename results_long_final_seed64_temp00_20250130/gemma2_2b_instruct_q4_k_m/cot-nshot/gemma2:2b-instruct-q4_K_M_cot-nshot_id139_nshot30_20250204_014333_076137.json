The individual's history of drug use indicates a potential for future criminal activity.\n\n**Confidence:**  The model assigns a high confidence score (80%) based on the combination of these factors, suggesting that the individual has a higher likelihood of re-arrest in three years. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be considered definitive. \n* Recidivism prediction models are complex and require careful consideration of multiple factors. \n* The model's accuracy can vary depending on the quality of data used to train it.  \n\n\n\n",
