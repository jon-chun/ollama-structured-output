Lack of education and employment also contribute to a higher likelihood of re-offending.\n* **Medium Risk Factors:** Age is considered medium as it's not a direct predictor but can be factored into the overall picture. \n* **Low Risk Factors:** Race/ethnicity, living situation, and religious beliefs are considered low risk factors because they don't have a strong correlation with recidivism.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be taken as definitive. \n* Recidivism prediction is complex and involves many factors beyond those listed here. \n* A higher confidence score does not necessarily mean the prediction is accurate, but it reflects a stronger likelihood of recidivism.  \n\n\n",
