However, this is not necessarily indicative of future criminal activity.\n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):** Religious beliefs are not directly linked to recidivism.\n\n\n**Confidence:** The confidence level is 75% based on the combination of these factors and their relative weight.  \n\n**Important Notes:** This analysis is a simplified representation of a complex issue. It's crucial to remember that:\n\n* **Context Matters:** Individual circumstances, social support networks, and other personal factors play a significant role in predicting recidivism.\n* **No Single Factor Is Definitive:** These risk factors are not absolute predictors; their combined effect determines the overall likelihood of re-arrest. \n* **Ethical Considerations:**  It's essential to use these assessments responsibly and ethically, avoiding bias and discrimination. \n\n\n",
