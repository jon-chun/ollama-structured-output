A confidence level of 75% reflects a moderate degree of certainty in the prediction.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. \n* Recidivism risk assessment requires a comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors, including individual circumstances, social support networks, and access to resources. \n* It's crucial to remember that individuals are complex, and their behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the scope of this analysis.  \n",
