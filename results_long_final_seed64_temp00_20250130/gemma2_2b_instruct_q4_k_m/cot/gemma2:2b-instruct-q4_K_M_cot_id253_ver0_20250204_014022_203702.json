This is a strong indicator of future risk.\n* **Education Level (Low):** Lack of education can limit employment opportunities and increase vulnerability to negative influences. \n* **Employment Status (Low):**  Lack of employment suggests limited resources and potential for instability.\n* **Substance Use (Low):** Marijuana use, while a concern, is not considered a strong predictor on its own in this context.\n* **Living Situation (Low):** Living situation alone or with family can be a mitigating factor. \n* **Family Structure (Low):**  The lack of a stable family structure may contribute to instability and risk-taking behavior.\n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):** This is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used for definitive legal decisions. \n* Recidivism prediction models are complex, and this assessment provides a starting point for further investigation.  \n* A comprehensive risk assessment would involve additional factors like mental health history, criminal history details, and social support networks. \n\n\n",

He has been arrested 5 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
