A high confidence score reflects the strong influence of the low-risk factors. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment. \n* It's crucial to consider individual circumstances, cultural context, and other relevant data points when making decisions about criminal justice interventions. \n* The use of race in risk assessment is highly controversial and often biased.  It's important to avoid using race as a predictor of future behavior. \n\n\n",
