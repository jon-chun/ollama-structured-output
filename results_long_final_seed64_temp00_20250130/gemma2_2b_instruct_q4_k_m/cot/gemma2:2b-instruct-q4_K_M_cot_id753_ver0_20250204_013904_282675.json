The factors are weighted based on their known association with recidivism.  \n\n* **High Risk Factors:** Age, Substance Use, Mental Health, Living Situation\n* **Medium Risk Factors:** Prior Convictions, Education Level, Family Structure \n* **Low Risk Factors:** Employment History, Religious Beliefs\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This is a simplified assessment based on limited information. A comprehensive risk assessment would involve more detailed data and potentially utilize predictive models.\n* The \"confidence\" score reflects the strength of the prediction based on the provided factors. It's important to remember that even with high confidence, there is always an element of uncertainty in predicting recidivism. \n\n\n",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 230 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
