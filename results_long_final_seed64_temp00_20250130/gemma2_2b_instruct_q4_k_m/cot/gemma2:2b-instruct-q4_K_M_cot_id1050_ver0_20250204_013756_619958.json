The factors are weighted based on their known impact on recidivism rates. \n\n* **Age (high):**  Young adults have higher re-offending rates than older individuals.\n* **Prior Convictions (medium):** Two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior but not necessarily a high risk.\n* **Drug Use (high):** Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, especially in combination with other factors. \n* **Mental Health (medium):** Depression and low mood could be indicators of underlying mental health issues that may contribute to future criminal behavior. However, this factor's weight is moderate as it's not a direct cause of re-offending.\n* **Socioeconomic Status (high):** Lack of education and employment stability can increase the likelihood of recidivism. The individual's limited educational attainment and unstable job history suggest a higher risk. \n* **Family Structure (low):** A stable family environment may have mitigated future criminal behavior, but this is not a strong predictor on its own.\n* **Religious Beliefs (low):** Religious beliefs are not considered a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" because the individual's profile suggests a high risk of rearrest within three years. The confidence level is 75% based on the combined weight of these factors.  \n\nIt's important to note that this assessment is just one factor in a comprehensive risk assessment process. It should be used in conjunction with other information and professional judgment. \n",
