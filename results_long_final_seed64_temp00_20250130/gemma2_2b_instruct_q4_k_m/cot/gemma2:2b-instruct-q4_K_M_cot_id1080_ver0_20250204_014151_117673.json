However, it's still a factor to consider.\n* **Living Situation (Low):** Living alone could indicate social isolation or lack of support systems, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending. \n* **Family Structure (High):**  Growing up in a large family with a mother may have provided some stability and support, but it's not a strong predictor on its own.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used for definitive predictions. \n* The weight assigned to each factor is subjective and can vary depending on the specific risk assessment model being used. \n* A high confidence score (85%) indicates a strong likelihood of recidivism, but it's crucial to remember that this is just an estimate based on available data.  \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide legal or professional advice. This analysis should not be considered a substitute for the expertise of qualified professionals in criminal justice risk assessment. \n",
