A young female with no prior convictions is less likely to re-offend.\n* **Education Level, Employment Status:** These factors suggest a lower likelihood of recidivism.  A college student suggests potential for future stability and positive life choices. \n* **Substance Use History:** This factor is considered medium risk as it indicates past drug use. However, the lack of depression in the last month could mitigate this.\n* **Living Situation:** Living alone may be a low-risk factor, but it's important to consider the context of her living situation and any potential support systems she has access to. \n* **Family Structure:**  Her upbringing with her mother suggests a potentially supportive environment. However, the lack of strong family ties could also contribute to risk.\n* **Religious Beliefs:** This factor is considered low risk as it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This assessment is based on limited information and should not be used for legal or personal decisions. \n* Recidivism prediction models are complex, and individual circumstances can significantly influence outcomes.  \n* A high confidence score (85%) indicates a strong likelihood of recidivism but does not guarantee it. \n\n\n",
