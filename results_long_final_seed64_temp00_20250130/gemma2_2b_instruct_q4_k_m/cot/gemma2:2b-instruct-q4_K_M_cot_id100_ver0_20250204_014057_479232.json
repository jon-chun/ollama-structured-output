The confidence level reflects the strength of the evidence and the potential for bias. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based on general trends and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting individual risk. It's crucial to consider each case individually, taking into account specific circumstances and mitigating factors. \n",
