The confidence score reflects the strength of the predictive model based on these factors. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive assessment tool. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires more detailed data, including individual circumstances, psychological evaluations, and other relevant factors. \n* The interpretation of this analysis should always be done in conjunction with professional judgment and ethical considerations. \n",

He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
