Individual circumstances are crucial for accurate assessment.\n* **Confidence Level:** The confidence level reflects the strength of the prediction based on the provided information. \n\n\nIt's important to remember that this is a simplified risk assessment and should not be used as a definitive tool for decision-making.  A comprehensive evaluation requires a more nuanced approach considering individual circumstances, specific offense details, and other relevant factors. \n",
