A 75% confidence level reflects the complexity of risk assessment and the need for nuanced interpretation. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires more detailed data, including individual circumstances, psychological evaluations, and social history. \n* The use of this model should always be accompanied by ethical considerations and legal safeguards to ensure fairness and avoid bias. \n",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse.
