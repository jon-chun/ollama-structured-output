A higher score indicates greater certainty in the prediction.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment. \n* Recidivism is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including individual circumstances, social support systems, and access to resources. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires a more nuanced approach that considers individual case details and utilizes multiple data points.  \n",
