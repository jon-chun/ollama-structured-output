It's important to note that this is a simplified model, and real-world recidivism prediction is complex. \n\n* **Prior Arrests (High):** The individual has a significant history of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\n* **Age (High):** Young age can be associated with impulsivity and lack of life experience, potentially increasing the risk of future offenses.\n* **Substance Use (Medium):** While drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, its severity and frequency are crucial to consider. \n* **Living Situation (Low):** Living alone may indicate social isolation or difficulty maintaining stable relationships, which could increase the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nThe model predicts a high probability of rearrest due to the combination of these factors.  It's important to remember that this is just one possible interpretation and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. \n",
