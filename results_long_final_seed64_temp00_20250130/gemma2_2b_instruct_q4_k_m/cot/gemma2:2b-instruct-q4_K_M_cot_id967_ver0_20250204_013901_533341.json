A high confidence score reflects a strong likelihood of the individual's future behavior. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used for legal or decision-making purposes. \n* Recidivism risk assessment is complex, and many other factors can influence an individual's behavior.  \n* A comprehensive assessment requires a more nuanced approach that considers the individual's specific circumstances and history. \n",
