A high confidence score reflects a strong likelihood of the individual re-offending. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is highly simplified and should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment. \n* Recidivism is complex, influenced by numerous factors beyond those listed here. \n* It's crucial to consider each case individually and avoid generalizations based on race or other demographic factors.  \n",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
