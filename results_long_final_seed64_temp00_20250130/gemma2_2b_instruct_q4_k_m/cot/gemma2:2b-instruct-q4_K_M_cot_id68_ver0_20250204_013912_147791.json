The individual's specific circumstances and the nature of their prior conviction are crucial for a more accurate prediction.\n* **Risk Assessment is Complex:**  A single score cannot fully capture an individual's risk. It should be used in conjunction with other factors, including: \n    * **Offense Type:** The severity and type of crime committed can significantly impact recidivism risk.\n    * **Support Systems:** Access to social support networks, employment opportunities, and mental health services are crucial for reducing re-offending.\n    * **Probation/Rehabilitation Programs:** Participation in these programs can be a powerful tool for reducing recidivism. \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional risk assessment or legal advice.  \n",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.
