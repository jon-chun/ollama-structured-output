However, one job in a year is not necessarily indicative of instability. \n* **Substance Use (Low):**  The individual has no history of drug use, which is generally associated with higher risk.\n* **Mental Health (Low):** The individual reports no depression and has been free from substance abuse for four years. This suggests good mental health.\n* **Family Structure (Medium):** Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, but the presence of both parents in childhood could be considered a positive factor. \n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):**  This factor is not directly linked to recidivism risk.\n\n**Confidence:** The prediction is based on a combination of these factors and their relative weights. A high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence for the prediction. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism.\n* Recidivism risk assessment is complex and requires consideration of many other factors, including individual circumstances, specific offense history, and social support networks. \n* It's crucial to remember that this is just one possible interpretation based on the provided information.  A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data and a deeper understanding of the individual's unique situation. \n",
