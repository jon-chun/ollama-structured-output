His physical attributes are typical for his age group.\n- **History of Arrests and Convictions**: Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a history of criminal activity, which indicates high risk due to repeat offenses and potential reoffending.\n- **Living Alone and School Enrollment**: Living alone and attending school at the present time indicate independence but also increases vulnerability to social isolation and potential neglect.\n- **Drug Use**: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some recent months, indicating substance abuse. This is a high-risk factor for addiction and mental health issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with his biological mother suggests a lack of support systems, which can exacerbate stress and increase risk of substance use or other behavioral problems.\n- **Current Situation**: Being enrolled in school at the present time indicates stability but also implies potential challenges related to academic performance, peer relationships, and mental health.\n\nAll these factors collectively indicate high risk due to his history of criminal activity, substance abuse, and potential for reoffending. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 85%.",
