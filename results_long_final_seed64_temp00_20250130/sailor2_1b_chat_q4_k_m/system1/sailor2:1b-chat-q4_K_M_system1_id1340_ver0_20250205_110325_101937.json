These factors are generally low-risk indicators.\n- **Occupation and Income**: He works part-time, which might indicate a stable income but does not provide immediate high risk.\n- **Marital Status and Social Dynamics**: No significant marital status or social dynamics suggest instability.\n- **Education and Employment**: His lack of formal education and employment suggests potential for low-level work, potentially less risky compared to those with higher levels of education.\n- **Drug Use**: He has never used drugs in the past four years, indicating a stable drug-free lifestyle. However, this is not a high-risk indicator unless he's using substances frequently or in significant quantities.\n- **Health Status and Mental Health**: The lack of depression over the past month suggests good mental health but does not indicate immediate high risk due to his age and general well-being.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with size 11 household implies stability, which is a low-risk factor.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction indicates \"NO\" (high risk) based on the provided information.",
