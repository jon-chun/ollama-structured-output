His physical attributes are typical of a young man in his demographic.\n- **History of Arrests and Convictions**: He has been arrested multiple times, indicating potential criminal activity, but no recent convictions or recidivism history suggests high risk.\n- **Occupation and Income**: The job he holds (a part-time position) is within the legal limits for a 18-year-old male. His income does not suggest financial instability.\n- **Drug Use**: He has used drugs in the past four years, which is consistent with his age group but does not indicate severe dependency or addiction.\n- **Family Background and Personal Life**: The lack of a high school diploma, GED certificate, and college enrollment suggests he may be at risk for educational gaps. However, his current employment status indicates stability.\n- **Psychological Factors**: His recent history of depression (four months ago) is not indicative of severe mental health issues but rather an indication of stress or adjustment to life changes.\n- **Age and Social Status**: He lives in a household size 3, which is typical for young adults. The lack of social isolation suggests he has strong support systems.\n\nGiven these factors, the risk assessment indicates high probability of potential high-risk behavior based on his age, physical characteristics, criminal history, employment status, drug use patterns, and family background. Therefore, **\"YES\"** is the correct prediction with a confidence level of 95%.",
