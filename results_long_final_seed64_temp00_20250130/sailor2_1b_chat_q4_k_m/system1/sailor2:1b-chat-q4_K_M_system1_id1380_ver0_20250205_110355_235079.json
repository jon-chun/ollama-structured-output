However, the lack of education and employment status suggests underlying challenges.\n- **Current Situation**: Living alone, no jobs, drug use, and a history of substance abuse highlight potential risks related to substance dependence, mental health issues, and financial instability.\n- **Family Background**: The presence of both biological parents in a rural area with limited resources indicates a high risk of dependency or neglect.\n- **Age and Social Status**: Being young (18 years old) and living alone suggests a lack of social support networks, which can exacerbate stressors.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is that this person has a high risk due to their criminal history, substance abuse, physical limitations, and potential for severe consequences if not managed properly. Therefore, **YES**.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
