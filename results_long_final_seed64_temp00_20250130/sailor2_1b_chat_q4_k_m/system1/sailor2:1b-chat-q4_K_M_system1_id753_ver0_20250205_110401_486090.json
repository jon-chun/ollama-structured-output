These factors suggest potential physical vulnerability.\n- **History of Arrests and Convictions**: Two arrests and one conviction indicate criminal activity history, which can be significant indicators of high risk.\n- **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Single status and living alone further increases the likelihood of isolation and social isolation, contributing to increased stress and depression.\n- **Drug Use**: Current drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and a recent feeling of despair indicate substance abuse and potential mental health issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with biological parents who are not enrolled in college or have no high school diploma indicates limited education, which is often associated with higher risk behaviors.\n- **Current Situation**: Feeling down due to drug use and lack of support (living alone) suggests a complex emotional state that could be exacerbated by current circumstances.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is \"YES\" indicating high risk.",
