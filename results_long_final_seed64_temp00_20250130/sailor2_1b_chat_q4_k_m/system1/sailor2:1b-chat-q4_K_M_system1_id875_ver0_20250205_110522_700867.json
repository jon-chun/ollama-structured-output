His age, physical attributes, and background suggest he might be at risk for various crimes or issues.\n- **Marital Status**: Single status indicates potential instability in his personal life.\n- **Employment History**: Two jobs during the year, indicating job insecurity and possible unemployment.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years of drug use (marijuana) suggests substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living alone with biological parents implies a lack of support systems, potentially increasing vulnerability.\n- **Risk Factors for Depression**: The past month's feeling of depression indicates potential mental health issues that could be exacerbated by stressors.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction aligns well with high risk. Therefore, the confidence is 85%.",
