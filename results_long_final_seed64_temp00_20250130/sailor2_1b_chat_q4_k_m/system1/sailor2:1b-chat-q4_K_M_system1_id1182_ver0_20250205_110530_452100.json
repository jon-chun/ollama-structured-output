These characteristics suggest potential risk.\n- **Historical Arrests and Convictions**: Multiple arrests and convictions indicate criminal activity, which can be indicative of high-risk behaviors.\n- **Physical Characteristics**: Being 5'7\" tall, weighing 142 lbs, and living alone highlight physical vulnerability and financial instability.\n- **Marital Status**: Single status indicates a lack of support systems, potentially increasing stressors.\n- **Employment History**: Two jobs in the past year suggests temporary employment and potential instability. The absence of college education further complicates his career prospects.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years of drug use (marijuana) and current depression suggest substance abuse issues that could be life-threatening or disruptive.\n- **Family Background**: Living with a biological mother in an urban area, coupled with the high cost of living, suggests financial instability and potential for exploitation.\n\nAll these factors collectively indicate a high risk profile. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction based on the given information.",
