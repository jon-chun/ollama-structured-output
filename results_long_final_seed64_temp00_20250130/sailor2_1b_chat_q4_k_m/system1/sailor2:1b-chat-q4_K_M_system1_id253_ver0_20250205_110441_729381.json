This indicates limited education and social support.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years with marijuana use, indicating substance abuse.\n- **Psychological Status**: Negative mood over the past month (depression), consistent with mental health issues.\n- **Family Environment**: Living in a household of size 5 in an urban area, suggesting potential stressors and isolation.\n\nGiven these factors, high risk is indicated by the presence of multiple indicators indicating substance abuse, criminal history, and potentially severe psychological distress. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80%.",
