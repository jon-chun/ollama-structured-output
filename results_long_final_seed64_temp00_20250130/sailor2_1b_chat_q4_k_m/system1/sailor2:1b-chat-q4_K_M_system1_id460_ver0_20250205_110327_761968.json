These factors suggest high physical activity and potential health risks.\n- **Background Information**: His past criminal record, lack of education, and drug use indicate significant risk factors for substance abuse and mental health issues.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with his biological mother in an urban area suggests social isolation and a higher likelihood of experiencing stressors.\n- **Current Situation**: The absence of a stable relationship (single) and the current living situation suggest potential instability or dependency, which are high-risk indicators.\n- **Past Behavior**: Drug use over four years and lack of depression indicate substance abuse patterns. His age at the time of drug use suggests early onset of addiction.\n- **Age and Social Status**: Being young and in a household size 6 (urban) indicates higher vulnerability to social isolation, economic instability, and potential exploitation.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest high risk due to their combination of physical health issues, substance abuse, mental health risks, and potential for dependency. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.",
