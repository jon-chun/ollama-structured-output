Her physical size, weight, and age are indicators of potential exploitation.\n- **Background and History**: Arrested for drug use, convicted, and living alone, which suggest substance abuse and lack of stability. This history indicates a higher likelihood of addiction-related issues.\n- **Education and Employment**: No high school diploma or GED certificate, no college enrollment, and limited employment (3 jobs in the past year), indicating low educational attainment and potential for job insecurity.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years and recent month feel down, suggesting substance abuse and mental health challenges. This pattern suggests a history of substance use disorder.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with her biological mother, which is a significant risk factor due to family instability and lack of support systems.\n\nAll these factors collectively indicate high risk due to the combination of vulnerability, substance abuse, lack of stability, and potential for addiction-related issues. Therefore, \"YES\" and a confidence level of 85% are appropriate.",
