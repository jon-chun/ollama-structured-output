Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
