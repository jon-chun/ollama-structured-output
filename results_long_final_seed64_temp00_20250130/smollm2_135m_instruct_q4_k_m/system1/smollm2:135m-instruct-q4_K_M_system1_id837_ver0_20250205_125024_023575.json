He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.\n\n2. **Confidence**: The person's confidence level is between 0% and 1%. This means that there are no extreme risks or low-risk factors associated with this individual, such as being arrested multiple times, having a high school diploma or GED certificate, owning a gun, etc.\n3. **Probability of occurrence**: There are two possible outcomes: \"Yes\" (prediction) and \"No\". This means that there is only one risk factor associated with the person's actions.\n4. **Risk Factors to Analyze**: The person has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted, which suggests a high-risk scenario for this individual. He also uses drugs in the past four years (marijuana), and he has had multiple job experiences during his lifetime. Additionally, he is currently living alone with a family of size 5, who are not enrolled in college.\n5. **Risk Factors to Avoid**: There are no extreme risks or low-risk factors associated with this individual's actions. This means that there are no high-risk scenarios for the person and his actions.",
