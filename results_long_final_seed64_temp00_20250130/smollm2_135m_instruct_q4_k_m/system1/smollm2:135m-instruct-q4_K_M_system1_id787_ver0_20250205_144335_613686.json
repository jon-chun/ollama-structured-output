This indicates that there is a high likelihood of someone being involved in an act of violence or harm to themselves or others within the next few days.\n\n2. Confidence: Between 0 and 100% (number between 0 and 5), indicating that you have a good understanding of your data, but not enough information to make any definitive conclusions about the likelihood of someone being involved in an act of violence or harm.\n\nBased on your analysis, I will conclude that there is a high risk factor: Prediction: YES (probability = 0.6). This suggests that you have a strong inclination towards engaging in violent behavior and are more likely to be involved in acts of violence if you continue to observe the situation closely.",
