She is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n2. **Confidence**: The person's confidence level (number between 0 and 1) indicates their overall likelihood of being involved in the crime scenario described above, based on their past behavior and actions. A higher confidence level suggests a stronger likelihood of involvement.\n3. **Probability**: The probability score ranges from 0 to 99 for each risk factor. This allows us to calculate the probability that the person is involved in the crime scenario given their specific characteristics. For example, if the person has never been married and is currently not living alone, there are a total of 12 possible outcomes (probability = 3/4). If they have used drugs in the past four years, there are 90 possible outcomes (probability = 5/6), and so on.\n4. **Probability**: The probability score ranges from 0 to 1 for each risk factor.
