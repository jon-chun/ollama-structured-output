This suggests that he may be at high risk for committing crimes based on his past behavior.\n\n2. **Confidence**: The person's prediction indicates that he is likely to commit crimes if he continues to act impulsively, without considering the consequences of his actions. This could include using drugs and living alone in an urban area with a limited budget.\n\n3. **Probability**: The probability of committing crimes based on his past behavior suggests that he may be at high risk for crime due to his history of acting impulsively and not considering the potential consequences of his actions.\n\nOverall, these factors indicate that the person is likely to commit crimes if he continues to act impulsively and without considering the consequences of his actions.",
