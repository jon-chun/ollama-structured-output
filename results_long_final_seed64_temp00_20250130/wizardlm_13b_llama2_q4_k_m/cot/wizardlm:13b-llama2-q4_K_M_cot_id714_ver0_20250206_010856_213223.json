She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
