He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 151 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
