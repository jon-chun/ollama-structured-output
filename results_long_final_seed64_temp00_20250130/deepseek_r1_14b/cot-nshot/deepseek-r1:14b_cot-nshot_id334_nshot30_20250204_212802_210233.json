    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18-19 year olds sometimes had recidivism outcomes, but age alone isn't a strong indicator unless combined with others.\n\nHe's White. In the examples, race didn't seem to be a significant factor on its own for recidivism. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. This is a strong indicator because prior convictions are often linked to higher recidivism rates. From the examples, having been arrested multiple times usually led to a 'YES' outcome. So high weight here.\n\nCurrently living alone. In some cases, living with others seemed protective, so living alone might be a risk factor. Medium weight.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education can be protective, but without further info on employment or education impact, I'll give it low.\n\nHeld 3 jobs during the year. Employment is generally seen as positive, reducing recidivism chances. So medium.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Drug use correlates with higher recidivism, especially if it's ongoing. High weight here.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no symptoms is a positive sign. Low.\n\nLived in an urban area with 5 siblings at a young age. Urban environments and larger family size might indicate more challenges but not directly predictive. Medium.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. In examples, spirituality sometimes had mixed effects, but generally didn't strongly influence recidivism. So low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: prior arrests/convictions (high), drug use (high) are strong positives for rearrest. Employment and no depression are negatives. Other factors like living alone and urban background add some risk but aren't as significant.\n\nI think the high-weighted factors will lead to a 'YES' prediction. Confidence is around 75% because while the major factors point towards recidivism, there are protective elements too.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; no strong correlation in examples\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race not a significant factor in examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested twice and convicted once; prior arrests are strong indicators of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone; living alone may indicate fewer social supports\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma; education is generally protective but not definitive here\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs during the year; employment can be a protective factor but not conclusive\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years; recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month; no reported mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area; family dynamics and environment may contribute to risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Considers God influential; spirituality's impact on recidivism is unclear but generally not strong\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
