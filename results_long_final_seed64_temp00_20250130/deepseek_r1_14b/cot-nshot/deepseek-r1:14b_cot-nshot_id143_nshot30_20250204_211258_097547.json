    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 22-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18-19 year olds had mixed outcomes, but older ones (like 20s) might have different patterns. Not sure yet, so I'll note it as a possible medium factor.\n\nShe's White. In the examples, race didn't seem to be a determining factor; outcomes varied regardless of race. So maybe this is low impact.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, even one arrest sometimes led to rearrests, especially if other factors are present. This seems like a medium risk because an arrest indicates potential for future issues.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll skip that.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. In examples, living alone didn't consistently correlate with rearrest. Maybe low impact here.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't enrolled now. Higher education is usually protective against crime, so this might be a mitigating factor\u2014low risk.\n\nShe held four jobs in the year. Employment stability can reduce recidivism, so this is another low-risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates, especially if it's ongoing. This seems like a medium to high risk factor because substance abuse can lead to further criminal behavior.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of rearrest, so this is another medium factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability might be protective, but living in an urban area could mean more exposure to crime. This seems like a low-medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her situation. Spirituality can sometimes help with rehabilitation, so the lack of it might slightly increase risk\u2014low impact.\n\nNow, weighing these: drug use and mental health are significant (medium-high). The arrest history is medium. Positive factors like education and employment are present but might not outweigh the negatives. \n\nLooking at examples where similar factors were present, especially drug use and mental health, rearrest was more likely. So I think the prediction would be \"YES\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; previous examples show mixed outcomes but older age may have higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race was not a significant factor in previous examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; indicates potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Completed Bachelor's degree; higher education is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 4 jobs; stable employment reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years; substance abuse correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Felt down in the dumps some times; mental health issues can increase rearrest risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in urban area; mixed impact but possibly protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Doesn't believe God influences her situation; may slightly increase risk\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone; no significant correlation in examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
