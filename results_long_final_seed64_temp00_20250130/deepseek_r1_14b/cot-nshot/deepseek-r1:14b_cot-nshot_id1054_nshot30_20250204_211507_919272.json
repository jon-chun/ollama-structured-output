    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, a single arrest without conviction seems to be a low risk factor because in some cases like Example 29, someone with an arrest didn't rearrest. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, his weight is between 150-174 lbs. In previous examples, weight wasn't a significant factor unless it was extremely high or low. Since this is within average range, I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's not married and currently not living alone. Unmarried status can be a risk, but not living alone might mean he has support, so maybe medium? Wait, in the examples, being single didn't always lead to rearrest, so perhaps it's low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but holding only one job might not be strong enough. Maybe medium? Or perhaps it's still considered positive, so low.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014this is definitely a protective factor. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe felt down some times recently. Emotional issues can be a risk if they lead to substance abuse or crime. This seems more significant, maybe medium.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of 3 in an urban area. Family support can be protective, but living in an urban area might have its own risks. I'm leaning towards low because the family presence is positive, but the environment could be neutral to slightly negative.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Spirituality can sometimes help with behavior, so lack of it might increase risk. This seems like a medium factor.\n\nNow, considering all factors: most are low except for emotional state and spirituality. These two might tip the balance towards higher risk. Looking at examples where similar factors led to rearrest, I think this case would result in YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction is a low risk factor\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Normal weight range does not indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide support, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is protective\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job shows some stability but could be limited\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk\"),\n    (\"Mental health state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can indicate potential issues\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Living with parents may provide support\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God might increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
