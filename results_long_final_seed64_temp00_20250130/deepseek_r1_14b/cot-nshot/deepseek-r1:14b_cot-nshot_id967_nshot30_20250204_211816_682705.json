    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, even a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to recidivism (like Example 27), so this might be a medium risk here.\n\nNext, his drug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. In previous cases, drug use was often linked to higher recidivism rates, especially when combined with other factors. This seems like a high-weight factor.\n\nHe's living alone now, which can be a double-edged sword. While independence is good, lack of support might increase risk. But in examples, this wasn't the strongest factor, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education generally reduces recidivism, but not being enrolled could mean he's not seeking further education, which might be a slight concern\u2014probably low weight here.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment is usually protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong positive factor, maybe high weight to reduce risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he's not showing signs now, it might have a low impact here.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with household size 4. Family stability is generally protective, so this should be a high-weight factor reducing risk.\n\nLastly, he believes God influences his life. In examples, spirituality sometimes helped reduce recidivism, so this could be a medium positive factor.\n\nNow, balancing these factors: drug use and past arrest are negatives, while employment, family background, and spirituality are positives. The strongest negative is the drug use, which often leads to higher recidivism rates. However, his stable upbringing and current job might mitigate that risk somewhat. \n\nLooking at similar examples where drug use was present but other factors were positive, like Example 29 (YES) and Example 17 (NO), it's a bit mixed. But considering the arrest history and ongoing drug use, I'm leaning towards higher risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction can be a moderate indicator of potential recidivism, as seen in examples where similar cases sometimes led to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk, especially when combined with other factors like past arrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited support systems, which could moderately increase the risk of rearrest compared to those with family support.\"),\n    (\"Education Status\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college is generally neutral but slightly concerning as it may limit future opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs suggests stability and responsibility, which can significantly reduce recidivism risk, outweighing other negative factors to some extent.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month is a positive factor, though not as impactful as employment or drug use.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable rural household is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God influences life can provide personal motivation to avoid crime, acting as a moderate protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
