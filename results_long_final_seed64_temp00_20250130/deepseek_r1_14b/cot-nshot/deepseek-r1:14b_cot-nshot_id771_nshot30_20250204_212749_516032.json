    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Looking at previous examples, younger ages like 18-20 often had higher recidivism rates, but since he's in his early twenties, it might not be a significant factor here unless combined with others.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. In the examples provided, race didn't seem to directly influence the outcome, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nArrested 3 times and convicted once. This is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. Previous arrests are a high risk factor because they show a history of engaging with the criminal justice system.\n\nConvicted once adds to that, but since he's already been arrested multiple times, I think it's part of the same category. So maybe medium here, but considering the arrest count is higher, perhaps high.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so low impact.\n\nNever married. In some cases, marital status can be a factor, but in this dataset, it didn't show a strong correlation. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nCurrently not living alone. This might indicate instability or lack of support systems, which could contribute to higher risk. Looking at examples where the person wasn't living alone, recidivism was sometimes higher, so medium here.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor, but without further education, it's mixed. In some cases, having a diploma helps, but if he's not employed or has other issues, it might not be enough. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year. Employment is generally a positive factor, but holding only one job might indicate instability or that he's underemployed. In examples where employment was steady, recidivism was lower, so maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and not feeling depressed. Both are positive factors; substance abuse and mental health issues can increase risk, so the absence of these is protective. So low impact for both.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 2 as a child. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info on family environment, it's hard to assess. In examples, this didn't seem to have a direct effect, so I'll rate it low.\n\nConsiders God has nothing to do with his life events. Spiritual beliefs can affect behavior and support systems. If he doesn't see spirituality as relevant, it might reduce protective factors. So medium impact here.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: multiple arrests and convictions are high risk. Employment is mixed but not strong positive. Living situation and spiritual views are medium risks. Other factors like education and family background are low. \n\nLooking at the examples, someone with 3 arrests and a conviction often had higher recidivism rates. For instance, Example 27 had similar stats but was NO, while others with fewer arrests were YES or NO based on other factors.\n\nI think the high arrest count is significant enough to lean towards YES for rearrest, but considering he's employed and hasn't used drugs recently, it might balance a bit. However, the multiple prior arrests are a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old; no direct correlation in examples\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity not directly influencing recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"3 arrests indicating higher risk\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"1 conviction adds to risk but less than multiple convictions\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job; employment can be protective but limited here\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with mother in a small household\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role, potentially reducing support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
