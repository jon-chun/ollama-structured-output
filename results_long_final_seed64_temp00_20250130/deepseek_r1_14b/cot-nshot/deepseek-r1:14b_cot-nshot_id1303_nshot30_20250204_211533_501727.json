    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, prior arrests and convictions are significant. In many cases where someone has been arrested multiple times, especially with a conviction, it increases the likelihood of rearrest. So this is probably a high-weight factor.\n\nNext, his education status: he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. From the examples, lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because limited education can lead to fewer job opportunities. This seems like a medium weight since it's important but not as critical as prior arrests.\n\nHe weighs between 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight (pun intended) this has in the examples. It might relate to health issues or social perceptions, but I don't recall body weight being a major factor in recidivism in the provided cases. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's living alone and hasn't been married. In some examples, living with family was seen as protective, so living alone could be a risk factor. But it's not as strong as others. Medium weight perhaps.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can indicate ongoing substance issues which might lead to further criminal behavior. This seems like a medium weight because drug involvement is significant but varies by context.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which could be positive. However, mental health issues not addressed might still pose risks. Since he's not currently showing signs of depression, maybe low weight here.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his mother in a household of size 3. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and family dynamics matter. But compared to prior arrests, this is probably medium weight because it's more about environment than direct criminal history.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, spirituality was seen as protective, so maybe low weight here since it might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are prior arrests and convictions; medium are education status, living alone, drug use, urban upbringing; low are weight, mental health, spirituality.\n\nConsidering the examples where similar factors led to YES outcomes, especially with multiple arrests and lack of education, I think this case is likely to result in rearrest. My confidence is around 70% because while some factors like drug use and environment contribute, others like not being depressed might slightly lower the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education may limit opportunities, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Body weight is not directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could be a risk factor compared to living with family\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use may indicate ongoing issues that could lead to further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression, which might slightly reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and family dynamics may contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence could act as a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
