    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old Black female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18 or 19 had mixed outcomes. It's a low-medium factor because age alone isn't definitive but might indicate higher risk due to being in a peak crime period.\n\nShe identifies as Black. In some examples, race was mentioned, but it didn't always lead to recidivism. I'll rate this as low since other factors might be more influential.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. In the examples, even with arrests without convictions, outcomes varied. This seems low because a single arrest without conviction might not strongly predict future behavior.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so they're out of scope.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage is often seen as a protective factor against recidivism. In the examples, being married was associated with lower risk. So this is a high-weight factor because it suggests stability.\n\nHas a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor, but without current enrollment, the impact might be medium. I'll rate this as low-medium since diploma alone may not strongly influence recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. This should be a high-weight factor because steady employment can indicate responsibility and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Abstaining from drugs is positive, but it's a single data point. I'll rate this as low-medium since it's good but not the strongest predictor.\n\nShe felt down some times in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor for recidivism. This should be medium because emotional struggles might lead to relapse or poor decisions.\n\nLived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Family environment and support can influence behavior. Urban areas may have higher crime rates, so this is a low-medium factor as it's somewhat indicative but not the strongest.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. Spirituality can be protective, reducing recidivism. This should be medium because having a strong belief system might deter criminal activity.\n\nNow, considering all factors: she has positive aspects like marriage, employment, no drug use, and spirituality. However, she's young, felt down, and comes from an urban environment. The strongest factors are her marriage (high) and employment (high), which likely lower her risk. Her mental health struggles and living situation might increase it slightly.\n\nLooking at the examples, similar profiles with high protective factors often resulted in \"NO\" for recidivism. So I'm leaning towards NO, but there's some uncertainty due to her age and emotional state.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; may be at a peak risk period for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals in examples had mixed outcomes\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"low\", \"Arrested once but not convicted, which is less concerning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Married and living with spouse indicates potential for stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may have limited protective effect\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived in an urban area with mother and siblings; mixed impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Believes God influences her life, which may reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is positive but not a strong protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
