    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 21-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested five times and convicted. Looking at the examples, high arrest/conviction counts usually lead to a \"YES.\" For instance, Example 6 had 5 arrests and was a \"YES,\" while others with fewer arrests were often \"NO.\"\n\nNext, his education is a GED without college enrollment. In previous cases, lack of higher education was sometimes linked to recidivism but wasn't the strongest factor on its own.\n\nHe's living alone, which in some examples correlated with higher risk because support systems might be lacking. However, it's not always definitive.\n\nEmployment-wise, he only held one job in the past year. In Examples like 27 and 30, having a job didn't prevent rearrest, but consistent employment can be protective. Here, since it's just one job, it's a bit concerning.\n\nHe used marijuana recently, which is a moderate risk factor. Drug use often increases recidivism chances, especially if it leads to further drug-related offenses.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month might lower his mental health issues, which could be protective but not a major factor here.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in an urban area with a household size of five: family support can be positive, but urban areas may have more risks. This is a bit mixed, so I'll consider it low to medium.\n\nLastly, he believes God influences his life. In examples, this belief sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, acting as a protective factor.\n\nWeighing all these, the strongest factors are the high number of arrests and convictions, followed by recent drug use. His living situation and employment status add some risk but aren't as significant. The presence of family support might mitigate some risks. Overall, considering similar cases, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"5 prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism as seen in examples like #6.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED without college enrollment is less protective compared to higher education, but not a major risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may indicate limited social support, which could be a moderate risk factor as seen in examples like #27 and #30.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"Having held 1 job in the past year shows some stability but is not strongly protective against recidivism compared to consistent employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use indicates potential ongoing substance abuse, which is a strong predictor of recidivism as seen in examples like #29 and #30.\"),\n    (\"Depression symptoms\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month reduces risk compared to cases where mental health issues were present, such as example #28.\"),\n    (\"Family background/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological father in an urban area with a household size of 5 may provide some support but also exposes him to potential negative influences, similar to examples like #6 and #14.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/belief in God's influence\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with what happens is generally seen as a protective factor, though not always sufficient on its own, as seen in example #27.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
