    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 19 or 20 had outcomes both ways, but being 18 might still be a high risk because she's just starting out and possibly more impulsive.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, even one arrest sometimes led to rearrests, so this is probably a medium factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here, so I'll skip that.\n\nShe's living alone, which in some examples was linked to higher risk because of less support. But she's enrolled in school, which usually indicates lower risk. So maybe low for living alone but balanced by her education.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Employment is generally a protective factor against recidivism, so that should be low risk.\n\nShe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially when combined with other issues. This might be high.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times recently, indicating possible mental health struggles or stress. Emotional distress can contribute to recidivism, so medium here.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Family structure and environment are important; having both parents might mitigate risk, but being in an urban area could mean more exposure to crime. So maybe low for family support but medium overall considering the environment.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so probably a low factor.\n\nNow, weighing all these: drug use is high, emotional issues are medium, arrest history and living alone are medium, while education and employment are low. The strongest factors here are the drug use and emotional state. Looking at similar cases where drug use was present and mental health issues were noted, rearrest rates were higher.\n\nSo I think she's more likely to recidivate. My confidence is around 65% because while there are protective factors like education and employment, the negative factors are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old may indicate higher risk due to immaturity and potential for impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction; past arrests can be a predictor of future recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone might suggest less social support, but not necessarily high risk on its own\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school, which is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs this year; employment can be a protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Felt down in the dumps some times in the past month, indicating possible emotional distress which could contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban area; family structure may provide some stability but urban environment can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens to her; spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
