    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 21-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, prior arrests are a strong indicator. For instance, in Example 1, someone with two arrests and a conviction had a \"YES.\" So this is a high-weight factor.\n\nNext, his weight is 260 lbs. Obesity can be linked to various health issues but not directly to recidivism. However, it might affect other factors like employment or mental health. I don't see examples where weight was a direct cause, so maybe low impact here.\n\nHe's living alone now. In some cases, having social support reduces recidivism. But in Example 27, someone living with others still had \"NO.\" So being alone might be neutral; perhaps medium weight because it could indicate isolation but not directly tied to crime.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism. In Examples like 19, higher education led to \"NO.\" But since he's only got a diploma, maybe low impact as it's baseline.\n\nHe held one job this year. Employment is generally good, but having only one might not be stable. In Example 27, someone with a GED and one job had \"NO,\" so perhaps medium weight because inconsistent employment could still pose some risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is significant. Many examples showed drug use leading to rearrest, like Examples 1, 3, etc., which were \"YES.\" So this should be high weight as substance abuse often correlates with crime.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. In Example 29, depression led to \"YES,\" so medium weight because it's a concern but not as strong as prior arrests or drug use.\n\nLiving in an urban area with his mother in a household of size 3. Urban areas have higher crime rates, and family dynamics can influence behavior. However, without more info on the environment, maybe low impact since other factors are stronger.\n\nBelieves God influences events. In Examples like 1, someone had similar beliefs but still rearrested. It might offer some support but not directly prevent crime, so low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: high-weight factors (arrests/drugs) suggest higher risk, while others have mixed or lower weights. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction are strong indicators of potential recidivism, as seen in examples like Example 1 where prior arrests led to a 'YES' outcome.\"),\n    (\"weight_obesity\", \"low\", \"While obesity may impact health, it is not directly linked to recidivism risk in the provided examples.
