    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 22-year-old Black female will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18-19 year olds were sometimes predicted as YES or NO depending on other factors. Age alone doesn't seem to be a high risk here since she's an adult, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once and convicted. In previous cases, having a conviction history was often a medium factor because it indicates past law involvement, but not extremely severe. So, I'll assign medium here.\n\nShe weighs 130 lbs, which is within a normal range for her height and age. Weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk unless it's part of health issues, so this is low.\n\nShe's living alone now. In examples, living alone sometimes was associated with higher risk because of less support, but not always. I'll consider this medium since it might indicate isolation.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can be protective, but without further education or employment, it might be a slight risk. So, low to medium\u2014probably medium here.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor because it can lead to further criminal behavior. This is definitely high risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not currently depressed, this is low.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 9 in a rural area. Family environment can influence behavior, but without more info on family dynamics, it's medium.\n\nLastly, she believes God influences her life. In examples, spirituality sometimes was protective, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: one high (drug use), several mediums (conviction history, living alone, family environment), and the rest lows. The drug use is a strong indicator, but other factors like employment and education might mitigate some risk. However, given her arrest and conviction, along with ongoing drug use, I think she's at higher risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is within a typical adult range and not indicative of high recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates past involvement but not severe history\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate potential isolation or lack of support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may be a moderate factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms currently\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with mother in a rural area may have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence on life, generally protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
