    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals seem more prone to recidivism, especially if they're still in their late teens. So I'll give this a medium weight because it's a significant factor but not the most critical on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Looking at previous cases, multiple arrests are a strong indicator of potential rearrest. For example, someone with 3 arrests was predicted \"YES.\" So this is high priority.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism; without it, job prospects are limited. This seems medium because education isn't the strongest factor but still plays a role.\n\nShe's living alone, which might mean less support. In some examples, living with family was protective, so living alone could be riskier. I'll rate this as low since it's not the most impactful but contributes.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for rearrest. This should be medium because drug issues can lead to more crime.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times recently, indicating possible mental health struggles. Mental health issues can affect behavior and recidivism chances. Medium weight here as it's significant but not the top factor.\n\nLived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area. Family support might be mixed; rural areas could have fewer resources. This is low because family dynamics are important but less so than other factors.\n\nBelieves God influences events, which can be both positive (support) and negative (fatalism). I'll give this low weight as it's not directly linked to recidivism in the examples.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone, drug use, mental health issues. These are strong indicators pointing towards rearrest. So my prediction is \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (19)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a risk factor for recidivism as individuals in their late teens may still be developing\"),\n    (\"number of arrests (3)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates, especially when combined with convictions\"),\n    (\"lack of high school diploma/ged and not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Education is linked to lower recidivism; lack thereof can indicate limited opportunities\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, but it's less impactful than other factors\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can be a contributing factor to recidivism as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"reported feeling down in the dumps recently\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"grew up in a rural area with household size 3 and biological mother\", \"low\", \"Family dynamics and environment may influence but are less directly correlated to recidivism\"),\n    (\"believes god has an influence on events\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can be protective, but it's not a direct indicator of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
