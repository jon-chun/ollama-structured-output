    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old Hispanic female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18 or 19 had varying outcomes. Sometimes being young was a low risk, but it's not a determining factor alone.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. In previous cases, multiple arrests were sometimes weighted as medium because they indicate repeated issues, even without convictions.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem to be factors in the examples provided, so I'll ignore those.\n\nShe's living alone, which was a factor in some examples. Sometimes living alone was seen as low risk, but other times it didn't matter much. I think this might be a low or medium factor depending on context.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. In the examples, education level varied; sometimes it was neutral, so maybe this is low risk.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor for recidivism. In previous cases, not having a job often led to higher recidivism rates, so I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, which should lower her risk. This would likely be a low or medium factor, but since she's clean now, it might help reduce her overall risk.\n\nShe has felt depressed most of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism because stress and depression may lead to criminal behavior as an outlet. I'd consider this a high-risk factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of 5. Family support can be protective, but living in an urban area might expose her to more negative influences. This could be a medium risk because while family support is good, the environment isn't ideal.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her. In some examples, spirituality was seen as positive and possibly reducing recidivism, so this might be low risk.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: unemployment (high), mental health (high), three arrests (medium), living alone (low-medium), education (low), no drug use (low), family support but urban environment (medium). The strongest factors are her lack of employment and current depression, which both are high risks. Her multiple arrests add to that.\n\nLooking at the examples where similar factors were present, like Example 29, she had three arrests, was unemployed, and had mental health issues, leading to a \"YES.\" So I think this case would also result in a rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old; age is not a strong predictor but may slightly increase risk\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"medium\", \"3 arrests without conviction; indicates potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, but not a major factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma; education is neutral in this context\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year; unemployment is a strong risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depressed most of the time; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area; mixed influence from family and environment\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role; may provide some support but not a strong protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
