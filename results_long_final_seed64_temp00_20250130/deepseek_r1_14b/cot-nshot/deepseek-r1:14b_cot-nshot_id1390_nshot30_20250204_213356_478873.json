    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's White. Looking at examples, race didn't seem to be a significant factor in previous cases, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted. In the examples, higher arrest counts (like 3 or more) often led to YES outcomes. So this is high risk.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Many examples with similar education levels had recidivism, so medium here.\n\nCurrently living alone. Previous cases showed that living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, but it's not the strongest factor, so low impact.\n\nEmployment: held 1 job during the year. In some cases, consistent work reduced risk, but since he only has one job, maybe medium?\n\nDrug use: hasn't used in four years. This is a positive sign, so low risk here.\n\nMental health: not depressed recently. Another positive factor, so low impact.\n\nFamily background: lived with mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban areas can mean more opportunities for crime, but without other factors like family issues, it's medium.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has nothing to do with his life. In examples where individuals had strong religious beliefs, recidivism was lower. So this absence might increase risk, making it high.\n\nNow, weighting each factor:\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: High (5 times)\n- Education level: Medium\n- Employment status: Medium\n- Family background: Medium\n- Religious belief: High\n\nOther factors are low impact. Considering the examples where multiple medium and high factors led to YES outcomes, especially with 5 arrests and no diploma, I think recidivism is likely.\n\nConfidence is around 70% because while there are several risk factors, some protective factors like not using drugs and not being depressed might reduce the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old, which is young but not inherently high risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race did not significantly impact recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and convictions indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college correlates with higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is less common in examples but not the strongest factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year, which may indicate some stability but limited\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with mother in a household of 3 suggests potential challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"high\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life may indicate lower self-control, increasing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
