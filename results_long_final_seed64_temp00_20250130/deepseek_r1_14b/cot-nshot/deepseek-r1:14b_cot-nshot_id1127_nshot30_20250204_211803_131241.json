    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's Hispanic, and while race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's more about socioeconomic context rather than ethnicity itself.\n\nArrested four times and convicted. That's a significant indicator because multiple arrests and convictions strongly correlate with higher recidivism chances.\n\nWeight is high (200-224 lbs), but weight alone isn't a direct risk factor unless it relates to health issues or other behaviors, which doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nLiving alone might be a slight concern as having social support can reduce recidivism. However, he's not married, so that's another point towards potential higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education generally reduces recidivism. Not being enrolled could mean less structure or fewer opportunities.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment can be a positive factor as it provides stability, but having only two jobs might not be sufficient if they're part-time or unstable.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially when combined with prior arrests and convictions.\n\nNot felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate, so it's a moderate consideration.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 3. Family structure can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Multiple arrests/convictions: High (strong indicator)\n- Hispanic ethnicity: Medium (contextual factors)\n- Education level: Low (but not protective enough)\n- Employment status: Low (two jobs might help but not strongly)\n- Drug use: High (significant risk)\n- Living alone: Medium (less support systems)\n- Family background: Low (urban setting could be neutral or negative, but family presence is positive)\n- Spiritual beliefs: Low (positive influence)\n\nConsidering all factors, the high arrest/conviction and drug use are strong indicators towards recidivism. The mitigating factors like education, employment, and spiritual beliefs might help, but they're not enough to outweigh the significant risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is a common age for recidivism but not inherently high risk\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and convictions indicate higher likelihood of future offenses\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight alone is not a direct risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma provides some stability but not strongly protective\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs shows responsibility but may be part-time and unstable\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, which is positive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban living with both parents could have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide support but not a strong mitigator\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married might indicate fewer responsibilities, potentially higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
