    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will recidivate within three years based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a major factor unless combined with others. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I don't see this explicitly mentioned in the examples as a risk factor, so perhaps it's not weighted much. Maybe low.\n\nArrested 9 times and convicted. In previous cases, high arrest counts (like 9) often led to YES outcomes. This seems like a strong indicator, so high weight.\n\nHe is 5'9\" and weighs 180 lbs. No examples linked height or weight directly, so probably low.\n\nNever married. Some examples had marital status, but it didn't seem critical. Maybe low.\n\nLiving alone. In some cases, living with others was a factor, but not sure about living alone. Could be medium if considered as a risk factor, but I'm not certain.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is often linked to recidivism. Previous examples showed that lack of education was sometimes a factor, so maybe medium.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator. In examples, holding no jobs led to higher recidivism rates, so high weight here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Examples often highlighted drug use as a key factor, so medium or high? Maybe medium since it's recent but not severe.\n\nLived in a household of size 8 when young. Family environment can influence recidivism, but I'm not sure how much. Probably low.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life. In examples, this sometimes appeared as a protective factor, so maybe low or neutral.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Arrest/conviction: high\n- No job: high\n- Drug use: medium\n- Age 19: low\n- Education level: medium\n- Living alone: low\n- Household size: low\n- Race: low\n- Marital status: low\n- Belief in God: low\n\nLooking at the examples, when there were multiple high-weight factors like arrest counts and unemployment, recidivism was more likely. This case has two high factors (arrests and no job) and a medium for drug use.\n\nComparing to previous cases where similar factors led to YES outcomes, I think this person is likely to recidivate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old; not explicitly linked in examples\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut; no direct correlation observed\"),\n    (\"arrest_count_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested 9 times and convicted, a strong indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'9\\\" and 180 lbs; not significant in examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; no direct link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate weaker social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled, linked to higher risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the year, a strong negative indicator\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use, a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of 8; not directly significant\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God is involved; possibly protective but low weight\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
