    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 21-year-old Hispanic male will recidivate within three years. Let's break down each risk factor based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is relatively young but not extremely so. In previous cases, younger ages were sometimes associated with higher risks, but I'm not sure if 21 is a significant factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, prior convictions seem to be a moderate risk factor. For instance, in Example 1, someone had one arrest and was predicted YES. So maybe this is a medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is another point. In Examples like 27 and 28, lack of education was present but didn't always lead to recidivism. It might be a low-medium factor because it's somewhat common but not the strongest indicator.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, which in some cases (like Example 1) was associated with higher risk. So maybe medium here as well.\n\nEmployment: He has held one job during the year. In Examples like 29 and 30, employment was present but didn't prevent recidivism. Maybe low weight since having a job is somewhat protective but not always.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) was present in several examples, both YES and NO outcomes. It seems to be a moderate factor because it's a known risk indicator but not the sole determinant.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Urban areas might have more challenges, so this could be low-medium as it adds some context but isn't a direct cause.\n\nSpirituality: Believes God has a role in his life. In Examples like 1 and 27, similar beliefs were present but didn't prevent recidivism. This might be low because spirituality can be both protective and not always indicative.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are prior conviction and drug use (medium each), with others being lower. Considering the examples where similar factors led to YES outcomes, I think this case is leaning towards YES but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"low\", \"Age is a moderate risk factor as it's relatively young but not extremely low\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having been convicted once indicates a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_highschool_diploma Ged\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can be a significant barrier and may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate limited social support, but it's not the strongest factor\"),\n    (\"employed_one_job\", \"low\", \"Having held one job shows some stability but is not a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use can be a moderate risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"urban_household_size_4\", \"low\", \"Urban living and household size may indicate certain challenges but are not direct predictors\"),\n    (\"spirituality_God_influence\", \"low\", \"Spirituality might offer some protective factors but isn't the strongest indicator\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
