    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 21-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at his age: he's 21, which is relatively young but not extremely so. In the examples provided, younger ages like 19 and 20 sometimes led to recidivism, especially when other high-risk factors were present. So I'll rate this as a medium risk because being in one's early twenties can still be a period of higher risk.\n\nNext, he has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. In the examples, prior arrests without convictions didn't always lead to rearrests, but having two arrests might indicate some level of involvement with the law. I'll consider this as a medium risk factor because it's significant but not definitive on its own.\n\nHe identifies as Black. From the examples, race seemed to play a role in recidivism rates, especially when combined with other factors. However, without more context, I'll rate this as low since there are cases where being Black didn't lead to rearrests, especially if other factors are favorable.\n\nHis height and weight (6'1\" and 170 lbs) don't seem to be risk factors on their own. There's no direct correlation between physical stature and recidivism in the examples provided, so I'll assign a low weight here.\n\nHe's never been married. In some cases, marital status can influence behavior, but it's not a strong indicator by itself. Since he's living alone now, this might suggest independence, which could be positive. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nLiving alone currently: in the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risks because of less support systems. However, without more context on his living situation's stability, it's a bit tricky. I'll consider this medium risk because it's a factor but not the most significant one.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can be protective against recidivism, so having a diploma is positive. However, not being enrolled might mean he's not seeking further education or employment opportunities. This could be a slight negative, so I'll rate this as low risk but slightly leaning towards medium.\n\nHe has held one job during the year: steady employment is generally a good indicator of lower recidivism. Having a job shows responsibility and provides income, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity. I'll assign a high weight here because consistent employment is a strong protective factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years: substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism. His clean record here is very positive, so this will be a high-weighted protective factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month: mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. His lack of depression is a good sign, but I'll rate it as low because other factors might have more influence.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 during his youth: larger family sizes can sometimes mean less individual attention and possibly higher exposure to negative influences. However, without specific information on the family dynamics, this is a bit uncertain. I'll consider this medium risk but not too high.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally: religious beliefs can be protective against recidivism by providing a sense of purpose and accountability. This is a positive factor, so I'll rate it as low risk because it's beneficial but might not be the strongest influence on its own.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he has several positive indicators like employment and no drug use, which are strong protective factors. However, he also has prior arrests, lives alone, and comes from a larger household, which could increase his risk. The balance seems to lean towards moderate risk but not extremely high.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, when there were multiple low-risk factors and some medium ones, the outcome was often \"NO\" for rearrest. However, in cases where prior arrests were present along with other moderate risks, sometimes it led to a \"YES.\" \n\nGiven that he has two prior arrests but no convictions, is employed, and has no drug use or mental health issues, I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" for rearrest. The positive factors seem to outweigh the negative ones in this case.\n\nFor confidence, considering the balance of factors, I'd say around 70%. There's a notable risk due to prior arrests and living situation but also strong protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; early twenties can be a period of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions, indicating some legal involvement\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Black identity; examples show mixed impact but not definitive\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism in provided examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; could indicate independence or lack of support\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest less support, though not conclusive\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college; mixed impact\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Steady employment is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No use in past four years; significant protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of 5; could have exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Positive influence but not the strongest factor\")\n  ],\n  \"predicted_outcome\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
