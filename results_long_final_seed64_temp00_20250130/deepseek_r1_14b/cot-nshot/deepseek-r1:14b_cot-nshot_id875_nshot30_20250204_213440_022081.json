    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, arrest without conviction seems to be a low-weight factor because in some cases like Example 27 and 30, people with one arrest didn't rearrest. So I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNext, his education: he has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. In previous examples, lack of higher education was sometimes linked to recidivism but not always. It's probably medium because it's somewhat indicative but not the strongest factor.\n\nHe lives alone now, which is interesting. In some cases, living with others might provide support, so living alone could be a risk. I'll give this a low weight since it's not a direct indicator of behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be a high-weight factor because steady work can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. In examples like 29 and others, drug use was present but didn't always lead to rearrest. However, it's still a significant risk factor, so I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so the absence of depression here might be protective. This should be a high-weight factor because mental stability is important.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of six. Family structure and environment matter, but having a supportive family might mitigate risks. However, living in an urban area could expose him to more negative influences. I'll give this a medium weight as it's a mixed factor.\n\nHe believes God plays a role in his life. In examples like 29, spirituality was present but didn't prevent rearrest. It can be protective, so maybe high weight because having a strong belief system might deter crime.\n\nNow, considering all factors: one arrest (low), GED (medium), living alone (low), two jobs (high), drug use (medium), no depression (high), family environment (medium), spirituality (high). \n\nThe positive factors like employment and mental health are strong. The arrest is low risk since it's not a conviction, and he hasn't used drugs recently except marijuana. His belief in God adds another protective layer.\n\nOverall, the protective factors seem to outweigh the risks. So I'll predict \"NO\" for rearrest with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (1 arrest, no conviction)\", \"low\", \"In examples like #27 and #30, individuals with one arrest but no conviction did not rearrest.
