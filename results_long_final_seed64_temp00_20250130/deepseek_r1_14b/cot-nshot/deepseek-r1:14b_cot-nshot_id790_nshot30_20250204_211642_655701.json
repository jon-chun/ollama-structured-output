    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, even a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to recidivism (like Example 27), so this might be a medium risk.\n\nHe weighs between 175-199 lbs and is 6 feet tall. In previous cases, weight didn't seem to directly correlate with rearrest unless it's extreme, but I don't have enough info here, so maybe low impact.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision, which might be a risk factor. Examples showed living alone sometimes led to recidivism, so medium here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is usually protective against crime, so this might lower the risk, but not sure how much\u2014maybe low.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a strong protective factor, reducing the likelihood of rearrest. So this should be a medium or high positive factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is present. In examples, drug use often led to recidivism, so this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently\u2014mental health issues can contribute to crime, but since he's not depressed now, maybe low impact here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a rural area with household size 5. Family stability can be protective, but rural areas might have different factors. In examples, family presence sometimes helped reduce recidivism, so this could be medium positive.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spirituality can deter crime, so this is likely a high protective factor.\n\nNow, balancing all these: arrests (medium), employment (high positive), drug use (high negative), family stability (medium positive), spirituality (high positive). The positives might outweigh the negatives, but the arrest history and drug use are significant. Looking at similar examples where some factors were present but others weren't, I'm leaning towards NO recidivism, but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction can be a moderate risk factor as it shows potential for legal issues\"),\n    (\"Weight and Height\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation to rearrest based on weight and height alone\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less supervision, which could be a moderate risk\"),\n    (\"Education Status\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs suggests stability and responsibility, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use can be a strong indicator of potential legal issues\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a stable household may provide some protection\"),\n    (\"Spirituality Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Believing God influences life can deter criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
