    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18 or 19 had mixed outcomes. Sometimes they rearrested, sometimes not. So age alone might be a low factor unless combined with others.\n\nShe's American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I don't see this explicitly mentioned in the examples, but race can impact recidivism rates due to systemic issues. However, since it's not directly listed as a factor in the examples, maybe it's a medium weight because of potential societal factors.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. In previous cases, arrests without convictions sometimes didn't lead to rearrests, so this might be low. But two arrests could indicate a pattern, so perhaps medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism; lower education can mean fewer opportunities. This seems like a medium factor because it's a known risk but not the strongest.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage usually reduces recidivism, so this should be low as it's a protective factor.\n\nWeight 140 lbs at 5'5\" is within a healthy range, so body weight doesn't seem to impact recidivism here. Low factor.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator; many examples where drug use led to rearrests. This should be high because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nFelt down in the dumps some times in the past month, indicating possible depression or stress. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so medium factor.\n\nLived in a rural area with her mother in a household of size 3 as a child. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but it's not a direct cause. Maybe low unless combined with other factors.\n\nBelieves God influences events. Spirituality can be protective, reducing recidivism, so this is a low factor.\n\nNow, weighting each:\n\n- Drug use: High (strongest)\n- Mental health: Medium\n- Education level: Medium\n- Arrests: Medium\n- Age: Low\n- Race: Medium (but not in examples)\n- Living situation: Low\n- Weight: Low\n- Spirituality: Low\n\nConsidering the high weight on drug use and medium on mental health and education, it's likely she'll rearrest. But her marriage is a protective factor. Looking at similar cases where drug use was high but had some positives, like being married, maybe it's a 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19)\", \"low\", \"Youth can be a risk but not definitive\"),\n    (\"Race (American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut)\", \"medium\", \"Potential systemic issues\"),\n    (\"Arrests without conviction (2 times)\", \"medium\", \"Indicates possible pattern\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"Education linked to opportunities\"),\n    (\"Married and living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Protective factor\"),\n    (\"Weight (140 lbs at 5'5\\\")\", \"low\", \"Healthy weight, no direct link\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Strong indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Feels down in dumps recently\", \"medium\", \"Mental health impact\"),\n    (\"Rural upbringing with mother\", \"low\", \"Access to resources may be limited\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences events\", \"low\", \"Spirituality as protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
