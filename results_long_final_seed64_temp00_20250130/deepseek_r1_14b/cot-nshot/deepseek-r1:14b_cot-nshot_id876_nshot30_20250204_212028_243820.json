    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 19 or 20 had varying outcomes, but age alone doesn't seem to be a strong indicator unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe's white. In the examples, race didn't consistently predict recidivism, so I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nArrested twice without conviction: In previous cases, even one arrest sometimes led to rearrest, especially if there were other risk factors. So this is a medium factor because multiple arrests can indicate higher risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so they're low.\n\nShe's unmarried and living alone. Unmarried status might be neutral, but living alone could mean less support, making it a low-medium factor.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism; higher education often correlates with lower rates. Since she's not currently studying, this is medium.\n\nNo jobs during the year: Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because it limits opportunities and increases stress. This should be high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years: Substance abuse is a major risk factor for rearrest. High impact here.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently: Mental health can influence behavior, but since she's not currently depressed, this might mitigate some risk, making it low-medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a size 4 household. Stable family environment usually reduces recidivism, so this is low.\n\nBelieves God influences her life: In examples, spirituality sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. Low impact.\n\nNow, weighting these factors:\n\nHigh: No jobs (employment issues), Drug use.\nMedium: Arrested twice, Education status, Family background, Mental health.\nLow: Age, Race, Living alone, Spirituality.\n\nConsidering the high factors are significant, especially drug use and unemployment, which are strong predictors. However, she has a stable family background and hasn't been convicted yet. The balance suggests a medium to high risk but not certain.\n\nLooking at similar examples where drug use was present and employment issues existed, rearrest rates were higher. But her lack of convictions might lower the risk slightly.\n\nI'll predict \"YES\" with 65% confidence because the positive factors (family, no depression) don't outweigh the negatives enough to be certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; age is not a strong predictor on its own\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race does not consistently predict recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_prior_to_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrested twice without conviction, indicating potential risk\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"5'2\\\" and 115 lbs; physical attributes are not relevant to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; marital status alone is neutral\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate but not enrolled in college; education can influence opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year; unemployment is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine recently; substance abuse correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not depressed recently; mental health status may influence behavior but not strongly here\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in a stable household; positive family environment can reduce risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality_importance\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences her life; spirituality may have mitigating effects but is weak predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
