    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 20-year-old White female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Looking at the examples, younger individuals (teens) sometimes had higher recidivism rates, but since she's in her early twenties, this might not be a significant factor here. I'll rate this as low because age alone isn't enough unless combined with others.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, first-time arrests without convictions often didn't lead to rearrests, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Body weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's an issue related to health or size, which isn't mentioned here. So, I'll consider this as low.\n\nShe's never been married. In the examples, marital status didn't seem to impact recidivism much, so this is a low factor.\n\nCurrently living alone might be a consideration because having social support can reduce recidivism. However, she's only 20 and might not have strong community ties yet. I'll rate this as medium since it's somewhat relevant but not the strongest indicator.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so having a diploma should be a positive factor. This will be a medium weight because while education helps, other factors might have more influence.\n\nShe held 4 jobs during the year. Employment is a strong indicator of stability and lower recidivism. Consistent work suggests she's trying to stay on track, so this gets a high weight.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it leads to substance abuse issues or criminal behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted, maybe her usage isn't severe. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health is important, but without a history of issues, this might not be a significant factor here. So, low weight.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a rural household of size 5. Family stability can reduce recidivism, especially if the environment was supportive. However, living in a rural area might limit access to resources. I'll give this a medium weight because family support is positive but location could be a slight drawback.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her life events. Spirituality can sometimes provide coping mechanisms, so lacking that connection might slightly increase risk factors. This will be low since it's not a major influence on behavior in the examples provided.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: she has several positive aspects like education and employment, which are strong protective factors. However, her drug use and living alone could pose some risks. The majority of the weighted factors lean towards lower risk, especially with her stable job history and education. Looking at similar cases where individuals had a high school diploma, steady jobs, and no convictions despite past arrests, rearrest rates were low.\n\nI think the prediction should be \"NO\" for rearrest within three years. My confidence is around 75% because while there are some risk factors like drug use, her positive attributes likely outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old; age alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest but no conviction; first-time offenders often have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not directly correlate with recidivism in the provided examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, which is common and not a significant factor\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests some level of stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Consistent employment over the year is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may indicate potential for substance-related offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month; mental health status not specified otherwise\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a rural area, which could be protective but also limited resources\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with her life events; lack of spiritual support may slightly increase risk\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
