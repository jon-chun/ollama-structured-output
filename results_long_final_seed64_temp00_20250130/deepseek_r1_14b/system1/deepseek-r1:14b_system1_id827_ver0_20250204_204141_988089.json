    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male, White. Age is a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates, but I shouldn't generalize too much.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior, which is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem to be relevant here unless there's an issue with physical aggression or size, but I don't have info on that.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can influence risk; not living alone might mean he has some support, but being unmarried at 18 is common, so maybe not a big factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment often correlates with higher risk because it limits job opportunities and can lead to involvement in criminal activities. Unemployment is another factor here since he's only held one job during the year. Limited employment history suggests instability, which could be a risk indicator.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is linked to higher recidivism rates and can impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but since he's not depressed now, that might slightly lower the risk, though other factors still weigh heavily.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size 3. Family environment can influence behavior; larger families might have different dynamics, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, but I'm not sure how that plays into criminal risk assessment here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. Educational and employment factors add to that, as does recent drug use. His age is somewhat mitigated by being 18, but still a concern. So overall, he's likely at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
