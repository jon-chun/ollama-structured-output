    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability and more impulsive behavior. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates, though that's a generalization.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential risk because they show past law-breaking behavior. The fact that he's been convicted means there's a record of legal trouble, which could be a red flag.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'2\" and 145 lbs. I'm not sure how much this affects risk assessment directly, but sometimes taller individuals might be seen as more intimidating or capable of causing harm, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone could mean less support systems in place, which might contribute to higher risk if he lacks social ties that can help him stay on track.\n\nHe's enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the year. School enrollment is positive, as education can be a deterrent against crime. However, not having a job might indicate underemployment or lack of structure, which could be a risk factor if he's seeking other means to support himself.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant red flag because it can impair judgment and increase likelihood of criminal behavior. The fact that this is recent (past four years) makes it more concerning.\n\nNo reported depression over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but since he's not depressed now, this might slightly lower the risk in that aspect.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size 5. Larger family sizes can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates due to potential lack of supervision or more chaotic environments, though it's not always the case.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be both protective and potentially isolating depending on context. It might provide him with a sense of purpose but could also lead to radicalization in some cases.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators, drug use is another concern, living alone without a job might mean he's more vulnerable or has fewer supports. His age and gender also contribute. However, being enrolled in school is a positive factor. I'm leaning towards high risk because the negative factors outweigh the positives.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
