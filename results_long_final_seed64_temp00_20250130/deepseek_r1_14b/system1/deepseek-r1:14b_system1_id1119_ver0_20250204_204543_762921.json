    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability, but race isn't inherently a risk factor unless there are underlying issues like systemic problems or discrimination experiences.\n\nHe has been arrested six times without any convictions. Arrests alone don't always correlate with higher risk, especially if there's no conviction history. However, multiple arrests could indicate ongoing behavior that might lead to future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight\u20146'2\" and 140 lbs\u2014don't seem relevant unless they relate to physical altercations or specific crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Lack of strong social ties can sometimes be a risk factor because there's less support system in place. However, it's not definitive on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests educational challenges. Lower education levels can correlate with higher crime rates, but again, it's one piece of the puzzle.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which is a significant red flag. Unemployment can be linked to increased criminal activity as individuals might turn to illegal means for income.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse often co-occurs with criminal behavior, so this is a strong indicator of potential risk.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps all month, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health problems can contribute to risky behaviors, including criminal activity.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four might suggest a larger family dynamic, but without more context on support or challenges within that home, it's hard to assess. Lastly, his belief in God's role in his life could be either a protective factor (if it provides him with coping mechanisms) or something else if he feels victimized by circumstances.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and lack of education are strong indicators. While race and living situation aren't direct risk factors, they can intersect with other issues. The confidence level is around 75% because while there are several red flags, there's no conviction history which might have pushed it higher.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
