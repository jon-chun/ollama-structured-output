    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male, white. Age is quite young, which might be a factor since younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive. But being white doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk unless other factors are considered.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually correlate with higher recidivism rates. So this is a major point towards high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'3\" and 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how much this affects risk, but sometimes larger individuals might be seen as more intimidating or have more opportunities for criminal behavior, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Lack of marital ties can sometimes mean less accountability, which might contribute to higher risk. Living alone could mean fewer social supports, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked with higher crime rates because limited education can lead to fewer job opportunities and increased involvement in criminal activities. This is another negative factor.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having a job might indicate some stability, but only holding one job could mean he's underemployed or has a history of job instability, which isn't great for his overall situation.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. These are positive signs. Substance abuse is a common factor in recidivism, so the lack thereof is good. Not feeling depressed also reduces some risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family structure might not directly impact risk here unless there's dysfunction. However, living with both parents or stable guardians is often protective, so living with just the mother might be neutral to slightly negative.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious influence, which can sometimes be protective against crime if religion is a significant part of someone's life. But it's not a major factor on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. Educational issues and living situation could contribute, but his employment status and absence of drug use/depression are somewhat mitigating. His age might make him more likely to continue criminal behavior if he hasn't found stable alternatives.\n\nI think the high number of arrests and convictions would push this towards a \"YES\" for high risk. The confidence level is around 70% because while there are some positive factors, the negative ones are quite significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
