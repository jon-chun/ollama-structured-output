    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's a generalization and can vary widely.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race itself isn't a direct indicator, but it could relate to systemic issues like access to resources or discrimination, which might influence behavior. However, without more context on how race affects his situation here, I'm not sure it's a primary factor.\n\nArrested five times and convicted\u2014this is significant. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential future criminal behavior. Recidivism rates can be high for individuals with multiple offenses, especially if they've been through the system before.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with risk unless there's an underlying issue like health problems or gang involvement tied to physical size, but that's speculative here.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014living situation can impact risk. Being unsupported by a spouse might mean less accountability, but not necessarily high risk on its own. Not living alone could mean he has some social support, which might be protective.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014lack of education is often linked to higher crime rates because limited educational opportunities can lead to fewer job prospects and increased involvement in illegal activities. Unemployment during the year is another red flag; being unemployed can increase stress and the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior for income.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, as it can impair judgment and lead to further illegal activities to support the habit or cope with withdrawal symptoms.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently\u2014this indicates possible mental health issues. Depression or other mood disorders can contribute to criminal behavior if not managed properly. Mental health struggles might make someone more likely to act out impulsively or turn to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 4 with his biological mother\u2014family dynamics can play a role. Large families might have less parental supervision, leading to higher risk of delinquency. However, without knowing the specific family environment, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally\u2014spirituality can be both protective and potentially isolating depending on how it's used. It might provide a sense of purpose or coping mechanism, but if it leads to rigid thinking or withdrawal from support systems, it could be a risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests/convictions, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, lack of education\u2014all these factors point towards a high risk of future criminal behavior. The combination is concerning, especially the recent drug use and feelings of depression which might indicate ongoing struggles that could lead to further offenses.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
