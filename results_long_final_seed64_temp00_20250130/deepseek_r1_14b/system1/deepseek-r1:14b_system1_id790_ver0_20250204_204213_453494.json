    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher crime rates among males, but that's a broad generalization.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here; it's more about socioeconomic and environmental aspects tied to race rather than the identifier itself.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a red flag, especially if there was a conviction, but without one, it might indicate that charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. However, an arrest could still suggest potential for future issues.\n\nHeight and weight are average; I don't see how these directly impact risk assessment unless they relate to physical altercations, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, but it's not a direct indicator of risk. Being unmarried at 19 is normal and doesn't necessarily signal high risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher risk, but he has completed high school, which is a positive sign. Not being enrolled could mean various reasons, some neutral.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment stability is generally a good indicator. Having held two jobs suggests responsibility and ability to maintain employment, which is a mitigating factor against high risk.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years (marijuana). Drug use can be a concern, especially if it's recent. Marijuana use might indicate potential for substance abuse issues, which could correlate with higher criminal behavior, though not always directly.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is crucial; no current depression is positive, but past issues or other mental health factors aren't mentioned here.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Family stability can be protective. Growing up with both parents might reduce risk, but living in a rural area could have its own challenges, like limited resources or higher crime rates depending on the location.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and possibly deter from criminal behavior, which is another mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, male, had an arrest without conviction, used drugs recently, but has stable employment, education, and grew up in a stable family environment. The positive factors seem to outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I would lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
