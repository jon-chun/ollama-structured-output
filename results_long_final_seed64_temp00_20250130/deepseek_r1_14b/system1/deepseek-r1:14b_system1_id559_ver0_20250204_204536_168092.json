    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability and more impulsive behavior. However, being 18 isn't necessarily a red flag unless combined with other issues.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant risk factors because they indicate past criminal behavior. Recidivism rates suggest that someone with prior convictions is more likely to reoffend, especially if not properly rehabilitated.\n\nCurrently, he's living alone without being married. Living alone at 18 might mean he lacks a support system or family influence, which could contribute to higher risk. However, it's also common for young adults to live independently, so this factor alone isn't definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college but has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a mitigating factor because steady work might indicate responsibility and lower likelihood of criminal activity. However, holding multiple jobs could also suggest he's trying to cover up other activities or is under financial stress.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and recently felt down, even feeling depressed. Substance use, especially marijuana, can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors. Recent depression symptoms might indicate emotional instability, which could contribute to criminal behavior if not managed.\n\nGrowing up in a household of seven suggests a potentially chaotic environment, which can lead to behavioral issues or lack of proper guidance. Large families might have less parental supervision, increasing the chances of delinquency.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal events. This indicates he has some form of belief system, which could either provide stability (if positive) or possibly influence negative behaviors if tied to extremist views, though that's less likely here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. His current living situation, substance use, and recent depressive feelings add to the concern. The large household size in his youth might have contributed to behavioral issues. While employment is a positive factor, it doesn't outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I would assess this as a high-risk individual with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
