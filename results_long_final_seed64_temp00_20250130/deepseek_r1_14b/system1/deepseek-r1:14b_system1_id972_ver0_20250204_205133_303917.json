    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk in most assessment tools, so that might not be significant on its own.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests without convictions can vary; sometimes they indicate a lower risk if the case was dismissed or acquitted, but it's still an arrest which could suggest some level of involvement.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'10\" and 150-174 lbs. Physical stats usually don't correlate with criminal behavior unless in specific contexts like certain types of crimes, so probably not a major factor here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a slight risk indicator, but it's not a strong one on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates because of limited opportunities and potential involvement in criminal activities. This seems like a moderate risk factor.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment is generally seen as protective against crime, so having two jobs might actually be a positive sign, indicating stability and responsibility.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. No recent substance abuse or mental health issues are good signs, reducing risk factors in those areas.\n\nGrew up with her biological mother in an urban household of size 4. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family structure is more about support systems. Being raised by a biological mother might indicate a stable upbringing, though the exact impact varies.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with personal events. This seems like a personal belief and not directly related to criminal behavior unless it's part of a larger narrative, which I don't think it is here.\n\nPutting this all together: The strongest risk factors seem to be the lack of education and living alone. However, she has stable employment, no recent drug use or mental health issues, and hasn't been convicted despite an arrest. These mitigating factors might lower her overall risk. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate confidence level but not too high because while there are some red flags like education and living situation, other aspects suggest lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
