    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18, which is a young adult. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but it also depends on other factors.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, so that might not play a significant role here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, especially without a conviction, which could indicate a lack of prior legal trouble beyond the arrest.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'9\" and 185 lbs. Physical size might be relevant in certain contexts, like if it relates to confrontational crimes, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nLiving alone at 18 suggests he might not have strong family support or supervision. That could be a risk factor as lack of support can sometimes lead to higher propensity for issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can influence opportunities and potential pathways, but without further context on his plans or engagement, it's tricky.\n\nEmployment history: he held one job during the year. Steady employment is usually a positive sign, indicating responsibility, so this might actually be a protective factor rather than a risk.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent and frequent. However, since it's only marijuana and not more severe drugs, the risk might be moderate here.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is important; absence of depression could mean lower stressors contributing to criminal behavior.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable family environment can be protective, so this might reduce risk.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious influence, which sometimes is associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a direct indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some factors that could increase risk (arrest, drug use, living alone) and others that decrease it (education, employment, stable family background). The arrest without conviction might indicate he was in a situation where he got into trouble but didn't end up convicted, which could mean lower actual risk. His marijuana use is recent but not severe. The fact that he's employed and has a diploma suggests some level of responsibility.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate confidence that he might be at high risk, but I'm not entirely sure because there are both positive and negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
