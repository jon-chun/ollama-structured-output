    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might play a role. However, without more context on that, it's hard to assess.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk factor, especially if they're recent or multiple. A single arrest might not be too concerning unless there are other issues.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll set those aside.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less support system, which might increase risk, but it's a bit of a stretch without more info on her social network.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against crime, so this seems positive.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing recidivism chances, so that's another positive sign.\n\nUsed drugs (cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent and of a more serious drug like cocaine, is a significant red flag for potential criminal behavior or relapse into crime.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but absence here might mitigate that.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is usually protective, though urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence her environment.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Religious involvement is often associated with lower recidivism and better outcomes, so this is another positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of recent drug use (cocaine) stands out as a major risk factor. However, several protective factors like education, employment, living with parents early on, and religious beliefs might counterbalance that. Her single arrest without conviction isn't too concerning in isolation. So, while there are some risks, the overall picture doesn't strongly indicate high risk. I'd lean towards NO for high risk, maybe with a confidence around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
