    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher crime rates among males, but that's a broad generalization and can vary widely.\n\nRace is Black. I know that in some contexts, race can be a factor, but it's important to consider systemic issues rather than individual characteristics. However, without more context on how this affects his current situation, it's hard to assess directly.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but no convictions. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, especially if there were no convictions. It might indicate some past involvement but not necessarily a pattern of criminality.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; physical stats alone aren't strong indicators unless they relate to specific crimes, which isn't the case here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, potentially increasing risk factors, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education is often associated with lower crime rates. However, he's working three jobs, which shows responsibility and possibly financial stability, which might mitigate some risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so the absence here is positive. No recent depression also reduces psychological stressors that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five when he was young. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without knowing specifics about the environment (like conflict, support levels), it's hard to assess. Large households might have different challenges, but again, not enough info.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs are often associated with lower criminal behavior as they provide a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some minor red flags like arrests and living alone, but positive factors include no convictions, stable employment, no drug use, education, and strong religious beliefs. The overall risk doesn't seem high enough to warrant a 'YES' with significant confidence. Maybe around 40% confidence if leaning towards cautious optimism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
