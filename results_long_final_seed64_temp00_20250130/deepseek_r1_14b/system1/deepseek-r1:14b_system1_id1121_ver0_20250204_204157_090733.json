    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but typically an age where individuals might be more impulsive or at higher risk for criminal behavior. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates compared to females.\n\nRace can sometimes be a factor in some studies, though it's a sensitive area. However, I'm focusing on the other factors here. He has been arrested once but not convicted, which is a bit concerning because arrests can indicate potential future issues, even without a conviction.\n\nHe's living alone and hasn't been married, which might mean he lacks support systems or stable relationships that could help deter criminal behavior. Not having a high school diploma or GED and being unemployed for the past year are significant red flags. Lack of education and employment can lead to higher stress, fewer opportunities, and potentially more involvement in risky activities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs recently and doesn't report depression, which is positive. However, living in an urban area with a household size of five might indicate a chaotic environment or exposure to negative influences. His statement about God not being involved in his life could suggest a lack of strong moral support or community ties that might otherwise reduce risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014youth, male gender, arrest history, unemployment, lack of education, living alone\u2014it leans towards higher risk. However, the absence of recent drug use and depression slightly mitigates that risk. I'm not certain it's a definite high risk but leaning more towards yes with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
