    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that's a slight point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race alone isn't a determining factor, but it can sometimes correlate with socioeconomic factors or systemic issues, though I should be cautious not to overgeneralize here.\n\nArrested once and convicted once. A criminal record does increase the likelihood of recidivism, so that's a significant point towards high risk. However, since it's only one conviction, maybe it's not too severe unless the crime was serious.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to risk assessment in this context, so I can probably ignore those.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor as he might lack support systems to help him stay out of trouble. But it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against criminal behavior, so this should slightly reduce the risk assessment.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate limited income or instability, which could be a minor risk factor if he's under financial stress.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't as strongly correlated with violent crime as other substances, but any drug use can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, especially if it's part of a larger pattern or used in combination with other factors.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling so low that nothing cheered him up. Depression or recent emotional distress can be a risk factor for criminal behavior, particularly impulsive crimes or substance abuse as coping mechanisms.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family structure and environment matter; growing up in an urban area might expose one to more negative influences, but having stable parental figures could mitigate that. However, the exact impact is nuanced.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a sense of purpose and reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior, so this might slightly lower the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some factors that increase risk (male, prior conviction, possible emotional distress) and some that decrease it (education, employment, religious beliefs). The prior conviction is significant but not severe. His recent emotional state could be a tipping point if he's struggling. I'm leaning towards moderate to high risk because the negative factors are more impactful than the positive ones in this case.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
