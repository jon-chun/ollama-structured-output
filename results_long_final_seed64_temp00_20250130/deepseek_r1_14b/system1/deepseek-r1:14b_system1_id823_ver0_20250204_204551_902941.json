    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but it might relate to systemic issues or access to resources, though that's more of a socioeconomic factor.\n\nArrested three times with convictions. That's significant because prior convictions are strong predictors of future offenses. Three arrests and convictions suggest a pattern, which is concerning.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless they're extremes, but I don't see an issue here.\n\nMarried and living with her spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a protective factor, indicating stability, but it depends on the quality of the relationship and other factors like substance use or mental health.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is a risk factor; lower education can correlate with higher recidivism. However, she has held one job during the year, which shows some employability and responsibility.\n\nUsed drugs recently\u2014marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent, is a red flag for potential criminal behavior, though marijuana alone might be less severe than other substances.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer her up. Depression or mood disorders can increase risk of reoffending due to impaired judgment and coping mechanisms.\n\nLived with non-biological parents in a household of six as a child. This could indicate instability or lack of strong support systems early on, which might contribute to behavioral issues later.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and community, but it's context-dependent.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are major red flags. Recent drug use adds to the risk. The fact that she's felt depressed recently is another concern. While being married and employed are positive factors, they might not outweigh the negatives. Her living situation as a child and educational status could also contribute.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the prior convictions and recent substance use, but I'm not entirely certain without more context on her support systems or specific offense history.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
