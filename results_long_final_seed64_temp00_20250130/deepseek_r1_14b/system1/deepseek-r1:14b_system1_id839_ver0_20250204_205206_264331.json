    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not necessarily a red flag on its own. Being male might be a factor since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's just one aspect.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race plays into risk assessment models here; it's more about behavior and background rather than demographics.\n\nArrested once and convicted. That's concerning because prior convictions can indicate a pattern or at least a history of engaging in criminal activity. The fact that he was arrested and then convicted suggests he might have a tendency to reoffend, though it's just one instance.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless they relate to physical altercations, but there's no info suggesting that here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can be a factor; those who live with others might have more support systems in place, but if he's not living alone, maybe it's due to supervision or other reasons. Not sure how significant this is.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence risk factors, as higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Without being in school, there might be fewer positive influences and more time for potential criminal activity.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor because it can lead to idleness and opportunities for crime. Lack of steady employment might mean he's struggling financially and could turn to illegal activities.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major red flag. Both drugs are associated with criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like unemployment or prior convictions.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression can contribute to risky behaviors, including criminal activity. If he's struggling emotionally, it might make him more likely to act out.\n\nGrowing up in a rural household of size 4 with his biological mother. Family environment can influence behavior; however, without knowing specifics about the family dynamics or support systems, it's hard to assess. Rural areas might have different crime rates and access to resources.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious or moral compass, which could be a risk factor if religion is seen as a protective element in some assessments.\n\nPutting this all together: prior conviction, unemployment, drug use, mental health struggles, and possible lack of support systems point towards higher risk. However, it's not an absolute certainty, so confidence isn't 100%. Maybe around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
