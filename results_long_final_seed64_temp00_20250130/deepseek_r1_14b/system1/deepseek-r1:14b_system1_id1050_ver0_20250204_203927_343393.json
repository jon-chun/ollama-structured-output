    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors. Hispanic ethnicity isn't inherently a risk factor, so that might not play a big role here.\n\nHe has two arrests and one conviction. Convictions are significant because they indicate past criminal behavior, which could be a red flag for future offenses. The fact that he's been arrested twice suggests some pattern of getting into trouble with the law.\n\nLooking at his living situation: he lives alone, hasn't been married, and doesn't have children mentioned. Living alone might mean less support system, which can be a risk factor if he lacks social connections to keep him on track.\n\nEducation-wise, no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked with higher rates of criminal behavior because there are fewer opportunities and resources available. This could contribute to ongoing issues.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. That seems like he might be struggling to maintain steady employment, which can indicate instability. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which sometimes correlates with criminal activity as a means of income.\n\nDrug use is another major factor. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and more recently has felt down in the dumps, even feeling so low that nothing cheered him up. Substance abuse is a strong indicator for potential recidivism because drugs can impair judgment and increase impulsive behavior.\n\nHis background includes living with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but without more info on family dynamics or community support, it's hard to say how much this contributes. However, growing up in a large household might indicate some level of chaos or lack of structure.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. This could be a positive factor if it provides him with a strong support system or sense of purpose, but it might also lead to different coping mechanisms that aren't clear here.\n\nPutting this all together: past convictions, recent drug use, unemployment issues, lack of education, and living alone are significant risk factors. These elements suggest potential instability and higher likelihood of future criminal behavior. However, without more detailed information on his support networks or current mental health beyond the recent low mood, it's a bit uncertain.\n\nI'd say there's a moderate to high risk here. Maybe around 60-70% confidence that he could be at high risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
