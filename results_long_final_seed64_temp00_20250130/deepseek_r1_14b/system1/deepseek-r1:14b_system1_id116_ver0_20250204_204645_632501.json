    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have less stability and more impulsive behavior. But since he's just turned 18, it's a bit early to make assumptions without more context.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race is a significant factor here unless there are known biases in the data used for risk assessments, which I should be cautious about.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. It might suggest that the case was dismissed or he wasn't found guilty, which is positive.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 170 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly relate to criminal risk unless they're used for other purposes like employment in certain roles, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, especially if he's attending college. Being unmarried is common at this age. It might indicate independence but doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally seen as protective against criminal behavior. Being in college suggests he's focused on his future, which could lower risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is another positive factor; having a steady job can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Marijuana use might be a concern, but it depends on frequency and context. Past drug use could indicate potential for future issues, but not necessarily high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health is important; no recent depression is positive, though other mental health issues could still exist.\n\nLived with his biological dad in a household of 5 in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment might expose him to more crime and negative influences, but living with both parents (or at least the father) could provide some stability. However, larger households can sometimes mean less individual attention and more potential for conflict.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This is a theological belief and generally shouldn't be a factor in risk assessment unless it's part of a broader indicator like lack of social support or involvement in certain communities.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some positive factors like education, employment, and no current mental health issues. The arrest without conviction might not be too concerning if it was for something minor. Drug use is present but not severe based on the info given. His living situation and background are mixed\u2014urban areas can have higher crime rates, but he's in college now.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because of his educational pursuits, employment, and lack of a conviction. The arrest might be a slight concern, but without more details, it's hard to say. Drug use is present but not necessarily severe enough to indicate high risk on its own.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
