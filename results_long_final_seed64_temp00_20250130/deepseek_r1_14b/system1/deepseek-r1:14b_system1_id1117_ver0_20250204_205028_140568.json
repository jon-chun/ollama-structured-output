    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's a generalization and can vary widely.\n\nRace is Black. While race isn't a direct indicator, systemic issues and biases in the criminal justice system could play a role, potentially affecting outcomes. However, without specific data on how this affects risk assessment, it's tricky to assign weight here.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can be a sign of potential future offenses, even without convictions. The lack of convictions might suggest he hasn't been found guilty yet, which could mean lower immediate risk, but past arrests are still concerning.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll set those aside.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being unmarried isn't a direct indicator, but living alone might mean fewer social supports, potentially increasing risk factors if he's isolated.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked to higher recidivism rates because education can be a protective factor against crime. Without education, it's harder to find stable employment, which ties into the next point.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor. Lack of steady income can lead to financial strain and may push someone towards criminal activity as a means of survival or due to lack of alternatives.\n\nDrug use: cocaine in the past four years. Cocaine use is associated with higher rates of criminal behavior, both as a crime itself (if selling) and because drug use can impair judgment and increase impulsivity. Recent use within the past month indicates ongoing issues.\n\nMental health: feels down in the dumps some days, nothing cheered him up. Depression or other mental health issues can contribute to risk factors by affecting decision-making and increasing stress, which might lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but it's not deterministic. Family dynamics could play a role if there were issues, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious involvement might be a risk factor since some studies show religion can be protective against criminal behavior through community support and moral frameworks.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors that stand out are unemployment, drug use, lack of education, past arrests, mental health issues, and living alone without strong social supports. These are significant red flags. However, no convictions might slightly lower the risk, but the other factors still point towards high risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with moderate confidence because while there are several concerning factors, some variables like lack of prior conviction could indicate he hasn't acted on these risks yet. But the combination is strong enough to warrant caution.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
