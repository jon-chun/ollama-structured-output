    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is quite young, and being male can be a factor since males generally commit more crimes than females. His race might influence certain societal factors or biases, but I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential risk because they show past criminal behavior. The fact that he's been convicted means there was a formal finding of guilt, which is more serious than just an arrest.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how much this affects risk assessment. Maybe taller individuals might have different profiles, but I don't see a direct link here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Not being married at 18 isn't unusual, but it's something to note.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked with higher crime rates because education can be a protective factor against delinquency. Without a diploma, he might have fewer employment opportunities.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year. That shows some level of work ethic, but it's also possible that he's trying to make ends meet without much stability. It could indicate economic stress or instability.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use is common and while not as severe as other drugs, any drug use can be a red flag, especially if combined with other risk factors. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean he's not struggling mentally at the moment.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Urban areas tend to have higher crime rates, so that's a factor. Family structure can influence behavior; living with both parents is often protective, but here it's just mom and two others.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate strong religious beliefs, which might be a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: He has arrests and convictions, which are significant. His lack of education and living alone are concerning. Urban residence adds another layer. However, his employment history and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. I'm leaning towards high risk because the criminal history is strong, but I'm not entirely certain without more context.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
