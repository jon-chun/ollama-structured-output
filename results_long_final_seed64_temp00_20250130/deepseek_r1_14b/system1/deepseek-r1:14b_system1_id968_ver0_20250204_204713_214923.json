    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a slight point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here; it's more about behavior and background. So maybe neutral on this one.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without convictions. However, no convictions might suggest he hasn't been proven guilty yet, which could lower the risk a bit.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so probably not relevant to risk assessment unless it's related to physical crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, potentially increasing risk factors if he lacks community ties. But being unmarried is common at his age, so maybe not a major factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is generally protective against crime, as it provides better opportunities and reduces stressors that can lead to criminal behavior. So this might lower the risk.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year. Employment is another positive indicator; having steady work can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity due to financial stability.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse, especially cocaine which is more associated with violent crime, could be a significant red flag. This might indicate higher risk as drug use often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so no depression here is positive, but other factors like substance use still matter.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is generally protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences. So this could be a mixed factor\u2014positive for family support but negative for environment.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk, as religion often provides a moral framework. But it's not a direct indicator, so maybe less impact here.\n\nPutting it all together: The positive factors include education, employment, and no depression. Negative factors are past arrests, drug use, living alone, and urban upbringing. The drug use is particularly concerning because it's linked to higher criminal behavior. However, the lack of convictions might indicate he hasn't acted on those tendencies yet.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk. He has some protective factors but also significant warning signs, especially regarding substance abuse and past arrests without convictions. So I'd say \"YES\" for high risk with maybe 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
