    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black female. Age might be relevant because younger individuals could have less stability, but being 22 isn't particularly young in terms of criminal behavior. Her race might not directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues, which I shouldn't consider here without more context.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes correlate with higher risk, especially if they're recent or multiple. However, no conviction could mean she didn't engage in serious behavior that led to a charge.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless there's an issue related to physical size affecting interactions, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might reduce some support systems but doesn't inherently increase risk. Marital status alone isn't a strong indicator either.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism rates if she's employed, which she is\u2014she's held three jobs this year. Stable employment is generally a positive factor that might reduce risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is good. However, she has experienced some depression recently, feeling down and unable to be cheered up at times. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk if not managed properly, but her recent drug abstinence is a plus.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 2 isn't particularly telling unless there were issues within that home, which aren't mentioned here. She considers God's role in her life, indicating possible strong beliefs, which might provide support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: she has some factors like an arrest, but no conviction, stable employment, education, and a supportive belief system. The mental health issue is a concern, but without more severe indicators, the overall risk doesn't seem extremely high. So I'd say \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 2. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
