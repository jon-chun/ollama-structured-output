    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is young but not extremely so. Younger individuals can be more impulsive, but it's a common age for criminal behavior as well.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct factor in risk assessment, unless there are underlying issues related to systemic factors, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nArrest and conviction history: he's been arrested twice and convicted. That definitely increases the risk because prior convictions can indicate a pattern of\u8fdd\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'4\" and 190 lbs. While height might make someone more intimidating, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it's related to physical altercations or crimes where size is a factor.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Being single isn't a risk factor on its own, but living alone could mean less supervision and support, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, though it's not a direct cause. However, without further info on his current job stability or other factors, it's hard to say.\n\nEmployment history: held 3 jobs in the past year. This shows he's trying to maintain employment, which is generally a positive sign. Steady work can reduce the incentive for criminal activity.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior, especially when under the influence or seeking drugs.\n\nMental health: no depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but since he's not currently depressed, that's a mitigating factor.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with 5 people. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and living in a larger household might mean more exposure to negative influences or less parental supervision.\n\nSpirituality: believes God has a role in his life. Spirituality can sometimes be protective, but it's not always the case. It depends on how he integrates his beliefs into his actions.\n\nPutting this all together, the key factors are prior convictions and recent drug use. These two points strongly indicate higher risk. While other factors like employment and lack of depression are positive, they might not outweigh the negatives. The arrest history is particularly concerning because it shows a pattern that could lead to future offenses.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
