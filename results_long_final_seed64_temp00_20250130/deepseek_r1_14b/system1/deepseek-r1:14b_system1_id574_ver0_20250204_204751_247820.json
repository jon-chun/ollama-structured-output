    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might play a role. However, without more context on that, it's hard to assess.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk factor, especially if they're recent or multiple. A single arrest might not be too concerning unless there are other issues.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here. Unmarried and living alone\u2014those factors aren't directly linked to criminal behavior, though living alone could mean less supervision, but again, not a strong indicator.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college suggests she's educationally engaged, which is usually a protective factor against crime. No jobs during the year might indicate underemployment or lack of structure, which can be a risk if combined with other factors like substance use.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance use is definitely a red flag for potential criminal behavior, especially if it's ongoing. Cocaine is more concerning than marijuana in terms of associated crimes.\n\nNo depression reported recently, so mental health isn't an immediate issue here. Family background: lived with biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with parents might provide some stability.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life\u2014spirituality is often seen as protective against criminal behavior, so that could be a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a couple of risk factors (drug use, arrest) and several protective factors (education, spirituality). The single arrest isn't too concerning if there's no conviction. Her current situation might suggest moderate risk rather than high. However, the drug use is significant because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"NO\" for high risk but not entirely confident. Maybe around 60-70% confidence? But since I need to choose YES or NO, and considering her protective factors might outweigh the risks, perhaps it's safer to say NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
