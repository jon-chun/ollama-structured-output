    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22, which is relatively young but not a minor. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but that's just one factor.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, so I'll set that aside unless other factors tie into it.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, especially without a conviction, which might indicate he wasn't found guilty or the charges were dropped.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 185 lbs. These stats don't directly correlate with criminal risk unless they're part of other factors like physical altercations, but there's no info on that here.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Being single isn't a red flag, but living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a minor factor.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not in college. Education level can sometimes relate to opportunities and stability, but without more context, it's hard to say. He has held one job during the year, so he's employed, which is generally a positive sign as employment can reduce criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so this absence could lower his overall risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed might mean less stress or mental health issues that could lead to impulsive actions.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 5. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family stability is usually protective. Having both parents around might mitigate some risks, though the exact impact depends on other factors like family dynamics.\n\nHe considers God's role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, as they might deter someone from engaging in risky behavior due to moral beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: He has an arrest but no conviction, which is somewhat concerning but not definitive. No drug use or depression is positive. Employment and living with parents could indicate stability. The fact that he's employed and hasn't used drugs recently are strong positives. However, the arrest might still be a point of concern.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because most factors don't strongly suggest high risk. His stable background, employment, and absence of substance use/depression seem to outweigh the arrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
