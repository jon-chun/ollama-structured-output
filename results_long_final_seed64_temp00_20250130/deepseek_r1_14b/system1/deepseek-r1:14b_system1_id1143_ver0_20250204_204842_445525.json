    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age-wise, 21 isn't particularly young or old in terms of criminal behavior, but being Hispanic might be a factor depending on the context, though I don't have data on that here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, an arrest could still signal some level of risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 130 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly impact risk unless they relate to past behavior or other factors, which isn't the case here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, potentially increasing risk if he's isolated. No spouse could also be a factor in some assessments, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels are often correlated with higher crime rates. This is a significant red flag because education can influence opportunities and behavior.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having steady employment can be protective, but only holding one job might indicate limited stability if that job isn't secure or if he's recently employed.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a strong indicator of potential risk, especially for recidivism or other criminal behavior. Cocaine is particularly concerning as it's more associated with violent crime.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health can be a factor, but since he's not depressed now, this might lower the risk slightly, though past mental health issues could still matter.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household of seven. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so that's a negative. However, living with both parents can be protective, but the large household size might mean more complexity or potential for influence from others.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious support, which could be a risk factor if religion is seen as protective in some contexts.\n\nPutting it all together: The significant factors are past arrest, no diploma, drug use, urban upbringing, and living alone. These point towards higher risk. However, he's employed and hasn't shown signs of depression recently, which might slightly mitigate the risk but not enough to outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
