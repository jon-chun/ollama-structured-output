    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a point to consider.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here, but it's noted. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, especially if there was no conviction, which might suggest the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 204 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it's related to certain types of crimes, but in this case, it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can be a factor; not living alone might mean he has more support or supervision, which could lower risk. However, being unmarried at 20 isn't unusual.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, as education is seen as a protective factor against delinquency. But having a GED shows some level of basic education.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Multiple jobs might indicate instability or perhaps he's trying to make ends meet, which could be a sign of financial stress but not necessarily criminal behavior. Alternatively, it might show responsibility and work ethic.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, as drugs can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities to obtain them or commit crimes under their influence.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so no depression in the last month is a good sign.\n\nFamily background: He lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and living in a large household might indicate a chaotic environment, which could be a risk factor. However, he's lived with his mother, which might provide some stability.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious involvement or belief can sometimes correlate with higher risk because religion is often seen as a protective factor against crime. But this isn't always the case and varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors here are his arrest history, drug use, urban upbringing, and lack of college enrollment. While he has a GED and multiple jobs, which are positive signs, the arrest and drug use are concerning. His age is also a factor as younger individuals might be more impulsive. However, without a conviction, it's hard to gauge the severity of his past behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because while there are several factors that could indicate potential for future issues, they aren't overwhelmingly severe. The confidence level would probably be around 60-70%, as there are both positive and negative indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
