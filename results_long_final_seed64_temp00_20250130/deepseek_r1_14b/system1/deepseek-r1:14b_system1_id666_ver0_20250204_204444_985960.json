    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but still an adult. Young adults can be more impulsive, so that might be a slight red flag.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, men commit most crimes, so that's another point to consider.\n\nRace is White. I don't think race itself should influence risk assessment unless there are underlying factors related to systemic issues or past behavior tied to it, but in this case, it doesn't seem relevant beyond the demographic info.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, especially if not handled properly. A conviction shows he's gone through the system before, which might mean a higher likelihood of repeating offenses.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it's related to specific crimes like theft or violence, but there's no info on that here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being unmarried isn't necessarily a risk factor, but living alone could mean less supervision and support, which might increase the chance of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nEnrolled in school currently but hasn't held any jobs during the year. Lack of employment can be a risk factor because it may indicate idleness or lack of structure, which can lead to criminal activity. However, being enrolled in school is positive and could counterbalance that.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant red flag for recidivism. Both drugs are illegal, and their use can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, leading to more criminal behavior.\n\nNo reported depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but since he's not depressed now, that might lower the risk slightly, though other factors still apply.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Family stability is usually protective against delinquency, so having grown up with both parents could be a mitigating factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but without more info on his environment, it's hard to say.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a deterrent from criminal behavior, though this varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: He has arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators. His drug use is concerning. However, he's in school, which might mean he's trying to stay on the right path. The fact that he's living alone without a job could be a risk factor. His background with stable parents might help, but overall, the negative factors seem to outweigh the positives.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the arrests, convictions, and drug use, despite some mitigating factors like being in school.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
