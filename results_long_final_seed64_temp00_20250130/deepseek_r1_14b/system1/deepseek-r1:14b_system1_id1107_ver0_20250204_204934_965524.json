    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but still an adult. Younger adults can sometimes be more impulsive, so that might be a slight red flag.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure if ethnicity alone is a significant factor here, but it's noted.\n\nArrested twice without convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, even without convictions. It shows he has come into contact with the law before, which could mean higher risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and 280 lbs. Obesity might be a factor in terms of health risks or perhaps social challenges, but I'm not sure how directly it relates to criminal behavior.\n\nMarried and living with spouse. Marriage is often seen as a protective factor because it can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. So this might actually lower his risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can be linked to higher crime rates because limited education may limit job opportunities and increase stress. This is definitely a concern.\n\nHeld 5 jobs in a year. Job hopping could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might correlate with financial strain and potential for criminal behavior. However, it's not a direct indicator but something to consider.\n\nUsed drugs (cocaine) in the past four years. Cocaine use is a significant factor because substance abuse often correlates with higher crime rates, especially if he's involved in drug-related offenses or crimes to support his habit.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is important; absence of depression might reduce risk, but other factors could still be at play.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household size of 7. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's a factor. Living with both parents might provide some stability, but the large household size could mean more complexity or potential for negative influences.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs are generally protective factors as they can deter individuals from engaging in criminal behavior due to moral beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: He has several risk factors like arrests, drug use, job instability, and low education. Protective factors include being married, living with spouse, and religious beliefs. The presence of both parents might help but the urban setting could be a negative influence. Overall, I'm leaning towards high risk because the number of risk factors outweighs the protective ones.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
