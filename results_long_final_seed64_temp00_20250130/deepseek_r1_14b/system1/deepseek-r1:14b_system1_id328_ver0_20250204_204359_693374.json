    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though it varies.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest that the charges were dropped or she was acquitted, which could be a positive sign. However, an arrest itself is still a risk factor to consider.\n\nHer living situation: she's living alone and hasn't been married. Living alone might indicate independence, but it can also mean less support in times of stress. No prior marriage doesn't necessarily contribute much here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education is sometimes linked to lower recidivism rates, so not being enrolled might be slightly concerning.\n\nEmployment: she's held 3 jobs in the past year. Multiple job changes could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor if it suggests financial stress or other issues.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in four years. That's positive and reduces risk, as drug involvement often correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nMental health: she felt down in the dumps for most of the past month. Depression or mood disorders can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to stressors and lack of coping mechanisms.\n\nFamily background: grew up with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Urban settings might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics are complex. Being raised in such an environment could be a risk factor if there's a history of criminal behavior or substance abuse in the family.\n\nReligious beliefs: she believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against reoffending, but it depends on how that belief influences her actions and support systems.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors are mixed. Positive aspects include no drug use, employment history, and possible religious beliefs. Negative factors include an arrest record, potential family background issues, mental health struggles, and job instability. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk rather than high because while there are several concerning elements, some positive factors mitigate that. However, without more specific details on the nature of her arrest or family history, it's hard to be certain.\n\nSo, I would say \"YES\" for high risk with maybe 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
