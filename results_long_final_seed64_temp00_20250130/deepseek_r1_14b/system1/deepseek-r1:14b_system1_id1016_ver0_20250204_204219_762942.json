    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age might be a factor since younger individuals could be more impulsive, but being 18 isn't necessarily high risk unless other factors are present. Race alone shouldn't influence risk assessment, so I'll set that aside.\n\nShe's been arrested three times without any convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even if there were no convictions. The fact that she hasn't been convicted might suggest that the charges didn't hold up, but multiple arrests could still be a red flag.\n\nHer living situation is alone, which might mean less support or supervision, potentially increasing risk. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which could indicate limited education and possibly lower employability, another risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job during the year, so she has some work history, which is somewhat positive but not enough to outweigh other negatives. No drug use in four years is good, but past substance abuse isn't mentioned, so maybe that's a mitigating factor. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean lower mental health issues currently.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six, which could indicate a lack of parental control or exposure to negative influences, potentially increasing risk. Her belief that God has something to do with her personal events is more about her coping mechanism and doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests without convictions, limited education, living alone, and past household size might point towards higher risk. However, she's employed, hasn't used drugs recently, and no depression symptoms. The confidence level isn't extremely high but leans towards yes due to the arrest history and other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
