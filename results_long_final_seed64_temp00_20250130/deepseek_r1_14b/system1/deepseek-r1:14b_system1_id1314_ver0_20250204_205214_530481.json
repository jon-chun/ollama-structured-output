    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability, but being 21 isn't necessarily high risk. Race alone shouldn't influence risk assessment, so I'll set that aside unless other factors tie into it.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he was either innocent or didn't face charges due to legal reasons. However, arrests can still be a red flag because they might indicate potential for future issues. But since there are no convictions, the immediate risk from this might be lower.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs. Physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless they're used in crimes like burglary or assault, but without more info, I can't link his size to higher risk.\n\nLiving alone at 21 isn't unusual, especially if he's independent. However, living alone might mean less social support, which could be a factor, but it's not a direct indicator of risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, as higher education is associated with lower crime rates. But since he has a diploma, that's a positive sign.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Steady employment is generally a good indicator of stability and lower risk. Having a job suggests responsibility and provides an income, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression in the past month are strong positives. Substance abuse is a major factor in crime, so his sobriety is a plus. Lack of depression also reduces stress-related crimes.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. Larger families might have different dynamics; sometimes they provide more support but could also mean higher exposure to negative influences. Without knowing the family environment, it's hard to assess, but I'll consider it as a neutral factor unless other info suggests otherwise.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective factors, often leading to better decision-making and lower involvement in criminal activities.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some positive factors like employment, education, no drug use, and spiritual beliefs. The arrest history is a concern but without convictions, it's less severe. His living situation and family size don't add significant risk. Overall, the positives seem to outweigh the negatives, so I'm leaning towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
