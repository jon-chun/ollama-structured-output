    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age-wise, 21 is still relatively young, but being Hispanic might be a factor depending on the context of crime statistics in certain areas. However, without specific data linking this to higher risk, I'm not sure it's a significant indicator here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future offenses, but no convictions mean he hasn't been proven guilty yet. This might slightly increase his risk but isn't definitive.\n\nHis build is 5'10\" and 202 lbs. I don't see how height or weight directly correlates with criminal behavior unless it's related to certain types of crimes, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because there are fewer people around to monitor behavior, but he's currently not doing so. Not being married might mean different responsibilities or support systems in place.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is generally seen as a protective factor against crime. Being in college suggests he's engaged in education, which could lower his risk.\n\nHe held four jobs in the past year. Multiple job changes can sometimes indicate instability, but it might also show adaptability and willingness to work. It's a bit of a mixed signal, but I lean towards positive since having multiple jobs might mean he's trying to establish himself.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, can be a risk factor for criminal behavior, particularly if it's part of a pattern or associated with other illegal activities. However, without more context on usage frequency or other drug involvement, this is moderate concern.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health is crucial; no depression here might reduce his risk as mental issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior when untreated.\n\nHe lived with adoptive parents in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can have higher crime rates, but being part of a larger family might provide support and reduce individual risk. The fact that he was raised by adoptive parents doesn't inherently indicate risk unless there were issues within the family.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs are often protective factors as they can provide a sense of purpose and community, which may deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, educated, employed, not convicted despite arrests, and has some positive influences like religion and education. The arrest history and drug use are concerns but not severe enough on their own. His living situation and family background might mitigate some risks. Overall, I'm leaning towards low risk because the protective factors seem to outweigh the negative ones.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
