    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher crime rates among males, but that's a broad generalization.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a risk factor here; it's more about other variables like socioeconomic status or community factors.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, but lack of convictions might suggest he hasn't been serious enough to get convicted, which could be a positive sign.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so probably not relevant unless there's something specific about his build related to criminal activity, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision, but being unmarried at 18 isn't unusual. It could indicate independence, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nEnrolled in school currently. Education is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior, so this is positive.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment can be a strong indicator of stability and lower risk, so that's another positive point.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use, especially harder drugs like cocaine, can correlate with higher criminal risk. Recurrent drug use might indicate potential for substance-related crimes or impaired judgment leading to\u8fdd\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is a factor; absence of depression here could mean lower risk in that area.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban household of size 4. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior. However, he's currently living alone, so maybe family support isn't as present now.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs are often associated with lower criminality, as they provide a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some positive factors like being enrolled in school, employed, no depression, and religious beliefs. However, the drug use is a concern, especially cocaine, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors. The two arrests without convictions might indicate some level of involvement but not severe enough for a conviction yet.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because while there are positive factors, the drug use and past arrests could still pose significant risks. However, I'm not certain if these factors alone would classify him as high risk or just moderate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
