    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female, Hispanic. Age is quite young, but being Hispanic might not necessarily be a significant risk factor on its own unless there are other cultural or socioeconomic considerations.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's hard to gauge the severity of her past behavior.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'5\" and 174 lbs. Weight alone isn't typically a direct risk factor unless it relates to health issues or other behaviors, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at her age might mean she has less support from family, which could be a risk factor if she struggles with independence. However, not being married isn't inherently risky.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can correlate with higher risks of criminal behavior or other issues because limited education often leads to fewer job opportunities and higher stress.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a job is generally a positive indicator, showing responsibility, but only holding one might suggest instability if she hasn't had more consistent employment history.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. Marijuana is often considered less severe than other drugs, but any drug use could indicate potential for substance-related crimes or impaired judgment.\n\nIn the past month, she's felt down so much that nothing cheered her up. Depression symptoms are significant because they can lead to impulsive behavior, substance abuse, or other risky actions as a coping mechanism.\n\nShe lived with non-biological parents in an urban area household of size 4. Growing up in such an environment might indicate instability or lack of strong family support, which could contribute to higher risk factors.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal events. This might suggest a lack of religious or spiritual support, which can sometimes be a factor in risky behavior if she's not connected to a supportive community.\n\nPutting it all together: She has several moderate risk factors\u2014drug use, depression symptoms, limited education, living alone, and past arrest. However, the absence of a conviction and having held a job somewhat mitigate these risks. The overall picture isn't extremely high risk but does suggest some concerns that could warrant monitoring.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
