    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 20 years old. Young adults are often in a transitional phase, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not definitive.\n\nRace: He identifies as Black. While race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk, systemic factors might play a role, but I should be cautious about overgeneralizing.\n\nArrest history: He was arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, the fact that he was arrested at all is a red flag.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 185 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly impact risk unless they relate to other factors like employment or health, which isn't the case here.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, potentially increasing risk if he lacks social networks.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher risk, but again, it's not direct.\n\nEmployment: Held 4 jobs in the year. Multiple jobs could indicate instability or perhaps financial stress, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is often linked to higher criminal justice involvement and other risks.\n\nMental health: No depression symptoms in the past month. Positive indicator, as mental health issues can increase risk if left untreated.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of 5. Large family size might indicate potential for social or economic challenges, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nSpirituality: Believes God has a role in his life. Spirituality can be protective, reducing risk by providing coping mechanisms and support.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together. The arrest is significant because even without conviction, it could signal past behavior that might recur. Drug use adds another layer of concern. However, he's employed, educated, and not showing signs of mental health issues. His living situation and spirituality might mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk assessment. There are several factors pointing towards potential issues (arrest, drug use), but also positive aspects that could reduce overall risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
