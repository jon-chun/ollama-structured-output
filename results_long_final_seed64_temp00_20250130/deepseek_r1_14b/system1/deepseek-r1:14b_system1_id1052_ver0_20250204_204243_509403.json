    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. Hispanic ethnicity isn't inherently a risk factor, so that doesn't add much.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, the fact that he was arrested might still be a concern.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 199 lbs. I'm not sure if body type correlates with criminal behavior, so maybe this isn't significant on its own.\n\nMarital status is single, living alone. Not married could mean fewer responsibilities, but living alone might indicate less social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment often correlates with higher risk of criminal behavior because it can limit job opportunities and increase stress.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the past year. That shows some initiative but might also indicate instability if he's switching jobs frequently without long-term commitment.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, especially illegal drugs, is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. Even though it's just marijuana, any drug use can be indicative of potential issues.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is important; absence of depression might lower the risk, but other mental health factors could still be present.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in a household of 5. Large family size might indicate possible lack of supervision or higher stress, which can contribute to delinquency.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This shows strong religious beliefs, which can sometimes act as a protective factor against criminal behavior by providing a sense of purpose and accountability.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors seem to be the arrest, lack of education, unemployment instability, drug use, and family background. These are moderate risk indicators. However, his religious beliefs might mitigate some of that risk. I'm leaning towards a lower confidence level because while there are several red flags, they aren't extremely severe, and positive factors like religion could reduce the likelihood.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
