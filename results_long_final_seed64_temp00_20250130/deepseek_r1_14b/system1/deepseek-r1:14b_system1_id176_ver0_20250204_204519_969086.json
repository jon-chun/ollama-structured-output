    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but still an adult. Younger adults can sometimes be more impulsive, but that's not always a bad sign. Being male might be relevant because some studies show higher crime rates among men, though that's a broad generalization.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that race can be a factor in risk assessments, often due to systemic issues leading to overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. But it's important not to let that bias influence the assessment without considering other factors.\n\nArrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly relevant unless they relate to physical altercations or specific types of crimes, but I don't see that information here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive. Being unmarried at 19 isn't unusual.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level can be an indicator; lower education is sometimes linked with higher crime rates, though this varies widely.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is definitely a risk factor because financial stress and lack of purpose can drive criminal behavior. Chronic unemployment is concerning.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use itself might not be as severe as other drugs, but any drug use could indicate substance abuse issues, which often co-occur with criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is a factor; absence of depression here doesn't negate other potential mental health issues, though.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with his biological mother and three others. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but it's more about individual circumstances than just location. Family dynamics might play a role, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be both protective (providing support) and sometimes linked with certain types of crimes if misinterpreted, though that's rare.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. Unemployment and lack of education add to that risk. Drug use is another point against him. His age might slightly mitigate since he's still developing, but 19 is quite old for such a criminal history. Race is a factor in the context of systemic issues but shouldn't be the sole determinant.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the arrest and conviction history, unemployment, and drug use. However, without more detailed information on his current circumstances or support systems, it's hard to be certain. Maybe I'd rate confidence around 70-80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
