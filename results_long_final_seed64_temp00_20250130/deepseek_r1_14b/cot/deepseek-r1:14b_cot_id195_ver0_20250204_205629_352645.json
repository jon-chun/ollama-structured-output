    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be maturing and making impulsive decisions. So that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates due to systemic issues, it's not the strongest factor here. I'll consider this low impact.\n\nArrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are significant because they indicate a pattern of behavior. Conviction adds weight too, showing he went through the system before. That's high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nMarried and living with spouse is positive. Stable relationships can reduce recidivism, making this a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education can lower the chance of reoffending. However, being out of school might mean he's not seeking further education, so I'll rate it as low.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year. Employment is generally good, providing stability and income. But having only held one job might indicate limited opportunities or recent employment. Medium here.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. This could impair judgment and lead to further issues. High impact.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently. Mental health is crucial; absence of depression is positive but might not account for other potential mental health issues. Low impact.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas may have higher crime rates. This is a medium factor.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism. That's positive, so low risk here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are multiple arrests, drug use, and stable employment. The positives include being married, employed, educated, and having spiritual beliefs. Overall, the risks seem to outweigh protective factors, leading me to predict a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_22\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are often at a higher risk for recidivism as they may still be in a developmental stage and more prone to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"hispanic_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism, though systemic factors can influence outcomes.\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_conviction\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction indicate a history of problematic behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight are generally not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"married_living_with_spouse\", \"medium\", \"Marriage and living with a spouse can be protective factors, but they do not guarantee against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_in_college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, though lack of further education may indicate limited opportunities or motivation.\"),\n    (\"employed_one_job_year\", \"medium\", \"Employment can be a protective factor, but the fact that he has only held one job in the past year might suggest limited stability or opportunity\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use_marijuana\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana) is a significant risk factor as it may impair judgment and contribute to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"no_depression_past_month\", \"low\", \"Lack of depression symptoms in the past month is generally positive, though other mental health issues could still be factors\"),\n    (\"grew_up_with_both_parents_urban_area\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both biological parents can provide stability, but urban environments may have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs_god_role\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can serve as a protective factor, though their impact on recidivism is generally considered moderate.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
