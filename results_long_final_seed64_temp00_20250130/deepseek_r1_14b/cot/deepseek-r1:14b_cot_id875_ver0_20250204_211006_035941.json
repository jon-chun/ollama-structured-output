    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low risk because younger adults might be more impulsive but also have higher potential for change.\n\nHe's male, and gender can be a medium risk since males generally have higher recidivism rates than females.\n\nArrested once without conviction: this is low risk. The lack of a conviction suggests he may not have a strong criminal history yet.\n\nWhite race is considered low risk in many studies, though I should note that systemic factors might influence this.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so no significant impact on recidivism here\u2014low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone: being single and alone can be both a risk (lack of support) and protective factor (independence). I'll lean towards low risk but acknowledge it's a bit neutral.\n\nGED with no college enrollment: education is a medium risk. Lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism, so this could be a moderate concern.\n\nEmployed at two jobs shows responsibility\u2014low risk as stable employment is protective against reoffending.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years: substance abuse is a high risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior and hinder rehabilitation.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently: mental health stability is low risk, which is positive.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area of size 6: family structure is protective, so low risk. Urban areas might have more challenges, but the presence of supportive parents could mitigate that.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life: strong religious beliefs are a protective factor\u2014low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, most are low or medium except drug use, which is high. However, the positive aspects like employment and family background may balance this. I'm uncertain but leaning towards predicting no recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; younger individuals may have higher risk due to immaturity but also potential for change\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender generally has a higher association with recidivism rates compared to female\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history and possible first-time offense\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White race is generally associated with lower recidivism rates in some studies, though context matters\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; living alone may indicate independence but could also mean lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED without college enrollment may suggest limited educational attainment, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs shows responsibility and stability, which are protective factors\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use in the past four years indicates potential substance abuse issues linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month suggests stable mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both biological parents, which is a protective factor against delinquency\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Strong religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
