    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nRace might influence due to systemic issues, but without specific data on bias, it's hard to assign high weight here. Maybe low impact.\n\nArrest history: two arrests without convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, so this is a medium factor.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED and not enrolled. Low education correlates with higher recidivism, making this a high factor.\n\nEmployment status: Unemployed for the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator, so high here.\n\nDrug use: Cocaine in past four years. Recent drug use increases risk, so medium.\n\nMental health: Feelings of depression recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in an urban household of size 4. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics alone aren't enough for high weight; maybe low.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't see God's role. Lack of religious involvement is sometimes linked to higher risk, but not a primary factor here\u2014low impact.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicators are education and employment status (both high), arrest history (medium), drug use and mental health (medium each). The low factors might not contribute as much but still add up. Overall, the combination suggests a moderate to high risk. I'll predict YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"21 years old is relatively young and may be more impulsive or at higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but without specific data on bias in the justice system, it's a low factor\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent cocaine use in the past four years increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression recently can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban household of size 4 may have some impact but is not a primary factor\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's role personally may have minimal impact on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 161 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
