    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly low. However, younger adults can be more impulsive, so that might weigh as a medium factor.\n\nShe's female, and generally, women have lower recidivism rates than men, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct indicator of recidivism, so I'll consider it low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrest history: 3 arrests with convictions. Multiple arrests are significant predictors, so that's high.\n\nConviction history is also strong; having been convicted multiple times increases the likelihood of rearrest, making this another high factor.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low here.\n\nMarital status: never married. Unmarried individuals might have different support systems, but it's not a direct indicator, so medium if considering social support factors.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, which might be a slight risk factor, so medium.\n\nEducation level: no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism due to fewer opportunities, making this high.\n\nEmployment history: held 3 jobs in the year. Steady employment can be protective, but frequent job changes might indicate instability, so medium.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential criminal activity, so high.\n\nMental health: not felt depressed recently. No current mental health issues reported, which is positive, so low.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of size 3. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info, it's medium.\n\nReligious belief: considers God's role in her life. Some studies suggest religion can be protective against recidivism, so this might lower the risk, making it low.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the high points are arrest history, convictions, education level, and drug use. These strong indicators likely outweigh others. However, employment and lack of depression are positive signs. Overall, the risk seems moderate to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults may be more impulsive\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a direct indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"3 arrests with convictions indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Convictions are strong predictors of rearrest\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"No correlation between physical stats and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may affect social support\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate less supervision\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED linked to higher risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"3 jobs in a year suggests some stability but frequent changes\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with mother; family dynamics can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may offer protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
