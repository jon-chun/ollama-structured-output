    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly low. However, being in one's twenties can still be a time when individuals are more likely to engage in risky behavior, so I'll consider it medium.\n\nShe's female, and generally, women have lower recidivism rates than men. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nRace might influence outcomes due to systemic factors, but without specific data on bias here, it's hard to assign a high weight. Maybe medium, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nArrest history: two arrests with convictions. Convictions are significant predictors, so this is definitely a high factor.\n\nEducation level is a high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lower education can correlate with higher recidivism, so that's medium.\n\nEmployment: she's held five jobs in the year. Stable employment is good, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. So I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so high here.\n\nNo history of depression recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not depressed now, it's low.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, increasing risk. So medium.\n\nFamily background: grew up in a household of size 3. Not sure about the impact here; maybe low or medium.\n\nReligious beliefs (God's role) can sometimes be protective, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are arrest history and drug use. The moderate ones include age, race, education, living alone, and family background. The lows are female, employment, mental health, and religion.\n\nConsidering these, the risk is moderately high but not extremely so. I'll predict a YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may be more likely to engage in risky behavior\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"female, which generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White; race can influence outcomes but requires careful consideration of systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"two arrests with convictions, indicating a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma without college enrollment; lower education may correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"held five jobs in the year; stable employment can be protective but frequent changes may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not felt depressed over the past month; absence of recent mental health issues reduces risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"currently living alone; lack of social support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"medium\", \"grew up in a household of size 3; family dynamics can influence behavior but data is limited\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_importance\", \"low\", \"considers God's role in her life; religious involvement can sometimes be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
