    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. However, being in one's early twenties can still be a high-risk time for reoffending, so I'll consider that as a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, the individual identifies as White. While race isn't directly a risk factor, it might correlate with systemic issues, but without more context, this is low impact.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant indicators, especially convictions, which can lead to higher recidivism rates. This should be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight at 6'3\" and 190 lbs might make him a target for certain crimes or intimidating others, but without criminal behavior linked to this, it's low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone could mean less support systems in place, which is a medium risk factor as social isolation can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong positive factor, making it low risk.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job during the year. Stable employment reduces recidivism, so this is another low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years is very positive and indicates lower risk of substance-related crimes, so that's low impact.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good mental health, contributing to a low risk.\n\nLiving in an urban area at a young age with non-biological parents might indicate exposure to negative influences but without more details, it's medium risk.\n\nLastly, his belief about God not influencing his life could affect his decision-making, potentially leading to higher risk behavior, so that's medium impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high and medium risks are balanced by several protective factors. However, past arrests and convictions weigh heavily. I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; however, it can still be a high-risk time for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor but may correlate with systemic issues\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction are significant indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly indicate risk unless linked to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status_residence\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate less social support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college and high school diploma are protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the year indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests good mental health\"),\n    (\"early_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in an urban area may indicate exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has no influence on personal events may contribute to higher risk behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
