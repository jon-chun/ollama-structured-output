    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties and showing some signs of stability, I might rate this as medium.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can be a factor, but it's more about socioeconomic factors than race itself. So probably low impact here.\n\nArrested once with a conviction. A single arrest is moderate risk, so that's medium.\n\nCurrently enrolled in college and has a high school diploma. Education is protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong positive factor\u2014high weight as it reduces risk.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be both good and bad. It shows independence but might lack support. I'd consider this low impact since other factors are more significant.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so that's low.\n\nNever married, no kids mentioned. Marital status can influence recidivism; being married is protective. Since he's single, it's a slight risk factor\u2014low to medium. I'll go with medium here.\n\nEmployment history: held one job in the past year. Stable employment is good, so high weight as it reduces risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. This might have a moderate impact\u2014medium.\n\nDepressed mood in the past month. Mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism. Recent depression is a high risk factor\u2014high weight.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas may have higher crime rates. This might balance out to low impact.\n\nReligious belief: considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is generally protective against recidivism, so high weight as it reduces risk.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the positive ones like education, employment, and religion are strong. However, recent drug use and depression could be significant negatives. The arrest and conviction also contribute to higher risk. Overall, the positives might outweigh the negatives, but there's still a notable chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race is less impactful than socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college with a high school diploma; education reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone; could indicate independence but lack of support\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'10\\\" and 140 lbs; no direct correlation to crime\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; marital status can influence recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Held one job in the past year; stable employment reduces risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use; drug use is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Reported depression symptoms; mental health issues increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in an urban area; mixed impact\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"high\", \"Religious involvement can reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
