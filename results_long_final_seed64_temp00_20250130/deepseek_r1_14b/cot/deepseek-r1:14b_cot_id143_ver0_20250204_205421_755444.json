    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. That's relatively young, but not extremely so. Younger individuals might have higher risks due to impulsive behavior, but it's not the highest factor here.\n\nShe's female. Gender can play a role; generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nRace is White. I'm not sure if race directly correlates with recidivism in this context beyond other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues. It might not be the strongest indicator here, so probably low.\n\nArrest history: she's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, but without a conviction, it's less certain. This could be medium because an arrest suggests some risk, but no conviction means maybe it was a minor issue or first-time offense.\n\nEducation level is a Bachelor's degree, which is positive. Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. So this should be low risk.\n\nEmployment: she's held four jobs in the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so having multiple jobs might indicate she's trying to stay employed, but it could also suggest instability if she's moving from job to job frequently. I'm leaning towards medium because while employment is good, frequent changes might not be as stable.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. This should be high because drug use often correlates with criminal behavior and can lead to further legal issues.\n\nMental health: she felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or stress. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism as they may impair decision-making or coping mechanisms. So medium risk here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is generally protective against crime, so this should be low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without more info on her upbringing, I'll consider it low.\n\nReligious beliefs: she doesn't see God's role in her life. Low religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's a weaker factor compared to others. So medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicators are drug use (high) and mental health (medium). The arrest history is also medium. Positive factors like education and employment might mitigate some risks, but given her drug issues and possible mental health struggles, I think she has a higher chance of recidivating. \n\nSo, prediction would be YES for rearrest, with confidence around 65% because while there are significant risk factors, there are also protective ones that could influence the outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; younger individuals may have higher risks due to impulsive behavior, but it's not the highest factor here\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race in this context does not directly correlate with recidivism beyond other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction suggests potential risk, as arrests can indicate future offenses despite the lack of a conviction\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Bachelor's degree is a positive indicator associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year may indicate instability or frequent changes, which could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible depression or stress, which can impair decision-making and increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area suggests some stability, though urban areas may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Low religious involvement could correlate with higher risk, but it's a weaker factor compared to others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
