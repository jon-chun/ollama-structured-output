    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Gender is female, which generally has lower recidivism rates. Race might influence but it's a sensitive area; I'll consider it low impact here.\n\nShe was arrested once without conviction. Arrests can be a factor, but no conviction might mean less formal system involvement, so that's somewhat mitigated.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education is usually protective against recidivism, so that's a positive sign.\n\nUnemployed for the past year\u2014unemployment is a risk factor, especially without current job prospects. That could be medium.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of rearrest, so high here.\n\nNo depression reported recently, which is good mental health. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but she's stable now.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, but she's young and possibly still has family connections. It's a bit mixed, maybe low impact.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a small urban household. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so that could be a slight risk factor.\n\nBelieves God influences her life\u2014spirituality can be protective, reducing recidivism chances, so positive.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest risks are drug use and unemployment. Positive factors include education and spirituality. The arrest without conviction is somewhat neutralized. Overall, the risk seems moderate but leans towards higher due to substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; younger adults have lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is a sensitive factor, but it is not a primary determinant of recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can be predictive but convictions are stronger indicators\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college with a high school diploma; education is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held in the past year; unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) which is strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month; good mental health can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone but likely has social support networks; living situation alone isn't a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in an urban area with biological mother; urban environments and family dynamics can influence risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"high\", \"Believes God influences her life; spirituality is often protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
