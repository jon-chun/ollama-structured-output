    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can be a factor in some studies, it's more about systemic issues than individual risk, so I'll consider this low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are significant because they indicate a pattern of behavior, which is high risk.\n\nConviction history adds to the risk since it shows he has been through the system before, making it medium.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of family support can be a risk factor, but it's not as strong on its own, so medium.\n\nGED without college enrollment might indicate limited education and fewer opportunities, which is a moderate risk.\n\nEmployed once in the past year suggests some stability, but if he lost that job or hasn't maintained steady employment, it could be a concern. I'll rate this low because having held a job shows some responsibility.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant factor. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so that's high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is positive and reduces risk, making it low.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological dad in a household of five could mean exposure to negative influences or unstable environment, which is medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. While spirituality can be protective, it might not directly impact recidivism unless it's tied to behavior change, so I'll consider this low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are multiple arrests and drug use. The conviction and living situation add more weight. So overall, the risk is higher than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are often at a higher risk for recidivism as they may still be establishing stable patterns of behavior\"),\n    (\"hispanic_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor, but it can intersect with other factors like systemic issues\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_5_times\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of problematic behavior and higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Convictions suggest a history of engaging in criminal behavior that could persist\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital ties and living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"GED_no_college_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Limited educational attainment can correlate with lower employability and higher risk\"),\n    (\"held_one_job_past_year\", \"low\", \"Employment history shows some responsibility but is not a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use_marijuana\", \"high\", \"Substance use, especially recent, strongly correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_depression_symptoms_recently\", \"low\", \"No mental health issues reported reduces risk\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_large_household\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and larger household size may indicate exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"spirituality_god_influence\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can be protective but not a direct indicator of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
