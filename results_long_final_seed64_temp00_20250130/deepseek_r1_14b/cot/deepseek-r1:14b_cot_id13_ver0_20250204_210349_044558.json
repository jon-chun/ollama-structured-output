    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be moderate.\n\nHe identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. I'm not sure about the statistics for this group specifically, but generally, recidivism rates can vary by ethnicity, though it's a low to medium factor here.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest is a moderate risk because it shows past criminal behavior, but without multiple offenses, it's not the highest.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so this is low.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Unmarried individuals might have higher risks, but since he's living alone, it could be a bit more concerning, making it medium.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education is generally protective against recidivism, so this is low risk.\n\nEmployment: No jobs held during the year. Unemployment can be a significant factor, increasing the likelihood of recidivism, so this is high.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor, so medium to high. Since it's recent and ongoing, I'll lean towards high.\n\nMental health: He felt down in the dumps recently. Depression or mood issues can increase risk, but without more severe symptoms, it's medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is protective, so low.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't see God's role in his life. Low involvement might correlate with higher risk, but this factor is usually weaker, so low.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicators are unemployment and drug use. These are significant predictors. Other factors like age, education, and family background somewhat mitigate but don't outweigh the negatives. The presence of mental health issues adds another layer.\n\nOverall, the combination suggests a moderate to high risk. I'll predict recidivism with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander; no specific data indicates high risk for this group\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history suggests past criminal behavior, a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone; unmarried individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college; education is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year; unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use; substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression recently; mental health issues can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban area; family stability may be protective\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Does not consider God's role in his life; low religious involvement may correlate with higher risk, but this is a weaker factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
