    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That's quite young, and I know that younger offenders are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. So, age could be a medium factor here.\n\nShe identifies as Black. While race isn't directly a risk factor, systemic issues can play a role, but I'm not sure how significant this is on its own. Maybe low impact.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty, which could be positive. But an arrest itself is still a negative mark, so maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014this is definitely a positive sign. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so her clean record here should be low.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. So another low factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 might mean she's independent but could also lack support networks. I'm not sure how significant this is, maybe medium.\n\nNever married and no children mentioned\u2014this doesn't directly relate to risk factors, so probably low impact.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be protective against recidivism, especially higher education. Since she's only got a diploma, it might not be as strong as having some college or a degree. So medium here.\n\nNo jobs during the year is concerning because unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates. Without stable employment, she might have fewer resources and more time on her hands, so this should be high.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area when young. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without knowing the specifics of their situation, it's hard to assign a weight. Maybe low impact.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with her life\u2014spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor, so the absence might be slightly negative, but I'm not sure how significant this is. Probably low.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors are unemployment and age; medium are arrest history, education level, and possibly living alone; low include race, mental health, depression, family background, spirituality, and marital status.\n\nI think the strongest factors here are her young age and lack of employment, which both point towards higher risk. However, she has no drug use or convictions, which are positives. Balancing these, I'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" for recidivism but with moderate confidence because there's a mix of positive and negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; younger offenders may be at higher risk\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but not a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential but no final outcome\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 19 may indicate lack of support networks\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college; education can be protective\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in urban area, unknown dynamics\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Does not consider God's role, may lack some support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
