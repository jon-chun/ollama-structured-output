    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. That's a young adult, but she might still be impulsive. However, being at the lower end of that age group could mean less established patterns of criminal behavior, so maybe low risk there.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that race can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, not necessarily individual risk factors. But in terms of recidivism prediction, it's more about personal history rather than race itself. So probably a low weight here unless other factors influence it.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. That's important because a conviction increases the likelihood of future offenses. Without a conviction, there might be less criminal history to consider, so that could be low risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to recidivism, so I can ignore those.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Not being married is common among youth, but not living alone might mean she has support systems in place, which could reduce recidivism. So maybe medium or low here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a known risk factor because it limits opportunities and can contribute to criminal behavior. That's probably a high weight.\n\nShe held four jobs in the past year. Multiple jobs might indicate instability or trying to make ends meet, which could be a sign of potential stressors leading to crime. So medium here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) recently. Drug use is a significant factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity. This should be high risk.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently. Depression or low mood can increase vulnerability to negative influences and recidivism, so that's another high weight.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. Family structure can influence behavior; growing up in a larger family might offer more support but could also mean more complexity. Urban areas have higher crime rates, which might be an environmental factor. So medium here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personally. Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism because of the sense of accountability and purpose. That's probably low risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: education is high risk, drug use and mood are also high. The arrest without conviction is low, family structure and urban environment are medium. So overall, the positive factors (religion) might balance some negatives but not enough to outweigh the significant risks like education level and substance use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; young adult with less established criminal patterns\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor, though systemic issues may influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction\", \"low\", \"Arrested once but no conviction; indicates lower immediate risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held four jobs; may indicate instability or stressors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use; substance use correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mood_disorder\", \"high\", \"Reported feeling down; mental health issues can increase risk\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a large urban household; environment may influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God's involvement; protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
