    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Juveniles are often at a higher risk because they're still developing, but since she's just turned 18, it might be a bit lower than younger teens. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but without more context on discrimination or past experiences, I'll rate this low.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. An arrest is concerning, but no conviction suggests she didn't get entangled in the justice system deeply. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big indicator; lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. So this is high.\n\nShe's living alone without being married, which can mean less support. That's a medium factor because it's a bit concerning but not the highest.\n\nEmployed at two jobs shows responsibility, so that's low risk. Employment is usually protective against recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently are positive signs. So these factors are low risk.\n\nHer background with her biological mother in an urban area of size 4 might indicate some family challenges but not severe enough without more info. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nLastly, she doesn't see God's role in her life. Spirituality can be protective, so the absence might slightly increase risk, making it a low factor.\n\nConsidering all factors, most are low to medium with only education being high. The positive aspects like employment and no drug use balance things out. I'm 65% confident she won't reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; juveniles may have higher recidivism rates but proximity to adulthood can vary\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic issues, but without additional context, this is considered low\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests potential risk but not definitive evidence of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED and no college enrollment correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without being married may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother and household size of 4 may indicate some challenges but not severe\"),\n    (\"spirituality_religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's role personally may have minimal impact on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
