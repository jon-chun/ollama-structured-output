    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low weight because younger offenders might be more rehabilitable.\n\nRace isn't a direct factor in risk assessment, so that's low too.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of high risk since multiple arrests correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight don't impact risk directly, so they're low.\n\nMarital status and living situation are both low because being unmarried and not living alone aren't significant predictors on their own.\n\nEducation level is low; he doesn't have a diploma or GED. However, education is more about future stability, which might be a medium factor if considering employment potential.\n\nEmployment: He held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so this is a medium positive factor but not as strong as others.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is high because substance abuse is a major risk factor for rearrest.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is low since mental health issues are more concerning if present.\n\nFamily background: grew up in a household of size 3, which isn't a significant indicator on its own, so low.\n\nReligious belief might have some protective effect but isn't a primary factor, making it medium.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high arrest and conviction history, along with drug use, heavily influence the prediction. The positive aspects like employment don't outweigh these negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is a relatively young age, which may indicate higher risk but also potential for rehabilitation\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a direct factor in risk assessment models\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not married is not a significant factor in itself\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Currently not living alone does not strongly indicate risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED may limit future opportunities and could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held 1 job in the past year suggests some stability but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression over the past month reduces risk in this category\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of size 3 does not strongly indicate risk\"),\n    (\"religious_belief_importance\", \"medium\", \"Considering God's role in personal events may have some protective effect but is not a primary factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
