    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, but being in their early twenties can sometimes mean lower risk compared to younger teens. I'll rate this as low since it's on the older end of the spectrum for high-risk groups.\n\nNext, she identifies as Black. There's a known disparity in the criminal justice system where minorities face higher recidivism rates, often due to systemic issues rather than individual factors. This is a significant factor, so medium seems appropriate here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be indicative of potential future offenses, but without a conviction, it might suggest that the case was dismissed or she wasn't found guilty. However, an arrest still raises some concern, so I'll rate this as high because even if there's no conviction, it's a marker.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism risk, so these are low factors.\n\nShe's never been married. Marital status can sometimes be a factor, but being unmarried isn't necessarily indicative of higher risk on its own. So this is low.\n\nLiving alone might mean she doesn't have strong social support, which could increase risk. But it's not the strongest indicator, so medium here because living alone can sometimes correlate with other factors like instability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important; higher education can be protective against recidivism. However, having just a diploma without further education might not provide as much protection, but it's still better than no diploma. So medium here because while it's positive, it's not the strongest factor.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally a good indicator of stability and lower risk. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, so this should be low since having two jobs shows responsibility.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a significant factor. Substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism because it can lead to further criminal behavior. This is high because drug use directly relates to potential future offenses.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some days, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression or other mood disorders can increase the risk of reoffending as individuals might turn to substances or other negative coping mechanisms. So medium here because it's a concern but not as severe as active substance abuse.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother and two others. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, which can contribute to recidivism. Family dynamics can also play a role, though she lived with her mother, which might provide some support. This is medium because the environment is a factor but not the sole determinant.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. So this is low as it's a positive factor that could mitigate risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: she has some high-risk elements like drug use and past arrest, but also several protective factors like employment, education, and spiritual beliefs. The strongest factors are her race (medium), past arrest (high), and drug use (high). However, the presence of multiple protective factors might lower the overall risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" for rearrest, but I'm not entirely confident because substance abuse is a strong indicator. Maybe 60% confidence because while there are risks, there are also significant protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old; young adults may have higher risk but less so than teens\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals face systemic issues increasing recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"One arrest indicates potential for future offenses despite no conviction\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married is not a strong indicator of risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma shows some stability but no further education\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate underlying issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"residential_history\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing in a household with biological mother\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs may provide protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
