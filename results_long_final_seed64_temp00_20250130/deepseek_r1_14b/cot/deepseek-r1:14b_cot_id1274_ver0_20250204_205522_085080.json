    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. That's relatively young, but not extremely low. Younger individuals might have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties and possibly still maturing, I'd consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. While race or ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates due to systemic issues, it's important to note that correlation doesn't imply causation. Without specific data linking Hispanic males to higher risks, I might lean towards low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrest history: he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate a couple of things\u2014maybe the charges were dropped or he was acquitted. However, arrests themselves can still be a risk factor because they might reflect a tendency towards criminal behavior despite no conviction. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\" and 202 lbs. Physical size isn't directly a risk factor for recidivism unless it's related to the type of crime, like if he were involved in violent crimes. Since there's no info on that, I'll consider this low.\n\nMarital status: never married and not living alone. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risks because of potential instability, but not necessarily always. Not living alone might mean he has some support system, which could be protective. So maybe medium here.\n\nEducation: high school diploma and enrolled in college. Higher education is generally a protective factor against recidivism as it provides better opportunities and reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. This should be low risk.\n\nEmployment history: held four jobs in the past year. Stable employment is another strong protective factor. Consistent work can reduce the temptation to commit crimes for financial gain. So this is definitely a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, especially marijuana, can be a significant risk factor as it might impair judgment and increase likelihood of criminal behavior. However, since he's using only marijuana and not other harder drugs, maybe medium.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed in the past month. No reported mental health issues is positive, so low risk here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with adoptive parents in a household of five in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but being part of a larger family might provide support. This could be medium as it's a mixed factor.\n\nSpiritual beliefs: considers God's role in his life. Spiritual involvement is generally seen as protective against recidivism because it provides a sense of purpose and accountability. So this should be low risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, most are either low or medium. The arrest history and drug use might push the risk higher, but overall, there are several protective factors like education, employment, and spiritual beliefs. Therefore, I would predict \"NO\" for rearrest with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity is considered, but without specific data linking to higher risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism unless related to crime type\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone; unmarried status can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Four jobs in the past year indicates stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use may increase risk but less severe than harder drugs\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family size; urban areas have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can be protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
