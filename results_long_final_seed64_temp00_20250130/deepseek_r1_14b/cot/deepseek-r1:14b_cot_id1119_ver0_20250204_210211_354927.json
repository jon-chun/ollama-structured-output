    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely so. However, being younger can sometimes mean higher risk due to impulsive behavior, so maybe a medium weight here.\n\nRace might be a factor in some contexts, but I should avoid stereotyping and focus on other more concrete factors instead.\n\nSix arrests without convictions could indicate he's involved in criminal activities but hasn't been proven guilty. This is significant but not the highest weight since no convictions yet.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime risk, so low here.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, which could be a slight factor, so medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college\u2014low education often correlates with higher recidivism. This should be a high-weight factor.\n\nUnemployed for the past year is a strong indicator of potential issues, so high weight here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is definitely a red flag. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so high weight.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, showing possible mental health issues or stress, which can contribute to recidivism\u2014medium weight.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 as a child might indicate a chaotic environment, but without more info, it's low impact.\n\nBelieving God has a role in his life could be either positive (support) or negative (fatalism), so probably low weight.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest are unemployment and drug use. Education level is also high. Mental health and living situation contribute moderately. Age and arrests are medium but not as strong. So overall, the risk seems moderate to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues but not a direct indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"6 arrests without convictions suggest potential criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not directly linked to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried status may correlate with higher risk but not definitive\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and no college enrollment is a strong negative predictor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year indicates potential economic strain and higher risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in dumps could indicate mental health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"family_household_size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of 4 may suggest a chaotic environment but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role may provide support or could indicate fatalism, impact is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
