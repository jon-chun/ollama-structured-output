    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might influence, but since he's now an adult, it's a medium risk here.\n\nRace could be a factor due to systemic issues, so I'll mark that as high.\n\nArrests are five times without convictions. Arrest history alone can be a red flag, so that's high.\n\nEducation-wise, no diploma or GED and not enrolled. Low education often correlates with higher recidivism, making this a medium risk.\n\nEmployment status is unemployed for the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator, so high here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Recreational drug use can be a factor, but without more severe issues, I'll note it as low.\n\nLiving situation: not alone and never married. Living with others might offer some support, but being unmarried could mean less responsibility, so medium.\n\nFamily background includes living in an urban area with his mother in a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, making this high.\n\nLastly, he doesn't see God's role in his life. Spiritual factors sometimes play a role, but without more info, I'll consider it low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the risk seems moderate to high. I'll predict recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; young adult, may still be developing\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues increasing risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 arrests without convictions suggest potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; low educational attainment often linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year; unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use but no other substances mentioned; may indicate limited substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone and never married; lack of stable relationships may contribute to risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing in a household of 5 with biological mother; urban environments often have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"spirituality_religion\", \"low\", \"Does not see God's role personally; low spiritual involvement may or may not impact behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 5 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
