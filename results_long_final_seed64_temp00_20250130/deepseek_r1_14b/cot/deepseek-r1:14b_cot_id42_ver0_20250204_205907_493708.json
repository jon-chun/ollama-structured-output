Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a key factor. Young adults are more likely to reoffend, so that's high risk.\n\nHe identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. I'm not sure if there's specific data on this group, but generally, recidivism rates can vary, so maybe medium here.\n\nArrested five times without conviction suggests he might not take responsibility seriously, which is a high risk factor.\n\nNo convictions could mean he hasn't been through the judicial system much, possibly low risk in terms of prior convictions, but multiple arrests are concerning.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being single isn't a direct indicator, but living alone might reduce support systems, so medium.\n\nHigh school diploma is good, but not enrolled in college. Unemployment is a risk factor since joblessness can lead to crime. He hasn't worked, which is high risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years indicates substance abuse, a strong predictor of recidivism\u2014high.\n\nNo depression recently suggests he's mentally stable now, but past issues could still be a factor. Maybe medium here.\n\nLived with biological dad in a small urban household. Family environment can influence behavior; if it was unstable, that's high, but without more info, perhaps medium.\n\nHe feels God isn't involved in his life. Lack of religious involvement is sometimes linked to higher recidivism rates\u2014medium.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are multiple arrests, unemployment, and drug use. These point towards a high risk. However, no convictions and mental stability might slightly lower the overall risk but not enough to offset the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a key age for potential recidivism as individuals are still developing\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander may have varying recidivism rates but not a primary factor\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 arrests without convictions indicate possible lack of responsibility\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest no formal judicial involvement\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stats are not direct risk factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may reduce support systems\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is neutral but lack of college enrollment could be a factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the year indicates potential economic strain\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use suggests ongoing substance issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological dad in an urban area, which could have influences\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role may indicate lower support networks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
