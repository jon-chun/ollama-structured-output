    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. Younger individuals might have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it's a medium factor.\n\nNext, race isn't typically a direct risk factor, so that's low.\n\nHe has one arrest without conviction. Arrests can be a sign, but no conviction might reduce the risk slightly. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so they're low.\n\nMarital status: he's never married and living alone. Unmarried individuals, especially those not in stable relationships, might have higher risks, so medium here.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not enrolled in college. Some education is better than none, but lack of further education could be a risk factor. Medium.\n\nEmployment: held one job during the year. Steady employment is protective, so this is low.\n\nDrug use: no usage in four years and no depression recently. Both are positive indicators, so low for both factors.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates. This could go either way, so medium.\n\nSpirituality: considers God's role in his life. Spirituality is often a protective factor, reducing recidivism risk. So this is low.\n\nNow, considering all factors, most are low or medium with only a few pointing towards potential risks like age and employment stability. The positive aspects like no drug use, education, and spirituality seem to outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I predict he won't rearrest, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is generally not a direct risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can be indicative but lack of conviction reduces risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate lower stability, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma; some education is protective but lack of college enrollment may be a slight risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year; steady employment is generally protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; abstinence from drugs reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed over the past month; good mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area; family stability can be protective but urban environment may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Considers God's role in his life; spirituality can be a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
