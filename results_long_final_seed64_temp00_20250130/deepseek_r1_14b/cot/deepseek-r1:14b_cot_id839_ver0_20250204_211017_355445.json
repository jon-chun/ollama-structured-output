    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be a medium factor.\n\nHe's male and identifies as White. Gender can influence recidivism rates, with males generally having higher rates than females. Race isn't directly predictive without considering other factors, so I'll rate this low.\n\nArrested once and convicted. A single conviction is significant but not overwhelmingly high risk. So, medium here.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical stats don't strongly predict recidivism on their own, so low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can be a factor\u2014those without stable support systems might have higher risks. Medium for this one.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor, but since he's not currently studying, it's a bit mixed. Low impact here.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. This should be high risk.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major red flag for recidivism. High factor.\n\nDepressed feelings recently, feeling down. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending. Medium here.\n\nGrew up in a rural household with his mother and three others. Family environment matters, but without more info on dysfunction, it's low impact.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Lack of strong religious ties can be a risk factor since religion often provides support. Low impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are unemployment and drug use. These high-weight factors suggest a higher risk. However, other factors like age and living situation add up. I'm leaning towards predicting recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"male gender is a known risk factor but not the strongest\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race generally has lower recidivism rates compared to other groups, though context matters\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"one arrest and conviction indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"average height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may indicate fewer social ties to reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone could mean less stability or support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma is a moderate protective factor but not strong without further education\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"unemployed for the past year is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4_years\", \"high\", \"use of marijuana and cocaine in recent years strongly correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_recent\", \"medium\", \"reporting feeling down could indicate potential mental health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"growing up in a rural household with biological mother, size 4; no specific indicators of dysfunction provided\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"lack of belief in God's role may reduce protective factors but not necessarily a strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
