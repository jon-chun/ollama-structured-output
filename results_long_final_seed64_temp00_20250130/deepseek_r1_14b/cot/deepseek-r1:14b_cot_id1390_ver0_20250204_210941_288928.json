    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are often at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, but it's also a time when people can change. So I'd rate that as medium.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. Race can be a factor in some studies, but it's complex and often intertwined with other issues like socioeconomic status. I'll go with low here since it's not the strongest indicator on its own.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong red flag for potential recidivism. That definitely points to high risk.\n\nHeight and weight, 6'3\" and heavy build\u2014this might make him more intimidating or seen as a threat, possibly influencing interactions with law enforcement or others. I'll consider this medium.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of family support can be a risk factor because he doesn't have a strong social network to help him stay out of trouble. That's medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is linked to better job prospects and lower crime rates, so this is a significant issue. High risk here.\n\nEmployed once during the year. Having some work history is positive, but it's only one job and recent. I'll rate this as low because it's uncertain if he can maintain steady employment.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014good sign. No depression symptoms recently also helps. Both are protective factors, so low risk for these.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and more challenges, but family ties could offer some support. I'll go medium here.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life\u2014spirituality can be protective, but lack thereof isn't necessarily a direct risk factor. So low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are arrest history and education. Medium include age, living situation, urban background. Low factors don't outweigh the negatives. The strong indicators point towards higher recidivism chance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; young adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White; race can be a factor but is often intertwined with other variables\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"medium\", \"6'3\\\" and heavy build may influence interactions or perceptions\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone; lack of family support can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled in college; education is linked to lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; some employment history but limited stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; absence of substance abuse reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not depressed over the past month; good mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban household; urban environment may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life; lack of spiritual connection may not directly impact recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
