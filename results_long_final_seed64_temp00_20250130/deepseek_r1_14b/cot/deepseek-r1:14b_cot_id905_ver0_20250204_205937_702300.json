    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger ages. Race might be a factor in some contexts, but without specific data on bias, it's hard to assign a weight here. Arrest history shows two arrests without convictions, which could indicate possible low criminal propensity or just bad luck.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Employment is stable with three jobs in the past year, suggesting responsibility. No drug use in four years and no depression recently are positive signs, reducing risk factors.\n\nFamily background includes living with his mother in a household of five, which might indicate some instability but not necessarily a direct risk factor. His belief in God could be seen as a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these, most factors lean towards low or medium risk. There's no strong indication of high-risk behaviors like substance abuse or prior convictions. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" for rearrest, with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults are at higher risk for recidivism but not extremely so\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but without specific data on bias, it's a low factor here\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without convictions could indicate potential criminal behavior or bad luck\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests basic education but no higher education which might be protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment with three jobs in the past year indicates responsibility and lower risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years significantly reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms recently suggests stable mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of 5 may indicate some instability but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be protective but not a strong predictor alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
