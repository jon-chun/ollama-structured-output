Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. However, younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. I don't recall specific data on this group, so maybe it's low unless there are known statistics indicating otherwise.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are significant; convictions also matter because they can indicate a pattern. This should be high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 230 lbs. I'm not sure how BMI or physical size directly correlates with recidivism, so probably low unless there's an obesity-related issue, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nMarried but living alone. Marriage is often a protective factor, reducing recidivism. However, living alone might mean less support, so this could be conflicting. Maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a strong risk factor for recidivism. This should be high.\n\nEmployed at two jobs during the year. Employment is protective; having multiple jobs might indicate stability but also possibly stress. Still, it's positive, so low as a risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's good and reduces risk, so low.\n\nDepressed feelings recently: feeling down for several days could be a sign of mental health issues, which can increase recidivism. Medium.\n\nLarge household size during youth (11 people). Large families might indicate more challenges or lack of supervision, so medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement is generally protective against crime, so low risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all factors: high arrest/conviction history and education are strong indicators. Positive aspects like employment and marriage temper some risks. Mental health and household size add moderate concerns. Overall, the positive factors might not outweigh the negatives enough to prevent recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander does not strongly correlate with recidivism trends\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Married but living alone may provide some stability but also potential isolation\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs suggests some stability, though it could indicate financial stress\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may indicate challenges or lack of supervision\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role in life is generally associated with lower recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
