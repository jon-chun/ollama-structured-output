I know that younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet and could be more impulsive. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity itself isn't a direct indicator, there might be systemic factors or community issues that could influence recidivism rates. But this is probably a medium factor.\n\nArrested twice with a conviction. Having prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher recidivism. This should be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 260 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight plays into recidivism, but maybe it relates to employability or health issues. Maybe medium here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being single and without family support can be a risk factor because there's less social support to help him stay out of trouble. That's probably high.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education is important; higher education can reduce recidivism. Since he has a diploma but isn't enrolled, maybe medium.\n\nEmployed once in the past year. Employment is protective against recidivism, so having held a job is positive. This should be low risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use could indicate substance abuse issues which are linked to higher recidivism. High factor here.\n\nDepressed feelings recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending because they might affect his ability to cope with stress or make poor decisions. High risk.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 3, urban area. Family dynamics and environment matter. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so this could contribute. Medium factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can be protective, as they might provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So low risk here.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: high (age, arrest/conviction, living alone, drug use, depression), medium (Hispanic, education, urban background), and one low (employment, religion). The majority are high or medium, especially concerning prior arrests, substance use, and mental health. So the prediction is YES for recidivism.\n\nConfidence level: Given the strong indicators like prior convictions, drug use, and depression, I'd say around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"21 years old; younger offenders are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may face systemic issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"High weight might affect employability or health, influencing risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"high\", \"Single and living alone reduces social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college; education is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employed once shows some stability, though limited\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use linked to substance issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression symptoms increase risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother may influence risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
