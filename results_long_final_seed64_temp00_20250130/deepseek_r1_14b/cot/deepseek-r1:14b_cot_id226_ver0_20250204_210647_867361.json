    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's male and identifies as White. Gender can influence rates, with males generally having higher recidivism. Race might play a role too, though it's complex. I'll consider this a high factor due to known statistics.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are strong indicators of future issues, so that's definitely high.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, but they might affect interactions or perceptions. I'll rate this low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Marital status can be a factor; single individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates. Not living alone could mean more supervision, which is mixed. Medium here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a significant predictor\u2014lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. High impact here.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment is a major risk factor as it reduces opportunities and increases stress. This should be high.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism, so this is high.\n\nDepressed feelings recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to coping mechanisms. Medium impact.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a household of 4. Family environment can influence behavior, but without more info, it's low.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement is generally protective, so this might reduce risk slightly. Low factor.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the high ones are arrest history, education, unemployment, and drug use. These strongly indicate higher recidivism. The prediction would be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger adults may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"racial factors can influence recidivism statistics\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"no direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone could imply less supervision or support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"unemployed for the past year indicates potential stressors and lower opportunities\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana and cocaine use are significant risk factors\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"recent feelings of depression could indicate emotional distress affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"growing up in a household with biological mother, size 4; limited specific information\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide some level of support but not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
