    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low weight because younger offenders might be more rehabilitable. Race as Black could have implications due to systemic issues but it's a medium factor here. Two arrests and convictions are significant, so that's high. Height and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so they're low.\n\nLiving alone without being married is a moderate risk since lack of support can be a factor. No diploma or GED is a concern because education links to better outcomes; medium. Having three jobs shows some stability but not enough to outweigh other factors, so low. Marijuana use in the past four years is a moderate issue as substance abuse can lead to recidivism.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is positive, so low risk there. Growing up in an urban area with his mother and two others might indicate challenges but it's medium. Believing in God could be protective, making it a low factor.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are prior convictions and lack of education. The moderate factors include race, living alone, drug use, and urban upbringing. The lows are age, employment, and religious views. Overall, the risk is higher than average but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; younger offenders may have higher potential for rehabilitation\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without being married may reduce support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held 3 jobs shows some stability but not a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may indicate ongoing substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother and household size of 3 may present challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role in personal life can be a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
