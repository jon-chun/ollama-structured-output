Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low weight because younger offenders might be more rehabilitable. Next, being male and White\u2014gender can influence rates, but race here doesn't add much beyond that.\n\nHe has one arrest without conviction; arrests are significant but lack of conviction might reduce the risk slightly. Height and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low there.\n\nLiving alone could be a red flag as lacking support systems is a medium factor. Education-wise, having a diploma is positive, while not being in college is neutral\u2014so low impact overall.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job, which is good but limited info, so low. Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a moderate risk factor. Mental health is fine as no depression reported, so low.\n\nFamily background with both parents and stable household size is positive, low risk. His spirituality doesn't affect him much, so low there too.\n\nConsidering all factors, most are low or medium, but some negatives like arrest and living alone might push the prediction to YES for recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is a relatively young age, which may indicate higher potential for change and lower risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct indicator of recidivism but can be a factor in systemic issues\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"One arrest, even without conviction, may indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate fewer social supports, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a positive factor but lack of college enrollment may be neutral\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held one job shows some responsibility but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can indicate potential for substance-related offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is generally protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's role may not directly impact recidivism but could affect coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
