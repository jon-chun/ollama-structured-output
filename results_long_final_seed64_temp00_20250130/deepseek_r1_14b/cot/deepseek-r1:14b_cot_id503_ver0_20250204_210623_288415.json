Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low risk because younger offenders might be more impulsive but also have higher potential for rehabilitation.\n\nNext, being male slightly increases risk compared to females, so that's medium.\n\nHe identifies as White; race isn't a direct indicator here, so it's low.\n\nNo prior convictions despite an arrest suggests lower risk, making this factor low.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so they're low.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, but without more info, it's medium.\n\nHaving a GED and not being in college could indicate limited education, which is a moderate risk factor.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job, which is positive\u2014low risk here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant factor. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism, so this is high.\n\nNo depression recently is good; mental health issues can increase risk, but absence lowers it\u2014so low.\n\nLiving in a rural area with non-biological parents might indicate limited support networks, which could be medium risk.\n\nConsidering God's role personally doesn't directly tie to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nBalancing all factors: high from drug use, others mostly low or medium. The positive aspects like employment and no conviction offset some risks. Overall, the chance of rearrest is moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; younger age may indicate higher impulsivity but also potential for rehabilitation\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender generally has a higher recidivism rate compared to female offenders\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk in this context\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"low\", \"No prior conviction despite an arrest, which may indicate lower criminal propensity\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest limited social support, which could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate without college enrollment may indicate limited educational attainment, which can be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held 1 job during the year suggests some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use in the past four years is a significant risk factor for potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression over the past month reduces this risk factor\"),\n    (\"residential_context\", \"medium\", \"Living in a rural area with non-biological parents may indicate limited social support networks\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role personally does not directly correlate with recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 230 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
