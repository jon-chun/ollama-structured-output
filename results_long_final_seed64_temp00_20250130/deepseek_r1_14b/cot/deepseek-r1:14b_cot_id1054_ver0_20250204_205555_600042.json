    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not particularly low. Juvenile records might influence, but he hasn't been convicted yet. So, maybe medium here because age can be a factor but not the most significant without prior convictions.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. While some studies show higher rates among minorities, it's more about systemic factors than individual risk. I'll consider this as low unless other factors amplify it.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, so that's a medium factor. The lack of conviction might temper the risk slightly.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; physical stats don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low here.\n\nMarital status: never married and not living alone. Being unmarried isn't a strong indicator, but living with others could mean more supervision or support, which is positive. So, medium for marital status as it's somewhat relevant but not the main factor.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma and not in college. Education can influence opportunities, so low impact here since he has at least a diploma.\n\nEmployment history: held one job during the year. Stable employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong positive factor\u2014high weight to reduce risk.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used in four years. Abstaining for that period is significant and suggests lower likelihood of substance-related crimes\u2014high positive impact.\n\nMental health: felt down recently. Depression can increase risk if severe, but it's recent and not specified as chronic. Medium factor here because mental health issues are a concern but not clearly severe.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could be a slight negative\u2014medium factor indicating some risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn't see God's role. Low religious involvement can correlate with higher recidivism, so medium here as it's a moderate influence.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the positive aspects like employment and no drug use are strong. However, factors like age, arrest history, urban background, and mental health could contribute to risk. The balance leans towards lower risk but not negligible.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity, which can be a factor but not the primary determinant\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not correlate strongly with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone; marital status can influence risk but is less significant here\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, which may provide some protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Stable employment history can be a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in the past four years; abstinence is a significant positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate potential risk factors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, which may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Does not see God's role in his life; low religious involvement can be a risk factor but is less significant here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
