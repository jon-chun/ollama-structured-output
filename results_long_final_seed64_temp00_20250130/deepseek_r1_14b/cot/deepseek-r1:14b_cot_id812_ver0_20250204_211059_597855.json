    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is on the younger side. Younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he's male. Statistically, men have higher recidivism rates than women, so that's another high point.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race directly correlates with recidivism in this context, but it's noted as a medium factor just to include all given info.\n\nArrest and conviction history: he has one arrest and one conviction. A single conviction is significant but not extremely high risk on its own, so that's medium.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so they're low.\n\nMarital status: never married. Unmarried individuals might have different support systems, which could be a slight risk factor, so medium.\n\nLiving alone could indicate less supervision or support, making it a medium factor.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education usually reduces recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is a strong protective factor, so that's low.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive; substance abuse is a big risk factor, but he's clean now, so low.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently suggest good mental health, another protective factor, so low.\n\nLiving arrangement as a child: lived with non-biological parents in a household of 4. This might indicate some instability or lack of support early on, which could be a medium risk.\n\nLastly, he considers God's role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, reducing recidivism, so that's low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the positives like education and employment are strong, but the younger age, male gender, conviction, and living alone might increase risk. Overall, it seems moderate, so I'll predict \"NO\" for rearrest with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"20 years old; younger offenders are generally at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals may have varying recidivism rates depending on other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"one arrest and one conviction indicate some criminal history\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are not directly linked to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may correlate with higher risk due to potential lack of support\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone could indicate limited social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"enrolled in college and has a high school diploma suggests good educational stability\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"having held two jobs during the year indicates steady employment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years reduces risk associated with substance abuse\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed recently suggests good mental health\"),\n    (\"early_living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"living with non-biological parents may indicate early instability\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"considering God's role in life may provide a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
