    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates due to systemic issues, it's more about other factors here. I'll consider this low unless other variables suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested once without conviction. An arrest is a red flag but no conviction might mean he wasn't charged or acquitted. This could be medium because arrests can indicate potential for future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Not being married is common among younger offenders, but living with others might provide support, making this a low factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits job opportunities. This should be high.\n\nEmployed once in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having held a job is positive but only once\u2014maybe medium since it's uncertain if he'll maintain employment.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so no recent use is good (low). No depression also reduces stress-related crimes, another low.\n\nLived in a large household as a child. Large family size can sometimes indicate more challenges but might also mean more support. I'll rate this medium because it's unclear without more info.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior, but lack thereof isn't directly linked to crime. So low.\n\nConsidering all factors: high school dropout is a significant risk. Employment and no drug use are positives. Age and arrest history moderate the risk. Overall, I'd say medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity alone is not a direct indicator of recidivism without other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married is common among younger offenders but not a strong predictor alone\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide some support, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college strongly correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job shows some responsibility but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_size_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a large household; could indicate challenges or support\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief about God not affecting personal life doesn't directly correlate with crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
