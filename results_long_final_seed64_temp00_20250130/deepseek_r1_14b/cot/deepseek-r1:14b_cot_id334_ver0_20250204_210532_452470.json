    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, men have higher recidivism rates than women, so that's high.\n\nRace being White might influence, but it's complex. Some studies show disparities, so I'll consider this as low impact compared to other factors.\n\nArrested twice with convictions indicates past criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of future issues\u2014high risk here.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, but it's not the strongest factor. Medium?\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment could affect employability. He has held three jobs, which shows some stability but isn't a strong protective factor. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant because substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior\u2014high risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently suggests mental health isn't an issue now, so low impact.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five in an urban area might indicate socioeconomic challenges, which can contribute to higher risk. Medium here.\n\nBelieving God influences his life could be a protective factor if it's strong, but it's not the most reliable indicator\u2014low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high ones are prior arrests and drug use. The medium factors include age, living alone, and background. So overall, the risk is moderate to high. I'll predict YES for rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger adults are at higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"males have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic issues but not the strongest factor here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"two arrests and convictions indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are not strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"living alone may reduce social support networks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma without college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"having held three jobs shows some stability but not a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana and cocaine use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"growing up in an urban household of five may indicate socioeconomic challenges\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"belief in God's influence may provide some protective factors but not a strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
