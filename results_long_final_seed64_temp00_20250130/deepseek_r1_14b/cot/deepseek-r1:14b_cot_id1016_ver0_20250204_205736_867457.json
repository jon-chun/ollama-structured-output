    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Juveniles are often at a higher risk because they're still developing, but since she's just turned 18, it might be a bit lower than younger teens. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nShe identifies as Black. There's some evidence that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, which could affect her risk, so that's high.\n\nArrested three times without convictions. Arrests can indicate higher risk, but no convictions might mean she hasn't been found guilty yet. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low here.\n\nNever married\u2014marital status isn't a strong predictor, so low.\n\nLiving alone could be a risk factor because lack of support might lead to more issues. That's high.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is linked to lower recidivism; higher education reduces it, so this is high.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year\u2014employment is protective, so low.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014positive indicator, so low.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently\u2014good mental health can reduce risk, so low.\n\nLived in a household of six when young. Larger families might have more challenges, but it's not a direct predictor. I'll go with medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Religious involvement is generally protective, so low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: high and medium risks are present, especially education and living alone. However, positive aspects like employment and no drug use might balance some of that. Overall, the risk seems moderate but leaning towards higher due to several medium factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; juveniles are at a higher risk for recidivism but may have lower rates as they age\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests without convictions suggest potential risky behavior but no proven guilt\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married is not a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can be a strong predictor of higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Currently employed suggests some stability and lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No signs of depression recently indicates better mental health\"),\n    (\"family_size_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of six may indicate challenges but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role can be protective, though not a strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
