    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old Hispanic female over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That's quite young, and younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability, which could contribute to higher risk. So I'd rate that as high.\n\nShe identifies herself as Hispanic. While ethnicity alone isn't a direct indicator, there might be systemic factors or community issues that could influence her risk. But this is probably a medium factor.\n\nShe's been arrested three times without convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without convictions. This seems like a high risk factor because multiple arrests suggest ongoing issues.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll skip that one.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support, which could be a medium risk. Unmarried status isn't directly a risk factor but combined with living alone, it's worth noting as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can influence opportunities and stability. Not being in college might limit her prospects, so that's a medium risk.\n\nNo jobs during the past year indicates unemployment, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because lack of employment can lead to criminal activity. This should be high.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but has been feeling down recently. Recent depression could affect her behavior and decision-making, so that's medium.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have its challenges, like higher crime rates or social issues, making it a medium factor.\n\nLastly, she believes God influences her life. While spirituality can be protective, it might also lead to more rigid thinking if things don't go as planned, so that's low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high ones are age, arrests, unemployment, and maybe drug use history (though she hasn't used recently). The medium factors include ethnicity, living alone, education, depression, urban upbringing, and spirituality. \n\nI think the strongest indicators here are her multiple arrests and lack of employment, which are both high risks. Her recent depression also adds to that. So overall, I'd predict a YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age can indicate higher impulsivity and potential instability\"),\n    (\"hispanic_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Ethnicity may correlate with systemic factors but not directly indicative\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_no_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrest history suggests ongoing issues despite no convictions\"),\n    (\"lives_alone_unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and unmarried may indicate lack of support network\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_in_college\", \"medium\", \"Education status could limit future opportunities\"),\n    (\"unemployed_last_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"recent_depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can influence behavior and decision-making\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_parents\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may contribute to higher exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"spirituality_importance\", \"low\", \"Spirituality might offer support but could also lead to rigid thinking\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
