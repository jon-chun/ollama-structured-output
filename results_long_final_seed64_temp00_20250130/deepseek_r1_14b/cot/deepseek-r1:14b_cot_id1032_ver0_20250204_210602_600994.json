    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Gender is female, which generally has lower recidivism rates. Race isn't a direct factor here since she identifies as mixed race, and there's no indication of bias in the data provided.\n\nShe was arrested once without conviction. Arrest history can be a risk indicator, but the lack of conviction might suggest it wasn't a serious offense or that the case was dismissed. However, even an arrest can sometimes signal potential future issues, so I'll consider this as medium.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked to higher recidivism because of limited job prospects and social support. This seems like a strong indicator, so high weight here.\n\nEmployment status: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor as it correlates with financial stress and lack of structure, which might lead to criminal behavior. High impact here too.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs in four years. Abstinence is positive, but recent drug issues could still influence behavior. Since she's clean now, this might mitigate some risk, so low weight.\n\nMental health: She felt down recently, indicating possible depression or stress. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not managed, so medium impact here.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a household of four. Larger family size isn't inherently bad, but without more context on environment or support, it's hard to assess. Maybe low impact unless there were issues, which aren't mentioned.\n\nReligious beliefs: She doesn't see God's role in her life. While spirituality can be protective, absence here might not necessarily increase risk, so probably low.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are education and employment status, both high. Arrest history is medium, as is mental health. The rest are low. Considering these, there's a moderate risk but leaning towards higher due to education and unemployment. I'll estimate confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old; younger adults may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Mixed race is not a direct risk factor, as race itself is not predictive in this context\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can be indicative of potential future issues\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; low educational attainment is strongly linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year; unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years; recent abstinence is positive, but lack of information on prior use limits assessment\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression recently; mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not managed\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up in a household of size 4; family size alone is not predictive without additional context\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Does not believe God has personal role; spirituality can be protective but absence here may not significantly impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
