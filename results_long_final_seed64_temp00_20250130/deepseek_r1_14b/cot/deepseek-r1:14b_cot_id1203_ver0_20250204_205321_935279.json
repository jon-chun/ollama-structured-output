    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly low. However, younger adults are often at higher risk, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nRace can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but it's a sensitive area. I'll consider it as a low factor unless other variables suggest otherwise.\n\nArrest and conviction history are strong indicators. Four arrests and convictions significantly increase the risk, making this a high factor.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nMarital status\u2014being unmarried isn't necessarily a bad sign, but living alone might be a slight concern. I'll rate this as low.\n\nEducation level is concerning because lacking a diploma or GED can limit opportunities, making it a high factor.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job, which is positive but not enough on its own\u2014medium.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a moderate risk. Some usage isn't severe unless combined with other factors, so medium here.\n\nDepression symptoms are significant because mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. This should be high.\n\nFamily background in an urban area and household size might indicate challenges but aren't direct predictors\u2014low factor.\n\nReligious beliefs don't directly correlate with crime, so that's low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: four arrests/convictions (high), education lacking (high), drug use (medium), depression (high). These are strong indicators. Other factors like age and employment are mixed but not as impactful. The overall risk seems high enough to predict recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which may slightly increase risk but not significantly\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but it's a sensitive factor and not the primary indicator\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and convictions indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status is common among many individuals and doesn't strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but isn't a direct predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held 1 job shows some stability but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression symptoms indicate potential vulnerabilities that could increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing and household size are not direct predictors but may suggest challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role is generally neutral or protective, not a strong predictor of crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
