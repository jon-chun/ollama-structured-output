    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Gender being female usually indicates lower risk, so that's a low factor.\n\nRace might be considered, but I should avoid stereotyping. However, systemic factors could play a role, so maybe medium here.\n\nArrest history: she was arrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk indicator, but without a conviction, it's somewhat mitigated. So medium.\n\nEducation level is high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education is generally protective, so low impact here.\n\nEmployment: held 3 jobs in the past year. Stable employment is positive, reducing recidivism chances\u2014low factor.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used in four years. Abstinence is good, so low risk here.\n\nMental health: felt down recently. Depression symptoms can be a risk factor, but they're not severe enough to indicate high risk\u2014medium.\n\nFamily background: grew up in a household of size 2. Not sure about dynamics, but small families might have less supervision; maybe medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God's role. Protective factors like religion usually lower recidivism\u2014low impact.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium with only a couple as medium. The positive aspects like employment and no drug use outweigh the negatives. So I'd predict NO rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence risk, though not the primary factor here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and not currently enrolled in college; education is generally protective\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 3 jobs in the past year, indicating some stability\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years; abstinence reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down recently, which could indicate potential mental health struggles affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background_size\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a household of size 2; smaller family size may have less supervision or support\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in her life; religious involvement can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
