    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these assessments to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each factor:\n   - Age: 22 years old\n   - Race: White\n   - Arrest history: 2 arrests, 1 conviction\n   - Physical characteristics: Height and weight\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living situation: Currently living alone\n   - Education: High school diploma, not in college\n   - Employment history: Held 5 jobs in the past year\n   - Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\n   - Mental health: No depression in the past month\n   - Childhood household size: 3 people\n   - Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism risk.\n\n3. Use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n4. Determine the confidence level in this prediction.\n\nLet's go through each factor:\n\n1. Age: 22 years old - Medium (young adults are at higher risk)\n2. Race: White - Low (race is not a strong predictor on its own)\n3. Arrest history: 2 arrests, 1 conviction - High (previous criminal activity increases risk)\n4. Physical characteristics: Height and weight - Low (not typically predictive of recidivism)\n5. Marital status: Never married - Medium (lack of stable relationships can increase risk)\n6. Living situation: Currently living alone - Medium (social isolation can be a factor)\n7. Education: High school diploma, not in college - Medium (limited education can increase risk)\n8. Employment history: Held 5 jobs in the past year - High (instability in employment is concerning)\n9. Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years - High (substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism)\n10. Mental health: No depression in the past month - Low (no current mental health issues reported)\n11. Childhood household size: 3 people - Low (not typically predictive on its own)\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events - Medium (can be a positive factor, but not always)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and considers all provided factors. However, it's important to note that some factors like race and childhood household size are typically considered low risk on their own but can interact with other factors in complex ways. The assessment of religious beliefs as medium might be too simplistic; research suggests that strong religious beliefs can actually reduce recidivism risk.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's use these assessments to make a prediction:\n\nThe individual has several high-risk factors (arrest history, employment instability, substance use) and multiple medium-risk factors. While there are some low-risk factors as well, the overall picture suggests an increased likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all factors, it appears that the risk of recidivism is higher than average. The presence of several high-risk factors outweighs the lower-risk ones. However, we should also consider that this individual has a high school diploma and no current mental health issues reported, which could be mitigating factors.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of about 70%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in some contexts, it's not typically predictive on its own\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Previous criminal activity significantly increases the risk of future offenses\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not typically strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships can increase risk, but being never married at 22 is common\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Social isolation can be a factor, but living alone at 22 is also common\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Having only a high school diploma may limit opportunities and increase risk\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Instability in employment is concerning and often associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially of substances like cocaine, strongly correlates with increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No current mental health issues reported, which could be a positive factor\"),\n    (\"Childhood household size\", \"low\", \"Not typically predictive on its own, but can interact with other factors\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"While potentially positive, the impact of religious beliefs on recidivism is complex and variable\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account multiple risk factors that suggest an increased likelihood of rearrest within three years. The individual's history of arrests and convictions, recent substance use, employment instability, and limited education all contribute to a higher risk profile. While there are some mitigating factors such as no current mental health issues and a high school diploma, the overall picture suggests a significant risk of recidivism.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 70% because while the evidence strongly points towards an increased risk, individual circumstances can vary greatly in criminal justice outcomes. Factors not mentioned in the assessment (such as access to rehabilitation programs, family support, or personal motivation for change) could potentially influence the actual outcome.\n</output>",

She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
