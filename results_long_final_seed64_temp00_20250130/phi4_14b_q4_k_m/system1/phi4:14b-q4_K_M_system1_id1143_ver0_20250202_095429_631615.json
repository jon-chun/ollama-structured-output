Additionally, his belief that God has nothing to do with personal events might suggest a lack of religious or spiritual support systems, which can sometimes act as protective factors.\n\n6. **Living Situation:** Currently living alone could indicate social isolation, another potential risk factor for recidivism.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to the assessment of high risk, though individual circumstances and additional context would be necessary for a more precise evaluation. The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple significant risk indicators but acknowledges that not all factors are definitive predictors on their own.",
