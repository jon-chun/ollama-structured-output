Holding one job during the year is relatively typical for someone of his age and educational status.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past use of marijuana and cocaine indicates some risk, but without current usage or dependency issues reported, it's less concerning.\n\n5. **Mental Health:** The absence of depression over the past month suggests stable mental health in that regard.\n\n6. **Family Background:** Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area is a neutral factor; it doesn't strongly indicate high risk.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs:** A lack of belief in personal divine intervention might suggest a more secular worldview, but this alone isn't a strong predictor of criminal behavior.\n\n8. **Living Situation and Marital Status:** Living alone and being unmarried are typical for someone his age and do not inherently increase risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be concerning (e.g., past drug use), the individual's educational pursuits, lack of convictions, and stable mental health suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of some risk factors but an overall positive outlook based on current information.",
