His belief that God has nothing to do with his life might suggest a lack of religious influence, but this alone does not indicate high risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be concerning (e.g., education and employment), the absence of convictions, drug use, or mental health issues suggests a lower immediate risk. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the available information.",
