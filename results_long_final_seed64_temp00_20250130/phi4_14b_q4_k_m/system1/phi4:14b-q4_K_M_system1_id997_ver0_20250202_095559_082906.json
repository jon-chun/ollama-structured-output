However, enrollment in a 2-year college shows an effort towards improvement. Holding one job indicates some level of stability.\n\n6. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, but without current substance abuse issues, it does not significantly elevate risk.\n\n7. **Mental Health:** Experiencing feelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") suggests a need for mental health support, which could be a moderate risk factor if unaddressed.\n\n8. **Family and Social Environment:** Growing up in a large family in an urban area can present challenges but also opportunities for strong social networks. Her belief in God may provide personal resilience or support.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas of concern (e.g., mental health, education), the factors do not collectively indicate a high risk of reoffending. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the limited data and potential for positive change with appropriate interventions.",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
