A single arrest without conviction does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics:** Height and weight are neutral factors in this context.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being unmarried and living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but these factors are not definitive on their own.\n\n5. **Education and Employment:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED and holding only one job during the year could suggest potential socioeconomic challenges, which might contribute to risk, but they do not strongly indicate high risk without additional negative indicators.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive factors that reduce perceived risk.\n\n7. **Family Background:** Growing up with both biological parents in a household of size 5 is generally considered stable, which reduces risk.\n\n8. **Religious Belief:** Considering that God has something to do with personal events can be seen as a stabilizing factor, potentially reducing risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could contribute to risk (e.g., lack of education and employment stability), the absence of convictions, drug use, or mental health issues suggests a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of both mitigating and potential risk factors.",
