He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He is divorced and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 6 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 7, in a rural area.
