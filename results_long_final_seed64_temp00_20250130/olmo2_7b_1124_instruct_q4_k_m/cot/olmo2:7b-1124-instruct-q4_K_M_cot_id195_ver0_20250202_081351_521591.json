The individual's youth and multiple arrests are weighted as \"high\" risks due to their potential impact on recidivism. Gender and race are considered \"medium\" risks, reflecting general trends without accounting for individual circumstances. Employment status and drug use are rated as \"high\" risks because they can significantly influence the likelihood of reoffending. The absence of recent depressive symptoms and a stable family environment during childhood are associated with \"low\" risk. The belief in religious intervention is considered a \"low\" risk factor due to its potential to provide moral guidance. Overall, the prediction leans towards recidivism (\"YES\"), with a confidence level of 75%.",
