The reasoning behind each risk factor score is provided in textual detail:\n\n- **Age**: Low risk due to being young, but concerns about lack of structured life experiences are noted.\n- **Arrests**: Medium risk due to a pattern of arrests without convictions, indicating potential for future legal issues.\n- **Education**: High risk due to the lack of a high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n- **Living situation**: Low risk because living alone could imply independence but lacks the support system that might otherwise be beneficial.\n- **Drug use**: None, indicating a stable mental health profile which generally reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe overall prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 75%. This suggests a relatively low risk of reoffending within three years based on the provided information.",
