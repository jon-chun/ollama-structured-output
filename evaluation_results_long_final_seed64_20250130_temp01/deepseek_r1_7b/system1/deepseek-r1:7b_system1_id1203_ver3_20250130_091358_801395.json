    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age is typically not a strong indicator on its own, but being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in some contexts, though it's important to note that this isn't a blanket statement and varies based on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest increases the risk of reoffending, so multiple convictions are a strong red flag.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some contexts, without knowing his body fat percentage or other metrics like BMI, it's hard to assess if this is a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors related to social isolation, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be linked to recidivism rates; not having a degree might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability is often correlated with lower risk of reoffending, so holding a job could actually mitigate some risks, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt very down for parts of the past month. Drug use can be a serious risk factor, especially if it's recent or if he's struggled with substance abuse which can lead to other risky behaviors.\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This could indicate exposure to certain environmental factors that might increase risk, such as family dynamics or potential neglect, though this is speculative without more context.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, it's not clear how strongly this belief impacts his risk directly.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions are a major red flag. His drug use and lack of education also contribute significantly. The other factors don't necessarily add much to the risk unless combined with more concerning aspects like family living conditions or significant social issues.\n\nConsidering all, I would lean towards high risk but not certain without more data. So, maybe an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
