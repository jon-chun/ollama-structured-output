    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's not inherently predictive without more context. So, I'll note that but move on to other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Recidivism is a significant concern here because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's a strong indicator pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an indicator, it's not directly related to risk unless combined with other factors like BMI or health issues. So, I'll keep this in mind but don't consider it alone as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which might mitigate some risks, but without knowing the surrounding environment or social networks, it's hard to assess its impact on risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a key predictor of success in life; not having a diploma can limit opportunities and increase dependency on welfare or incarceration, which are risk factors.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job stability is crucial for financial security and personal growth. Having no job (or just one) suggests instability, which could lead to high risk behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down frequently recently. Substance abuse can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and negatively affect relationships, all of which are indicators of high risk.\n\nHe feels down for much of the past month. Emotional distress or low mood is a sign of mental health issues, which can contribute to risky behaviors like substance use or self-harm.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a crowded home can lead to exposure to negative influences, lack of supervision, and potential family dysfunction, all of which may increase risk.\n\nLastly, he believes in God's influence on his personal life. While belief in a higher power can provide motivation for good behavior, it doesn't necessarily protect against risky decisions if other factors are present.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance abuse, and emotional distress all point towards high risk. The presence of these factors significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behaviors again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
