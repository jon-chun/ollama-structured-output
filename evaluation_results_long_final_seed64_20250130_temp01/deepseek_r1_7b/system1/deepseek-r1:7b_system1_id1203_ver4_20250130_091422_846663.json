    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism, it's not always directly indicative without more context. So maybe that's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which is definitely a high-risk indicator because each arrest increases the chances of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some contexts, without knowing his body fat percentage or other health metrics, it's hard to assess if this is particularly concerning. Maybe a low confidence here.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and currently single. Living alone doesn't inherently make someone a risk, but combined with other factors like prior convictions, it might suggest some instability, which could be a moderate factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism; not having a degree can increase the risk as he may have fewer opportunities for positive employment or skill development.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability is important, especially with limited income sources if he loses his job. This could be a high-risk factor because unemployment can lead to dependency and further criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use, particularly marijuana, which is a mild substance compared to others like cocaine or heroin, but even so, it's still an indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can contribute to risk.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying mental health issues. While not everyone who feels this way commits crimes, it could be a sign of deeper problems that need addressing, adding to the risk assessment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a large family can sometimes lead to neglect or abuse if there are issues within the household, which might contribute to higher risk factors like substance use or criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, without evidence of actual spiritual involvement in mitigating negative behaviors, this factor is probably not strongly indicative of high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions are a strong indicator (YES with high confidence). The lack of education, limited employment, substance use, and living situation also contribute to moderate to high risk. However, the low mood might be a red flag but perhaps not as significant without more context on mental health support or intervention.\n\nSo overall, considering all factors, it's likely a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
