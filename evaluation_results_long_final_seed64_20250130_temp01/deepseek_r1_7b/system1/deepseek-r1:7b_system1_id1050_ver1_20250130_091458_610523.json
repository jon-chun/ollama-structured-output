    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is quite young, which might not be directly related but considering his criminal history, it could play a role. He has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; two times is already concerning as each conviction can increase risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs. While weight isn't inherently high risk unless combined with other factors like substance use, which he does have here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly indicate risk but could be a contributing factor if there are issues with support systems or mental health.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Educational barriers can sometimes lead to unstable situations, especially combined with substance use.\n\nHe has held five jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs might suggest some level of responsibility, but it's also possible he's struggling to find steady employment, which could contribute to other issues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently felt very down. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of high risk as it can lead to self-harm or suicide thoughts, especially if combined with mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of six in an urban area. High family size could mean more stress or neglect, which might contribute to behavioral issues. Urban environments sometimes have higher rates of crime and substance abuse.\n\nReligious belief that God has something to do with his personal events. While this doesn't directly indicate risk, it's possible he may struggle with mental health if there are unresolved issues or if his faith isn't providing the support he needs.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions, drug use, living in a high-stress environment, and educational barriers all point towards a high risk. The presence of substance abuse is particularly concerning as it can lead to more severe outcomes. Therefore, I would predict this individual has a high risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
