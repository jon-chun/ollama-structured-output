    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of African American descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism, it's not always directly indicative without more context. He has been arrested four times and convicted once, which is a significant number of offenses\u2014this could definitely indicate higher risk as each prior offense increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they don't provide direct insight into his behavior or suitability for risk assessment. Moving on, he's never married and living alone\u2014he might be more susceptible to stressors that could lead him towards substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers can contribute to substance abuse issues and lack of opportunities, which are known risk factors. His job history shows he's held only one job during the year\u2014this might indicate instability, which could lead to financial strain and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a history of drug use, specifically marijuana, over the past four years. Drug abuse is a major red flag as it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to further legal issues. Additionally, he admitted feeling down for much of the past month\u2014this could be a sign of mental health issues or underlying stressors that might contribute to substance use.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age suggests potential family dynamics issues. Small households can sometimes lead to higher dependency on others, which might not directly correlate to risk but could influence his behavior in other areas.\n\nHis belief in God indicates he has some level of spirituality or faith, which is generally protective against certain types of recidivism, especially violent crimes. However, this factor alone doesn't negate the high risk posed by other indicators like multiple prior arrests and drug use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014multiple prior convictions, drug use, lack of education, unstable living situation\u2014the individual appears to be at a high risk for future criminal behavior or substance abuse issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
