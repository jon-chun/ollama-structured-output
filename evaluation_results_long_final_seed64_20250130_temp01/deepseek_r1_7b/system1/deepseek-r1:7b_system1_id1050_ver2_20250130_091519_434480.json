    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors like criminal history or substance use. He has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant criminal history; two arrests can be concerning, especially if it's his first offense but then again, one conviction might indicate past behavior.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs. Weight alone doesn't usually predict risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or living situation. He's single and living alone, which could contribute to isolation and potential stressors, possibly leading to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and has no GED, indicating he might not have the education needed for stable employment or effective life skills. Not enrolled in college suggests he may be struggling academically or with motivation, which can lead to further issues.\n\nHe's worked five jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences could indicate resilience, but it also shows instability if he's frequently employed due to circumstances like substance use or lack of stable housing.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent heavy use in the last month. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential for further substance misuse, which can affect both personal and social relationships, increasing risk factors like theft or accidents.\n\nHe feels down for much of the time and has been feeling this way for months. This could be related to his living situation, lack of support, or other stressors. It might also indicate underlying mental health issues that could worsen if not addressed.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. High family size can lead to neglect or emotional abuse, especially in an urban setting where resources might be limited. This environment could contribute to behavioral issues and substance use as coping mechanisms.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't know how that affects his personal behavior. However, religious beliefs can sometimes serve as a coping mechanism for stress or trauma, which might influence risk behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, drug use, living alone with potential neglect, lack of education and employment stability, and recent feelings of low mood. These factors collectively point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
