    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of African American descent. Age-wise, 21 is relatively young, but being Black can be associated with higher crime rates in some contexts, so that might contribute to a higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of criminal history, which typically correlates with higher recidivism rates. So this definitely points towards high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. While height and weight can sometimes be associated with certain types of crimes or health issues, they aren't direct indicators of risk on their own.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation alone doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are other factors involved, but it's not a strong indicator here.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug use or criminal activity. This is another point towards high risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to unstable living situations, which might contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for some months recently. Drug abuse, especially marijuana, is a known precursor to more serious criminal behavior and can increase the likelihood of being involved in illegal activities.\n\nHe experienced a significant emotional low at young age, which affected his mood. Emotional instability or trauma from early life can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors later on.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age might indicate exposure to a chaotic environment, which could have long-term effects on behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has some level of religious involvement or faith. While this doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, it's possible that his lack of strong community support (since he's living alone) could increase vulnerability to negative influences.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests, drug use, living situation, lack of education and employment, emotional issues from early life\u2014all point towards a high risk. The combination makes me highly confident this individual is at significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
