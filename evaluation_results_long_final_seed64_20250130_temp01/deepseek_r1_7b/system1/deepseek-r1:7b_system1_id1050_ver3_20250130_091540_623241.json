    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is typically not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean he's still developing his skills and could be more susceptible to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Each arrest adds to the risk profile.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches, weight 185 lbs. No direct indication from these measurements about his risk unless combined with other factors like BMI or health issues, which aren't provided here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence substance use; being single might mean he doesn't have a support network to turn to when things get tough.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates, so not having a degree could increase his risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held five jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce stress, but if he's been unemployed for long periods, that might be a concern.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with some recent use in the last month. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of high risk as it can lead to other risky behaviors like theft or violence.\n\nHe feels down most of the time and was unable to find comfort during a bad period. Emotional distress without support can exacerbate substance use issues.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. High family size might mean more stress or less supervision, which could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. While religious belief isn't directly linked to criminal risk, it can affect self-esteem and coping mechanisms if it doesn't align with his experiences.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, emotional distress, unstable living situation, lack of education\u2014all point towards a high risk. The presence of substance abuse in the past four years is particularly concerning, especially combined with recent use. His young age might mean he's still developing coping skills, which could make him more susceptible to further issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it seems highly likely that this individual poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year.
