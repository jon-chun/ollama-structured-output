    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors like criminal history or substance use. He has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant criminal history; two arrests can be concerning, especially if it's his first offense but then again, one conviction might indicate past behavior.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs. Weight alone doesn't usually predict risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or living situation. He's single and living alone, which could contribute to isolation and potential stressors, possibly leading to substance abuse issues he mentioned.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates, so not having this can increase risk. He has held five jobs during the year; job instability can lead to financial strain and substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent heavy use in the last month. This is a red flag for substance abuse, which is strongly linked to criminal behavior and risk of further offenses.\n\nHe felt so down that nothing could cheer him up at a young age when living with six family members in an urban area. This indicates possible mental health issues or environment stressors, both of which can contribute to risk behaviors like drug use.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his personal events. While this doesn't directly indicate risk, it's important to consider if there are underlying issues not mentioned here that could affect behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, substance abuse, lack of education, job instability, and possible mental health issues all point towards a high risk. The factors seem significant enough to justify a high confidence level in predicting a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
