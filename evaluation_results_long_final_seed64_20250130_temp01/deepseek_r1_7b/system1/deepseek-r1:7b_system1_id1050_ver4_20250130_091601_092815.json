    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is quite young, which might not be directly related to risk unless there are other factors. Being Hispanic doesn't inherently make someone a risk, but it could be a socioeconomic factor that affects his situation.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Recidivism rates for individuals with prior convictions are high, so this alone points towards a high risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 185 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some contexts, without knowing his BMI or other health factors, it's hard to assess if this contributes to risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are issues with social support or stability, but that's not provided here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree might increase his chances of engaging in risky behavior if he's seeking better opportunities.\n\nHe has held five jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability, so this might actually reduce risk by indicating he's been proactive about finding work.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a major risk factor for various issues like theft, violence, and health problems. The fact that he felt down and couldn't find cheer suggests possible depression or anxiety, which are also linked to higher risk behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. High family size can lead to stress and dependency on others for support, potentially increasing risky behaviors like substance abuse or neglect.\n\nHe believes in God's influence over his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide stability but might also be linked to certain risk-taking behaviors if they lead him away from societal norms.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (2), drug use (past four years), living with multiple family members, and young age are strong indicators of high risk. The lack of education and employment history don't necessarily mitigate these risks. Therefore, the prediction should be YES with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year.
