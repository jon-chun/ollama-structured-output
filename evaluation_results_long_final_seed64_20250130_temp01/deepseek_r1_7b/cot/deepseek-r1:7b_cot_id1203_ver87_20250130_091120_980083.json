    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this person over the next three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male with four prior arrests and convictions. That seems like a high number, which is definitely concerning because more arrests can mean worse behavior or more supervision issues in the future.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. I don't know how his weight affects recidivism directly, but maybe it could influence things like substance use or physical health, which might be related to rearrest.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse and hasn't married anyone yet. Single status can sometimes mean less support network around him, possibly making him more vulnerable if he starts using substances again.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a red flag because not completing education can lead to unstable situations, either economically or socially, which might push someone back into trouble.\n\nHe has only held one job during the year, so his income is likely low. Unemployment can be tough on someone mentally; maybe he's dealing with stress or substance use issues without proper support.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use is a big risk factor because it can lead to other crimes, mental health issues, and social problems that might make him reoffend.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That suggests he was raised by multiple people, which could mean he's had inconsistent support or exposure to different environments. Urban settings can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal life. While spirituality might help some people stay on track, if that's not a strong enough force for him, it might not provide the necessary support for avoiding recidivism.\n\nNow, putting this all together: four prior convictions, single living situation, lack of education, unemployment, recent drug use, and inconsistent family background all point towards high risk. The factors seem to be stacking up strongly. I don't see any mitigating factors that would lower this risk significantly. Therefore, the prediction should be a high risk with very low confidence because while the factors are strong, without more data on support systems or intervention, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something? Could his living situation in an urban area affect his stability? Possibly, but without knowing if he has any support networks there, it's still a risk. Also, his belief in God might offer some guidance, but if that doesn't translate into action or support, it's not enough.\n\nSo yes, I think the overall risk is high because of all these factors combined.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four prior arrests and convictions, which indicates a tendency towards criminal behavior and potential supervision issues in the future.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may reduce social support, increasing vulnerability to substance abuse or other destabilizing factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can contribute to unstable economic situations and mental health challenges that may lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Employing only one job during the year suggests low income, which might be associated with stress or substance use issues without adequate support.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of hopelessness can increase risk of reoffending due to substance-related issues and underlying mental health problems.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five in an urban area at a young age may correlate with inconsistent family support and exposure to higher crime rates, potentially influencing criminal behavior over time.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not necessarily provide strong support for avoiding recidivism; if spirituality is not actively influencing his life positively, it may not be a mitigating factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
