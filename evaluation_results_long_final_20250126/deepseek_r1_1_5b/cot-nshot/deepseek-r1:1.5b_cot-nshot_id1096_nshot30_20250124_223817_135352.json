    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk factors for this case. The person is a 20-year-old female Hispanic, and from what I can gather, she's not been arrested yet but has one prior arrest without conviction. She's 5 feet 1 inch, never married, currently living alone. She has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college, held three jobs, used no drugs, hasn't felt depressed for the past month. The household is size six in an urban area with both biological parents.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, most factors either don't contribute much or are neutral. For instance, living alone and having a high school diploma aren't strong indicators of recidivism. So I think each factor here is probably low risk. \n\nShe's Hispanic, which might be linked to certain behaviors in other cases (like example 29), but overall it doesn't stack up. She hasn't used drugs or felt depressed, which are usually positive signs against recidivism.\n\nSo all the factors seem neutral or low. The prediction is NO recidivism with around 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"res identity\", \"low\", \"She identifies as Hispanic, and from examples like #29, being Hispanic might influence behavior but not directly linked to recidivism without more info\"),\n    (\"res living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces recidivism risks as seen in others with similar circumstances\"),\n    (\"res education\", \"medium\", \"No GED or enrollment; some have positive outcomes in examples like #27 where non-citizens had low recidivism but here she's white and has a diploma),\n    (\"res jobs held\", \"low\", \"She holds three jobs, which may not correlate with severe recidivism as other factors don't contribute much\"),\n    (\"res no substance use\", \"medium\", \"No drug use or mood issues; examples like #27 where non-citizens had low recidivism suggest neutral but some cases didn't have it),\n    (\"res living in a high population area\", \"low\", \"Urban area reduces recidivism as seen in others with lower risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"res no prior convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction; in examples like #1 where an arrested person had recidivism, moderate risk is common but here she's Hispanic which might have positive outcomes)\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
