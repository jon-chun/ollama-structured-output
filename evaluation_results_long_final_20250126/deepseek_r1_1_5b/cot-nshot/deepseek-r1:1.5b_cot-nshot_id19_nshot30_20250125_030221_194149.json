    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to predict a case's rearrest recidivism outcome based on given risk factors and some examples provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each risk factor entails. From the examples, it seems like each factor can be categorized into low, medium, or high risk, which then influences the recidivism outcome.\n\nThe case in question is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White, has been arrested 4 times and convicted, weighs 135 lbs, never married, currently living alone, has a high school diploma but not enrolled in college, has held 5 jobs during the year, used drugs (marijuana and coke), and had feelings of depression leading to no hope. His upbringing is through biological parents in an urban area, and he considers God unrelated.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each factor contributes to a recidivism outcome. Factors like mental health issues, substance abuse, criminal history, living alone, being from a specific background, and emotional well-being have varying effects based on their severity.\n\nIn this case:\n- Lack of education and job stability (holding 5 jobs) might be seen as low risk if not causing immediate re-arrest.\n- Negative feelings about life due to depression could be medium or high depending on how it affects his behavior.\n- High criminal history is a clear red flag, especially given the recent convictions. This would likely increase recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the situation seems high-risk because of the combination of substance abuse (cocaine + marijuana), negative mental state (depressed feelings leading to hopelessness), and criminal history that's been a problem. The other aspects like living alone or being from an urban area might have some impact but are less severe in this case.\n\nBased on the examples, factors like substance abuse and multiple convictions are associated with higher recidivism rates. So, combining all these into a single outcome seems to predict high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"person has been convicted of multiple offenses, which is a clear indicator of potential reoffending\"),\n    (\"negative_mental_state\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"depressed feelings from recent mood issues and hopelessness contribute to the risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"consistent criminal history with past convictions suggests a higher likelihood of re-arresting\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"lived alone for most of his life, which can lead to increased recidivism risks in some contexts but may not be the primary factor here\"),\n    (\"background\", \"low\", \"white background and specific race might have subtle effects on behavior that aren't as pronounced),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"medium\", \"holding multiple jobs could affect his ability to stay employed post-arrest but isn't a primary risk factor here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
