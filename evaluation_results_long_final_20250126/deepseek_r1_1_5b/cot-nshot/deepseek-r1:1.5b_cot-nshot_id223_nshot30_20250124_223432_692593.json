    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a detailed query about predicting recidivism for a specific case using a set of risk factors from examples. My task is to analyze the given case based on those examples and assign a score.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors present in the provided case. Let me go through each aspect:\n\n1. **Gender**: The person is 20 years old and White.\n2. **Education Level**: High school diploma but enrolled in a 4-year college. So, he's not yet out of education; it just started.\n3. **Marital Status**: Currently living alone.\n4. **Family Structure**: Lived with biological mother in a small household (size 3).\n5. **Living Arrangement**: Home-based, not in a duplex or apartment.\n6. **Drugs Used**: Cocaine in the past four years.\n7. **Depression Level**: Not feeling depressed at all.\n8. **Age and Gender**: Young adult male.\n\nNow, I'll look at the examples provided to see how these factors were considered. All examples consider several aspects: gender, education level, marital status, family structure, living arrangement, drug use history, depression levels, age, and gender again. They also assess each factor on a low, medium, or high scale based on historical data from similar cases.\n\nIn the given case:\n- **Gender**: White is considered high risk if not Black.\n- **Education Level**: Not out of education but in 4th year college. From examples, married individuals with higher education might have lower recidivism rates. So, this could moderate the risk a bit.\n- **Marital Status**: Currently living alone is low risk as being by himself reduces chances.\n- **Family Structure**: Small household (3 people) suggests that larger families may face more stress and potential reoffending due to less support networks.\n- **Living Arrangement**: Home-based means no duplex or apartment, which might be seen as safer.\n- **Drug Use History**: Cocaine is a heavy drug use history. From examples, individuals with severe drug use in youth tend to have lower recidivism rates because they're more likely to reintegrate.\n- **Depression Level**: No depression, so this doesn't contribute much.\n- **Age and Gender**: As a young adult male, he's considered at risk but may not face as many reoffending factors due to his age.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n- High education might lead to lower recidivism compared to someone with a high school diploma. But being in 4th year college could mean they're more aware of their mistakes and have more opportunities.\n- Living alone is very low risk.\n- Small family size (3) might make it easier, but I'm not sure if that's a strong or weak factor.\n- Cocaine history shows significant reoffending tendencies. From examples, individuals with significant drug use in youth tend to have lower recidivism rates.\n- Age and gender being young males are typically at higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The person is White (high), has some education but not fully out of it, living alone (low), small family (maybe a bit more manageable), high drug use history, and young. These factors collectively suggest that the risk isn't extremely high but also doesn't seem very low either. Based on examples where having significant drug use in youth leads to lower recidivism rates, this case's drug use is probably a moderate factor.\n\nHowever, the high education level might not significantly affect recidivism, and living alone could be a strong factor. So, maybe overall, it's at a medium risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"White\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"High school diploma but enrolled in 4-year college\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Household size 3\", \"moderate\"),\n    (\"Cocaine history (past four years)\", \"high\"),\n    (\"Depression level (none)\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Age and gender (young adult male)\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}",
