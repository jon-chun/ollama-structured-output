    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. So, first, I need to look at all the risk factors provided in the examples and see which ones apply to this particular case.\n\nThe person is an 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. They've been arrested 6 times but not convicted yet. Their weight on the scale is 5 feet 11 inches, which is about 170 cm, and they weigh 165 lbs. That seems a bit light for their height, so maybe that's a risk factor.\n\nThey haven't been married and are currently living alone. No jobs during the year means no prior history of employment, which might be concerning. They've used marijuana in the past four years and haven't felt depressed over the last month. Their household is small\u201410 people in rural area\u2014and they consider God nothing to do with their situation.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, there are several risk factors like weight, substance use, family structure, living alone, criminal history, etc. The prediction needs a relative weight for each factor and then combine them.\n\nI think being Hispanic increases recidivism because of cultural influences on behavior. Their weight seems low compared to height, which might pose a risk. They're single without employment, which could mean poor relationships and less stability. Using marijuana is concerning as it's an avoidable activity. The small family size and rural living area also contribute to isolation.\n\nSo combining these: weight (low?), weight on scale lower than expected\u2014maybe low. Hispanic increases recidivism. Single alone\u2014moderate risk. No prior substance use, but they've used it recently; maybe not high. Racial background (Hispanic) higher risk. All this makes me think the recidivism is likely.\n\nWait, in the examples, people with no jobs and being single tend to have lower recidivism rates because there's less opportunity for reoffending. So even though they're Hispanic, living alone and not employed might reduce it. But their weight being low compared to height and using marijuana could increase risk.\n\nI'm a bit torn. Let me think: Hispanic increases recidivism, no prior substance use but recent use\u2014maybe a slight risk, but overall maybe high because other factors like living alone and weight are significant.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Hispanic\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic is associated with higher recidivism rates due to cultural influences on behavior\"),\n    (\"Weight (165 lbs vs. expected based on height of 5'11\\\")\", \"low\", \"The weight being lower than expected could indicate a risk factor impacting their behavior and criminal activity\"),\n    (\"Single without prior substance use but recent use\", \"moderate\", \"Living alone with no previous substance use might contribute to lower recidivism, yet the recent marijuana use adds another layer of risk\"),\n    (\"Family structure (small household size)\", \"low\", \"A small rural family living area might result in less social support and stability, affecting reoffending behavior\"),\n    (\"Racial background (Hispanic)\", \"high\", \"Hispanic identity is linked with higher recidivism due to cultural influences on criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
