    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples provided, most of them had a \"NO\" outcome. The ones that were \"YES\" usually included elements like low education, no drug use, and living with only biological parents in urban areas. But this case doesn't fit those criteria as much.\n\nHis age is 22, which isn't too high, so maybe not a big risk factor there. He's white, but the examples didn't show a difference between races except for example 30, which was a Black man. The recidivism here seems lower than expected because of his background.\n\nHe has been convicted twice and is still in college, which could indicate some instability. But since he's single at age 22, maybe that's better. He's from an urban area where crime rates are higher, but also where there might be more support services or mental health resources available.\n\nHe didn't use drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed. This suggests a stable environment, which could lower recidivism chances. His living situation with only biological parents is standard, not a high risk area unless they're known to have issues.\n\nLooking at the examples, most factors led to \"NO\" because of unstable environments or lack of support. So this case fits within those parameters. The education level being high and in college might lead some people to recidivism, but if it's a non-traditional path, maybe it's less likely. The living situation is standard, so the overall risk seems low enough that the recidivism outcome is \"NO.\"\n\nI think I've considered all the factors here. No major issues like low education or unstable housing, and stable environments where there are resources. So, the prediction should be NO with a high confidence level.\n</think>\n\nThe case of the 22-year-old male doesn't fit the criteria for higher risk factors as seen in the examples provided. His background, living situation, education, and lack of drug use suggest a lower risk of recidivism.\n\n**{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high school diploma\", \"medium\", \"The person has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college, which may indicate some instability.\",\n    \"No stable environment leading to low recidivism risks.\",\n    (\"unstable living situation\", \"medium\", \"Residence with only biological parents in urban areas might offer more support and resources than traditional cases.\",\n    \"Stable housing and access to resources likely reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}**",
