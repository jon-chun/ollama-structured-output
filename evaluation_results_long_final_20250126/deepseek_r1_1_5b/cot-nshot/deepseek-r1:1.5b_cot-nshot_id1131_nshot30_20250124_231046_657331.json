    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I have a case of an 18-year-old Black female who's been arrested once and has been convicted. She's 5 feet 10 inches, weighs 127 lbs, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma but is in college now, has one job, used drugs (marijuana), didn't feel depressed for the past month, and lived with her parents in a city.\n\nI need to assign weights to each risk factor and predict recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\n1. **Risk of Low\u6d88\u8d39**: She's 18, single, living alone. Maybe this reduces recidivism because there's less social support for substance use. So low.\n\n2. **High Education**: She has a high school diploma but is in college now. Higher education might increase risk because more opportunities and access to resources could help reintegrate. So medium.\n\n3. **Job Instability/Unemployment**: She only has one job, so maybe less of an issue than someone with two or three. Low?\n\n4. ** substance use history (marijuana)**: She's been using it for a while now. More use over time can lead to recidivism as there might be more patterns. Medium.\n\n5. **Depression**: Not feeling down in the past month is positive, so less risk. Low? Maybe not, but I think low here because she's managed emotionally.\n\n6. **Family Income/Support System**: From a family of 4 living in an urban area. Urban areas might be more expensive and have different social systems. So medium.\n\n7. **Social Support**: She has both biological parents, which is good. High support for reintegration.\n\n8. **Previous Interventions or Services**: No prior substance use services. Maybe less impact on recidivism because without any help in the past, it's harder to address now. Low.\n\n9. **Criminal Record**: She has a conviction, but it's only once. Not too bad for recidivism risk factors. Medium.\n\n10. **Age and Gender**: 18 is relatively young, gender Black. Maybe less likely to have serious issues as they develop. So low.\n\nNow, weighing these:\u6d88\u8d39 (low), education (medium), job (low), substance use (medium), depression (low), family support (high), previous services (medium), criminal record (medium), age and gender (low).\n\nI think the main risks are low consumption, substance use, depressed, and maybe a bit of family issues. But I'm not sure about the high education. So overall, it's on medium risk.\n\nBased on examples where similar factors resulted in medium recidivism without too much support for services or previous interventions, this case might be at medium risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Low\u6d88\u8d39\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Medium Education\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Low Job Instability/Unemployment\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Medium Substance Use History (marijuana)\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Low Depression\", \"low\"),\n    (\"High Family Income/Support System\", \"high\"),\n    (\"Good Social Support from Parents\", \"high\"),\n    (\"No Previous Interventions/Services\", \"low\"),\n    (\"Medium Criminal Record\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Gender\", \"low\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 62\n}",
