    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to tackle this case analysis step by step. So, the user provided a detailed scenario where we need to assess rearrest recidivism for a specific 22-year-old female. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each of the risk factors mentioned in the previous examples and see how they apply here. The key points are: she's White, has been arrested twice, convicted, 5 feet 5 inches, weighs 130 lbs, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college, holds one job, used marijuana in past four years, not depressed for four months, and lived with non-biological parents in an urban area.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, I need to assign a medium weight to each factor if it's average or low. If any factor stands out as high risk, that might influence the outcome more significantly.\n\nShe's a White woman, which doesn't immediately ring a bell for recidivism rates, so maybe she has a moderate risk? Being in a small household of five suggests potential strain, so that could be a high risk if living alone. The weight here is medium because while it's not super severe, it's also not minimal.\n\nHer previous convictions are significant; being charged twice adds to the risk level. Weighting this as medium makes sense since her criminal history is substantial but not excessively so.\n\nWeighted by her age and education\u2014she's 22 with a high school diploma but in college now\u2014which would increase the risk factor. So, that\u2019s a high weight because she might face higher risks due to being older and possibly less experienced.\n\nNot living alone adds another layer of stress; if someone is single, they might feel isolated more, which is a high risk element. The weight here should be medium since it's an additional factor but not the highest concern.\n\nHer weight in the job she holds\u2014she works one part-time job\u2014doesn't seem too bad, so maybe low or medium. But since she has a single job, that could indicate strain at work, which might affect her mood and behavior, making this a high risk element with a higher weight.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years is concerning, though not overly severe. It's a drug use problem, so it should be weighted as low because it's a manageable issue without extreme consequences.\n\nNot feeling depressed for four months means she has some emotional support and stability, which is positive. So, this could be moderate or even high risk if other elements are too overwhelming.\n\nBeing raised in an urban area might influence her environment and opportunities, but unless there are specific issues related to that area, it's probably medium risk.\n\nPutting all these together: convictions (medium), living alone (high), not living with family (high), weight in job (medium), marijuana use (low), emotional support (moderate), and urban setting (medium). \n\nNow, considering the overall factors\u2014several high risks like living alone and marijuana use would tip this case towards a moderate or higher recidivism risk. Without other major issues, I'd estimate a medium weight for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lived_alone\", \"medium\", \"She is living with non-biological parents in a small household of five, which could lead to stress and strain.\",\n    \"She is not typically associated with severe recidivism but may face increased risk due to her isolation.\",\n    \"Medium\"),\n    (\"weight_in_job\", \"low\", \"She holds one part-time job, which might contribute to work-related stress.\",\n    \"Her job is manageable, so this factor is less concerning than others.\",\n    \"Low\"),\n    (\"weight_marijuana_use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years indicates a potential issue affecting her.\",\n    \"Marijuana use is considered a minor behavior change but may impact mood and decision-making.\",\n    \"Low\"),\n    (\"weight_previous_consultations\", \"medium\", \"She has never been charged with anything, which could be seen as a weaker factor.\",\n    \"No significant criminal history indicates lower risk.\",\n    \"Medium\"),\n    (\"weight_emotional_support\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed for four months shows some emotional support but not extreme levels.\",\n    \"Positive mood and stability contribute to overall well-being.\",\n    \"Medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
