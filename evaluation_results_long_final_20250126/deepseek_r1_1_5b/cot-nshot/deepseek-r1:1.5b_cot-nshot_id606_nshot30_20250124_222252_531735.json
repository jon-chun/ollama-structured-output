    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and see how they might affect the recidivism rate.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which suggests he has significant mental health issues that could lead to recidivism. His weight as White might be relevant because some studies show that race can influence recidivism rates. Since he's been convicted multiple times, it's clear there's a problem with his behavior or mental state.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 168 lbs. That seems about right for a 19-year-old male. His education level is a GED certificate and isn't in college, which could mean he has some academic issues. He's never been married and is living alone. Single parents might face different circumstances compared to married individuals.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which I think could be an advantage because it reduces his support system and makes the situation more isolated. His household size is 4, so maybe a small community with manageable living conditions. His family background isn't mentioned, but since he identifies as White and has convictions, that might indicate underlying issues.\n\nHe's lived with both of his biological parents in a rural area for a while now. Being raised by his parents could provide some stability. His behavior is primarily on substance use\u2014marijuana\u2014and he hasn't felt depressed. That's concerning because substance abuse often leads to relapse, and if he's not feeling better, it might worsen the situation.\n\nPutting this together: He's young, single, has significant convictions, and has substance use issues without a positive emotional state. This combination of factors makes me think he's at high risk for recidivism because his substance use isn't helping him, living alone in an isolated community can make it worse, and being raised by parents might provide some comfort but not enough to counteract the substance abuse.\n\nThe examples given had mostly low or medium risks, but this case has multiple high-risk factors. If these are all present, the recidivism probability should be higher than average.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"excessive use of marijuana with no positive emotional response and living alone in an isolated community with support from biological parents presents significant risk for relapse\"),\n    (\"lived_with_parents\", \"low\", \"stabilizing living conditions but not ideal for substance abuse without a positive emotional outcome\"),\n    (\"family_maintenance\", \"medium\", \"rural family environment provides some stability but isn't conducive to recovery from substance abuse without support and emotional well-being\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"multiple arrests and convictions indicate significant mental health challenges that could lead to relapse even in the absence of substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"single_parenting\", \"medium\", \"moral and emotional independence can sometimes help reduce relapse, but living alone still poses a risk without support from parents\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"unspecified family history isn't mentioned, potentially limiting recovery chances despite other factors\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
