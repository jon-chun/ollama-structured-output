    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old Hispanic male. Let me break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Hispanic male, which might influence his behavior because he has a higher chance of being more aggressive and less law-abiding. He was recently arrested four times and convicted, showing significant past crimes. That\u2019s a strong indicator of potential reoffending.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so he likely lacks some basic skills, which could lead to more serious issues both in court and daily life. Being alone for most of his time is another risk because he might face more adversarial situations without support.\n\nThe fact that he didn't take a job during the past year suggests he's either inactive or has part-time work, possibly leading to less engagement in community involvement. His down mood in the past month probably stems from stress and despair, which isn\u2019t positive for recidivism prediction.\n\nHe lived with both parents in an urban area, which might mean more exposure to crime and social issues. His behavior of using marijuana and cocaine adds a lot of substance use risk factors. This could lead to both legal consequences and potential delinquency.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors\u2014past criminal history, low education, alienated living situation, substance abuse, and emotional distress\u2014strongly suggest he's at higher risk for recidivism. Without addressing these issues, especially substance abuse and criminal history, the likelihood of rearrest is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_crime\", \"high\", \"he has been arrested four times and convicted, indicating significant past criminal history\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"he does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, raising the risk of lack of basic skills and potentially less engagement in community involvement\"),\n    (\"lived_alone\", \"likely\", \"he is currently living alone for most of his time, leading to more adversarial situations without support\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"he used marijuana and cocaine, indicating a substance abuse risk factor that could lead to legal consequences and potential delinquency\"),\n    (\"emotional_stress\", \"moderate\", \"his recent emotional struggles show significant stress affecting his behavior and mental health\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
