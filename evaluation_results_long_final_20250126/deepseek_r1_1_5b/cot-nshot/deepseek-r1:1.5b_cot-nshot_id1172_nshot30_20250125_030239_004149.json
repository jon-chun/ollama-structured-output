    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old Black male. So, he's a 19, identifies as Black, has been arrested once, convicted. He's 5'10\" and weighs 155 lbs. No jobs, never married, currently living alone. GED, not in college. Used marijuana, didn't feel depressed last month.\n\nLooking at the examples, most factors seem to influence recidivism positively or negatively. High risk factors include substance abuse, low income, not being alone enough, and being Black. These are all negative indicators that could increase recidivism rates.\n\nIn his case, he's living alone (low), uses marijuana (maybe moderate since it's a drug), hasn't used anything else. He's not married, no jobs, no education or college. He didn't feel depressed much last month. The person from examples with low recidivism had issues with substance use and being in poor circumstances.\n\nSo, his low living situation, no other issues, no education, no substance abuse (moderate maybe?), so overall risk seems high. That would lead to a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"residue\", \"low\", \"since he's living alone and has a non-WSU/WSAB status, which is a negative indicator for recidivism\"),\n    (\"marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"used marijuana but not enough frequency to infer severe impact on recidivism here\"),\n    (\"no_jobs_or Jobs\", \"low\", \"no income from employment or salary, making it harder for him to afford college or other services\"),\n    (\"not_married\", \"low\", \"lower risk if he had a spouse and support system\"),\n    (\"not_in_college\", \"low\", \"suggesting potential lack of employability or societal pressures that could affect recidivism\"),\n    (\"black identify\", \"low\", \"Black individuals often face unique challenges and may have lower recidivism rates based on examples, but this is still a low risk here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
