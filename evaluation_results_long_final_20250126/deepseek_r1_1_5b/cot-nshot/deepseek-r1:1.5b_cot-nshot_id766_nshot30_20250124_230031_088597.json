    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 22-year-old White female who's been convicted has a high chance of rearresting her next three years. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, she's married and living with her spouse. That might affect recidivism because being in a committed relationship could put more pressure on them to stay away from law enforcement or other criminal activities. But I'm not sure if that alone is enough to make her likely to rearrest.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, which means she might have some work experience. Maybe that's a plus because people with prior experience are less likely to get caught again. But I should consider how the skill level and experience translate into recidivism rates.\n\nShe uses marijuana, which is an illegal substance. Law enforcement agents can use it as a tool against individuals. If she's using it in her marriage, that could increase the risk of her getting involved with criminal activities in the future. That seems like a significant factor to consider.\n\nHer mood isn't great\u2014she felt down and didn't feel depressed. That might indicate she's more likely to take things out of control or make irrational decisions. But without knowing the source of her depression, it's hard to link that to recidivism.\n\nThe household size is 5, rural area. Rureric areas can have different social dynamics\u2014maybe less support for law enforcement and higher rates of criminal behavior because they might feel isolated more. That could contribute to a higher recidivist rate since she's in a less supportive environment at home.\n\nShe has two jobs during the year, which shows she's employed. Employers are more likely to keep people away from law enforcement or criminal activities. So her employment status is another positive factor that might lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting all this together: married, not college educated but with some experience, uses a controlled substance (marijuana), and in a rural area. These factors seem to increase the likelihood of recidivism. The lack of support from her spouse and the use of marijuana create pressures that could make her more likely to reintroduce herself into criminal activities.\n\nI think these points are strong enough to suggest a high probability of rearrest, so I'll predict \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\nThe factors contributing to her potential recidivism include being in a committed relationship, having some work experience despite not pursuing education, using a controlled substance like marijuana, and living in an environment that may contribute to criminal behavior. These elements together suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"married\", \"medium\", \"She is in a committed relationship with her spouse, which increases the stress and pressure she might face in future criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"non_college_education\", \"low\", \"Her lack of education, combined with possible work experience from her jobs, may reduce recidivism rates than others with higher education but without significant experience.\"),\n    (\"uses_marijuana\", \"medium\", \"The use of marijuana by law enforcement agents can create pressure to engage in criminal activities regardless of the individual's intent.\"),\n    (\"rural_area\", \"low\", \"Living in a rural area might result in less support for law enforcement and higher rates of criminal behavior due to isolation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
