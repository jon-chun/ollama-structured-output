    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this case for rearrest recidivism. The person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested twice but not convicted. She's 5 feet 2 inches, weighs 160 lbs, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. She's had two jobs, used drugs mostly (marijuana and cocaine) during the past four years, felt down most of the time, lived with biological parents in a rural area, and God doesn't seem to be an issue here.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, especially #30, where a 20-year-old Hispanic female with similar factors had a negative outcome. She also held two jobs, used drugs often, felt down, and lived in urban areas. The reasons were that she was married and living in bigger cities, which contributed to her recidivism.\n\nIn this case, she's not married (if the examples don't show marriage as a factor). But she's rural, possibly with lower mobility costs. She has two jobs but doesn't mention any issues about work hours or stress that could lead to recidivism. The fact that she's enrolled in college means she might have taken some time off, which is another risk factor.\n\nShe used drugs mostly (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. From #29, where using substances was associated with lower recidivism rates, this could be a concern. Even though she has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, substance use might not be a primary reason for her being back.\n\nShe's lived alone most of the time and has no support network, which is another significant risk factor. Without support, she's at higher risk for criminal behavior or reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together, while she's high school educated and has jobs, the factors like substance use, living alone, lack of support, and possibly being married (if that's considered) contribute to recidivism. In examples #30 and others, these factors led to negative outcomes. So, despite her college enrollment, which might suggest progress, the other factors make it a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being_married\", \"medium\", \"She is married but not explicitly stated as such, yet she has two jobs and lived with biological parents in rural areas.\"),\n    (\"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"living_alone_2_year\", \"She is living alone most of the time and does not mention support networks, which could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"substance_use_most_of_time\", \"She uses substances in the past four years, but this doesn't directly correlate with lower recidivism as seen in others.\"),\n    (\"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"family/relatives\", \"The examples don't show family or relatives being a significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"college enrollment\", \"She is enrolled in college, which may suggest some progress, but this isn't directly linked to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
