    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this particular case based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the key pieces of information about the individual:\n\n- Age: 20 years old.\n- Identifies as Black.\n- Arrested 3 times and convicted once.\n- Weights: The individual is currently living alone, has no jobs, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years, lived with biological mother in a 4-person household in urban area.\n- Context from the examples: Cases where the individual identifies as Black and is currently living alone had outcomes of \"YES\" for recidivism. When there were issues like no jobs or high school education (with convictions), the outcome was \"NO.\"\n\nNow, looking at each risk factor:\n\n1. **Arrested 3 times**: In examples, 0, 1, or more arrests affected outcomes significantly. Having been arrested multiple times might lead to higher recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Convicted once**: Convictions are serious, but the outcome was \"NO\" in some cases where only one conviction occurred. However, if a person has had multiple convictions, it's likely worse.\n\n3. **No jobs**: This is an important factor. People without work history tend to have higher recidivism rates because they lack stability and security, leading them away from law enforcement or other services.\n\n4. **No high school diploma/GED**: Not having a formal education can make someone more prone to criminal behavior, as there's a lower base of support for legal adulthood.\n\n5. **Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine)**: This is a serious issue that affects mental health and can lead to criminal behavior if not managed properly or if there are underlying issues like substance abuse disorders.\n\n6. **Currently living alone**: In examples, this was associated with lower recidivism rates because people in situations of low support from others face higher risks of reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together: The individual is Black, currently living alone (low), has no jobs (moderate?), no high school diploma (maybe medium?), has used drugs (high?), and a 20-year-old might not have a severe criminal history. However, having been arrested 3 times and convicted once suggests some recidivism risk.\n\nLooking at the examples: The ones where the outcome was \"YES\" involved someone living alone with no jobs, which is similar to this case. But since he's a Black individual without a high school diploma and has used drugs, his profile seems more like it would result in \"NO.\" \n\nWait, but let me double-check each factor:\n\n- **Arrested 3 times**: In the examples, having multiple arrests was associated with higher outcomes. So this is a significant risk.\n- **No jobs**: Important because without work, you're less likely to seek help from others.\n- **No high school diploma/GED**: This can lead to lower support for legal adulthood and higher recidivism.\n- **Used drugs (marijuana)**: This indicates negative mental health, which is a contributing factor.\n\nSo combining these factors: Multiple arrests, no jobs, lack of education, and drug use all point towards higher recidivism. In the examples provided where outcomes were \"YES,\" they had similar factors but different specifics. The person in this case lacks support from others (living alone) and doesn't have a stable education background, which are both associated with higher recidivism.\n\nTherefore, despite having one conviction, the combination of these risks makes it likely that his recidivism outcome would be \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested 3 times\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No jobs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of work history increases recidivism\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED\", \"medium\", \"Lower support for legal adulthood and higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Used drugs (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Negative mental health impacts behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Low support from others increases risk of reoffending\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
