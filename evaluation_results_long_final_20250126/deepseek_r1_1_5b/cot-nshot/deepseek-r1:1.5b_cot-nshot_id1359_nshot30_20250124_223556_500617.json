    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by breaking down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male who's been convicted twice. He's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 175-199 lbs. He hasn't married yet, living alone, enrolled in school now. He hasn't had any jobs during the year. Used marijuana for past four years but not depressed. Lived with his biological mother in a big city household of five people.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, especially example 28 and 30, which are both NO outcomes. In those cases, he was Black, lived alone, no jobs, used drugs (marijuana), didn't feel depressed. These factors contributed to not recidivating. \n\nIn this case, though, he's Black, living in a big city with a family of five, has some drug history but isn't extremely depressed. The only difference is that in the examples without a mental health issue, they were still NO. Since this person doesn't have a significant depression score and his mental state seems okay, it might lean towards recidivism more than not.\n\nHis lack of jobs means he didn't get any income, but that's probably less impactful than mental health issues. He used marijuana for past four years, which is unusual, but given the examples where drug use was coupled with no depression led to no recidivism, this might support it a bit. However, the absence of significant mental health problems makes me lean towards NO.\n\nThe other risk factors like not being married and living alone don't seem to directly affect recidivism unless combined with significant issues. Since he's already single, it's less likely that being in a big family would cause trouble. Plus, no job means no motivation, but without mental health, it might be harder to sustain a recidivist path.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though he has some factors (like drug use and maybe the large family), his mental health is more stable than those examples, so it's less likely to predict recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"He used marijuana for past four years, which is unusual but not extreme\"),\n    (\"depression_level\", \"medium\", \"Despite significant drug use, he hasn't shown extreme depression over the past month\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"high\", \"Lived in a household of five, which could affect his mental health and opportunities\"),\n    (\"no_motivation\", \"low\", \"No job during the year means no motivation for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"He's stable in terms of mental state without significant issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
