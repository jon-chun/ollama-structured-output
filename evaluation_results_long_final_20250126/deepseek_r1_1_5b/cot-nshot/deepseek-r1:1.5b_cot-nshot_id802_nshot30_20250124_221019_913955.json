    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, weighs 155 lbs, never married, currently living alone with a high school diploma, holds two jobs, used cocaine and marijuana in the past four years, experienced some depression during the last month, and lived with both biological parents in a 5-person household in an urban area. The goal is to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: He has been arrested once but not convicted. This could indicate a history of criminal activity or potential recidivism. Since he hasn't been convicted, it's more about the current state rather than past convictions. So, moderate weight? Maybe medium because he's facing an arrest, which is a positive sign for recidivism.\n\n2. **Weighted Reasoning**: He's a White male without a high school diploma but with two jobs and some drug use. There might be underlying issues like substance abuse or low income affecting his ability to stay away from the criminal justice system. Substance abuse increases recidivism rates, so that could contribute to higher likelihood.\n\n3. **High School Diploma**: He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This is a low education level compared to the rest of society where 90% get degrees by age 25. Higher education can influence factors like criminal behavior because educated individuals might be more likely to engage in substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Employment**: He has two jobs, which suggests a stable income and possibly better mental health support since he's employed. His employment status is positive for recidivism risk factors related to job stability and life satisfaction.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Using cocaine and marijuana is a high frequency of substance use in the past four years. Substance abuse significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest, so this should be a weight that pushes the outcome towards \"YES.\"\n\n6. **Depression Experience**: During the last month, he experienced significant depression due to feelings of despair from living with two jobs and drug issues. Depression is a major recidivism risk factor because it impairs mental health, which in turn affects criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Household Structure**: Lived with both biological parents in a 5-person household in an urban area. Urban living can be problematic due to higher crime rates, but since he's currently single and not married, that might reduce the impact of family dynamics on recidivism. However, the fact that he's lived with his parents shows there are extended social connections.\n\n8. **Gender Identity**: Identifies as White but may have specific behaviors related to race or gender in this context. It's a bit vague, but since he's White and has been arrested, it might not be a major factor unless there's evidence of racial/gender-based recidivism patterns.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- **Arrest Record**: He's facing a charge, which is positive for recidivism.\n- **Substance Use (Cocaine/Marijuana)**: His recent use has increased the risk.\n- **Employment and Education**: Two jobs and a high school diploma with potential to enroll in college. Not sure if higher education significantly impacts recidivism rates; it might, but it's not clear here since he's not in college yet.\n- **Mental Health (Depression)**: The last month of living with two jobs and substance use shows significant mental health challenges, which is a major risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, his recidivism risk factors are strong due to substance use and mental health issues. These likely outweigh other factors like arrest record or employment status. Therefore, the prediction leans towards \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The defendant has been arrested but not convicted, indicating a potential recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Cocaine/Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"His recent use of both substances significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs suggests better mental health support and job stability, which reduces recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"High School Diploma\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma is not uncommon by age 25, but without college enrollment, it may influence behavior related to criminal activities\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (Depression)\", \"high\", \"The last month of living with two jobs and substance use indicates significant mental health challenges affecting recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
