    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the three-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The person is an 18-year-old Asian Pacific Islander male. Let me break down his risk factors.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted once, which is a significant negative factor. That shows he's experienced some form of criminal behavior, which I guess increases the chance of recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches, not married, living alone\u2014probably makes sense for someone with criminal history to be in an isolated situation without kids or friends around. His high school diploma but enrolled in a 2-year college means he might have some educational issues that could affect him.\n\nHe holds one job and hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's clean on that aspect. He didn't feel depressed either, which is good because depressed people might not need to worry about recidivism as much.\n\nLooking at the examples given, cases where he had high risk factors like prior convictions or substance abuse usually resulted in higher recidivism rates. But this case doesn't have that\u2014more of a clean slate but with some criminal history.\n\nHis age is young, and living alone might make him more vulnerable because there's less support for rebuilding his life after serving his sentence. However, the examples didn't show this scenario clearly.\n\nIn the previous examples, even with high risk factors like drug use or substance abuse (but not here), recidivism was low. Here, no substance use issues, and he's in a stable situation.\n\nSo putting it all together: prior convictions are bad, but they're only two each way. No substance abuse, living alone is good. High school diploma isn't the highest, but enrollment is lower than some others. He holds one job, which might not be as bad.\n\nOverall, he's in a good situation with no significant negative factors besides some criminal history. So I think his recidivism chance should be moderate rather than high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"two arrests in two years indicate a significant criminal history that may affect recidivism\"),\n    (\"high School_Diploma\", \"medium\", \"the person has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating potential issues with education or career path\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use\", \"low\", \"no substance abuse indicates less risk of relapse despite the criminal history\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"good\", \"residing alone reduces vulnerability to recidivism compared to living in a crowded household\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
