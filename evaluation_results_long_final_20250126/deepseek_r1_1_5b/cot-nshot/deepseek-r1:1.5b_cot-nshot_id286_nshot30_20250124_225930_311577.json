    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors and the provided examples. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors from the case:\n\n1. **Arms**: A 22-year-old male identifies as White, has never been married, is currently living alone, has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college.\n2. **Family Background**: Lives with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. Considers God to be involved.\n3. **Drug Use**: Has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n4. **Mood**: Lived with parents in a rural area and feels down after the past month without feeling depressed.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples provided:\n\nAll the examples are negative outcomes (NO) except for example #29, which also predicts NO. The main characteristics of these examples include:\n\n- Living in a household that includes foster or adoptive parents.\n- Having drug use history and depression-related mood issues.\n- Not being married, living alone, high school diploma, enrolled in college.\n\nIn the given case:\n\n- **Family Background**: Lives with foster parents (household size 3).\n- **Mood**: Lived with parents (rural area) and felt depressed after a month without feeling better. This seems like a negative outcome.\n- **Drug Use**: Significant drug use history.\n- **Not married, living alone, high school diploma, enrolled in college**: All positive risk factors except for being not married or living alone.\n\nNow, considering the weights from examples: in example #29, the weight was low because he lived with a foster parent and felt depressed. The case here also has similar features\u2014lived with foster parents and is feeling down after months without feeling better. This aligns with the low weight category.\n\nPutting it all together, this case shares many characteristics that would lead to a negative recidivism outcome. Therefore, based on the provided examples, the prediction for recidivism would be NO.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lived_with_foster_parents\", \"low\", \" lived with foster parents and has been feeling down after months without feeling better\"),\n    (\"drugs_used\", \"medium\", \" significant drug use history led to negative mood\"),\n    (\"mood_state\", \"low\", \" lived with parents in rural area and feelings of depression after a month without improvement\"),\n    (\"not_married\", \"low\", \" does not live with his family members\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \" lives independently\"),\n    (\"highschool_diploma\", \"medium\", \" high school education but may lack job stability\"),\n    (\"college_enrolled\", \"medium\", \" enrolled in college but could face issues like high costs or lack of income\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 0\n}",
