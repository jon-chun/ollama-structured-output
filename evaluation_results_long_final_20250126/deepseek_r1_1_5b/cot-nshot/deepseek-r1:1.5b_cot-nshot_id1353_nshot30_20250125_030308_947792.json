    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the person in question: a 21-year-old Black male arrested 3 times without conviction. He's 5'9\" and weighs 170 lbs. He hasn't been married yet, isn't living with his biological mother in a rural area, has a GED but not enrolled in college, worked 3 jobs, has used marijuana, and had some down time. At his young age.\n\nFrom the examples provided, I should analyze each risk factor individually and assign a weight (low, medium, high) based on their likelihood of contributing to recidivism. Then combine these weights to predict the outcome with confidence.\n\nStarting with substance use: He used marijuana in the past four years and had down time. This seems concerning because substance use can lead to recidivism, especially if he's not living alone or having issues. That might increase his risk.\n\nNext, family dynamics: He's in a rural area with biological mother as a parent, possibly strained family relations. That could affect support systems, which are crucial for reintegration after-arrest. Strained relationships might reduce recidivism because of less support and lower trust.\n\nEconomic factors: He hasn't been employed for 3 years but has worked part-time jobs. Economic instability or lack of income might make him more likely to seek help or stay away from the law, increasing recidivism risk.\n\nAge-related issues: At his young age, he's about 21 and hasn't been married yet. This could mean limited support networks during recovery and possibly higher risk as he may need more time alone.\n\nFamily members' support is crucial\u2014no biological father or other family members present. He might rely on others for support, which isn't stable, adding to his recidivism chances.\n\nHealth factors: No specific health issues mentioned, but since he's a 21-year-old, maybe not fully fit yet. Inadequate healthcare could also contribute as he might seek help less readily.\n\nLegal status: Not convicted but could still be in a situation where he might face re-arrest without any prior negative experiences.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are significant and likely to contribute to recidivism. His substance use, family dynamics, economic stability, lack of support, and other potential issues all point towards increased risk. Without a solid case against these risks, the likelihood is high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years and significant down time increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"low\", \"Rural area with biological mother may reduce support systems and family relationships impact\"),\n    (\"economic_stability\", \"medium\", \"Work history and part-time jobs suggest economic challenges affecting reintegration\"),\n    (\"ageRelated_inevability\", \"high\", \"Young age at 21 without prior negative experiences increases risk despite lack of married status\"),\n    (\"familySupport_gaps\", \"low\", \"No present biological father or other family members can provide stable support, increasing reliance on others\"),\n    (\"health_condition\", \"medium\", \"Not detailed but might affect healthcare access and seeking help more readily\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
