    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the case to predict recidivism for this 21-year-old Black male.\n\nFirst, the person is black, which might influence recidivism rates because race can play a role in criminal behavior. That's probably a low factor.\n\nHe was arrested twice and convicted. Convictions are serious, so that would likely increase recidivism risk. Medium factor here since it's more severe than no convictions but less than many convictions.\n\nMarried and living with spouse: being married might have some positive aspects for reoffending, like support network or lower stress, but I'm not sure how significant that is. Maybe low to medium.\n\nHigh school diploma without college completion: This could be a risk factor because less education often leads to higher reoffending rates. So high here since it's missing.\n\nNo jobs during the year: Without work experience, that's definitely a low risk factor because no prior criminal activity would mean lower chance of reoffending.\n\nNot using drugs in past four years or feeling depressed over a month: Not engaging in drug use and not feeling depressed are both positive factors. So these would be medium since they're not severe issues but contribute to overall well-being, which helps with recidivism.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a family of size 4: Being raised by parents is generally seen as supportive, so this might moderate recidivism risk. Medium factor here too.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has some support from his spouse and was convicted multiple times. However, he doesn't have a lot of criminal history, no education beyond high school, and a stable family. So overall, these factors don't combine to significantly increase recidivism. It seems more likely that this person would reenter the criminal justice system than not. Therefore, I'd predict \"NO\" for recidivism.\n</think>\n\nThe case involves a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested twice and convicted. Despite being married and living with his spouse, he lacks prior convictions or a high school diploma, yet is stable in his family life. The negative factors include no criminal history, lack of education, and no substance use. These are mitigated by family stability and a positive environment. Based on this reasoning, the prediction for recidivism is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"dived\", \"low\", \"convictions are more severe than no convictions but not as frequent as many\"],\n    (\"single\", \"medium\", \"family support moderate\"),\n    (\"nojob\", \"low\", \"no prior criminal history reduces risk\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"medium\", \"no substance use and low depression contribute positively\"),\n    (\"famsize\", \"medium\", \"well-off family structure supports reoffending\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
