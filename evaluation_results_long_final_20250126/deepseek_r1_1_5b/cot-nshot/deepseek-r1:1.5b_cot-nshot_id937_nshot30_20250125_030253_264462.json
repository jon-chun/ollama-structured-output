    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case for recidivism prediction. The person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because it shows she might have substance abuse issues or past criminal history.\n\nShe weighs 125-149 lbs, indicating she's probably of average weight for her age. She's married, living with her spouse, so she's part of a couple who could influence recidivism through family dynamics and possibly support systems. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which is a significant factor because education is linked to recidivism rates.\n\nShe holds one job during the year but hasn't mentioned any other employment history. The most recent crime she's involved in was a gun-related incident last month, which suggests past criminal activity that could be relevant.\n\nHer financial situation isn't clear, and she has used drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014so this is another risk to consider. She's lived with her biological mother in a rural area for four years, which might mean she's living alone or with family who could affect her behavior.\n\nShe's experiencing depression most of the time during the past month, which is a significant emotional factor. The lack of support systems and possible strained relationships could contribute to recidivism risks.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, cases where someone has substance abuse history (arrests and convictions) or high levels of substance use tend to have higher recidivism rates. Here, she's convicted twice, which is a strong indicator. Also, living alone with her spouse might increase risk due to family dynamics. Marital issues and emotional distress from depression could also contribute.\n\nThe examples often found recidivism when someone has substance abuse history or lacks education. This person fits both categories\u2014convictions (substance use) and no high school diploma/EDG. The lack of support systems, living alone, and the impact of depression are additional risks that compound the recidivism likelihood.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014the criminal history, lack of education, emotional distress, and possibly strained relationships\u2014it's likely that she will reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been convicted twice in the past two years, indicating potential criminal history.\",\n    \"Marital issues, emotional stress from depression, and living alone with her spouse may further increase risk.\"),\n    (\"lack of high school diploma\", \"medium\", \"No GED certificate indicates a lack of education, which is linked to higher recidivism rates.\",\n    \"She has no high school diploma but has not mentioned substance abuse history, so this factor is moderate.\",\n    \"Marital issues and emotional distress from depression may also contribute.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
