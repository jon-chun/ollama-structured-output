    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 20-year-old white male is likely to rearrest for his next three years. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old who just got convicted of crime. He has a high school diploma but is now in college\u20142-year program. That might open up more opportunities, which could reduce recidivism because people with higher education often have better opportunities to reoffend later on. But wait, sometimes even educated people can have issues if they're in trouble.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That seems normal for a person his age; not too heavy or short that he might be at risk. He's never married and is living alone, which could mean less social stress and potentially lower recidivism because of less exposure to societal pressures.\n\nHe's been arrested once before and convicted. That should be a big red flag indicating serious issues. Convictions are often associated with higher recidivism rates compared to convictions without punishment or prior arrest. So that might make him more likely to reoffend.\n\nHis background includes holding two jobs, which shows he has some work experience but hasn't accumulated any significant criminal history beyond the previous offense. He's lived with his biological mother in a 4-person household in an urban area for a few years now. That could mean some strain on that relationship and possibly more stress, which might affect recidivism.\n\nHe uses both marijuana and cocaine and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is concerning because substance abuse can be a big factor in recidivism. If he's heavily into drugs without any immediate positive results, it might indicate he's struggling with addiction or has other issues that make him more prone to reoffending.\n\nHis household size was 4 before he got convicted. That seems small\u2014maybe he's living with friends and family who know him well. Small households can sometimes mean more stress and social interactions, which could be linked to recidivism risk.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of being charged with crime, is in college, has significant substance abuse issues, but not had any positive outcomes beyond that. The small household size might also play a role. So his overall profile suggests he's at a higher risk for reoffending in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction history\", \"high\", \"A history of criminal convictions often indicates serious issues that may lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"education level (2-year college)\", \"medium\", \"Having a degree and now enrolling in college might open more opportunities, but it doesn't necessarily mean lower recidivism rate as people with higher education can face different risks based on other factors.\"),\n    (\"family dynamics in a small 4-person household\", \"A small household size may contribute to social stress and potential recidivism risk due to strained relationships.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse (marijuana, cocaine; no depression for past month)\", \" substance use is often linked to recidivism, but significant addiction issues without immediate positive outcomes suggest higher risk.\"),\n    (\"family living situation in urban area with small household\", \" Small family size and possibly strained social relationships may contribute to recidivism risks in an urban environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
