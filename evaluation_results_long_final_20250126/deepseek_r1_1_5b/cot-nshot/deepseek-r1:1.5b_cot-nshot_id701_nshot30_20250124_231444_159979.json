    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how I approached this case. The user provided a detailed scenario with various risk factors for predicting recidivism over three years. My task was to assign weights to each factor and then determine the overall prediction.\n\nFirst, I looked at each risk factor one by one. For the female in question, who is 20, White, has lived with her parents, high school diploma, four jobs, no convictions, never married, not living in a rural area, no drug use, and no feeling depressed since last month\u2014these all point towards possible negative behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nI considered each factor's likelihood. Having high school might mean some education, but without criminal history, it's a bit tricky. Four jobs indicate she's stable, which usually helps. Not living in a rural area suggests a less stressful environment. No drug use and depression since last month suggest fewer triggers for reoffending.\n\nPutting these together, I thought the overall risk was high because all factors lean towards her staying active and not committing again. However, I didn't feel 100% certain, so I assigned a medium weight to each factor. \n\nIn the end, after evaluating all factors, the recidivism outcome was predicted as NO with a confidence level of 65%, considering some risk but no clear indication of high reoffending potential.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lived_with_parents\", \"low\", \"She is in a household of size 5, rural area.
