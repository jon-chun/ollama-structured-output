    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old male case based on his risk factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White 19-year-old living with both biological parents in a household of size 6. He's been convicted 8 times and has a high school diploma but isn't yet in college. He's got two jobs during the year, which is good for stability. He used to use marijuana and cocaine, which are known substances that often lead to recidivism because they can cause mental health issues and addiction problems.\n\nHis weight of 19-year-old male with White identity sounds like it would be on a higher risk factor scale since he's more likely to engage in substance abuse. But his high school diploma isn't an issue here, so that might mitigate some of the risks from educational attainment.\n\nHe has no current enrollment at college and hasn't been married, which is positive for family stability. His weight of 60% probably means he's somewhere between high risk factors like substance use and economic strain but more manageable than others. He's lived with his parents in a small household, maybe not the most stable living situation. However, he has two jobs, which could provide some financial support.\n\nHe's been convicted multiple times, which is a strong indicator of past negative behavior leading to potential recidivism. His substance use patterns\u2014both marijuana and cocaine\u2014strongly suggest a higher risk because they can lead to addiction and mental health issues in the future.\n\nHis weight of 60% might mean he's on a moderate risk, but with multiple convictions and heavy substance use, it could push him towards more severe recidivism. His weight of 40% likely refers to his age and maybe other factors like living conditions affecting his ability to stay stable.\n\nConsidering all these points\u2014convictions, substance abuse, high school diploma not being an issue, no current enrollment, two jobs, small family size\u2014the overall risk seems significant enough that it might lead him to rearrest within 3 years. Even though he's a low risk in some areas (no college, high school diploma), the multiple convictions and substance use add layers of concern.\n\nSo, I think his recidivism outcome is likely \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has significant concerns from multiple conviction history, substance abuse, and potentially lower education. Despite no enrollment, two jobs support stability but still carry risks of reoffending due to substance use. His weight of 60% suggests a higher risk, leading to a moderate prediction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"higher than average due to multiple convictions and substance abuse\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"excludes potential low recidivism factors like mental health issues\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"low risk in terms of high school diploma but moderate with age and other factors\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"small household may affect living stability\"),\n    (\"jobs\", \"moderate\", \"provides financial support but not economic hardship\"),\n    (\"current_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"low risk for immediate enrollment issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
