    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old White male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old, which is within the age range that has been shown to correlate with higher recidivism rates. He's white, and while race can influence recidivism in some cases, in this example, it seems like his background isn't the main concern here because other factors are more significant.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted, which suggests he had some form of prior criminal history. His weight is 155 lbs, which might indicate a sedentary lifestyle if he's young and not married or living alone. He's a single individual without any previous crimes, so his recidivism factors might be more influenced by other aspects.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college yet. That might affect his education access, which could influence future behavior. However, since he's 21, maybe he hasn't had as much opportunity to develop new skills or change his lifestyle on his own yet.\n\nHis family is of low socioeconomic status, but again, economic background might not be the primary factor here because other factors like past convictions and substance use are more directly linked to recidivism.\n\nHe's single and currently living alone. This could mean he has no support system around him, which might lead to higher recidivism rates. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't shown any signs of dependence or dependence on it now. His mental state isn't severely depressed, so that shouldn't be a major factor.\n\nHis household size is 3, which could mean he has a younger sibling or parent, adding more family dynamics to his life. The number of jobs he held during the past year is none, which might suggest he's not in any stable employment situation.\n\nPutting it all together, his recidivism factors seem to include his high school education (medium), previous convictions (high), living alone (low), and low substance use (medium). However, since his background isn't heavily influenced by his race or socioeconomic status, the primary risk factors are the ones that matter most in this example.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, when a person had a high school diploma, no jobs, and was single but lived with his parents without any issues, the recidivism outcome was \"NO.\" So, combining all these elements\u2014his education (medium), past convictions (high), living alone (low), and low substance use\u2014it seems like he's not at risk for recidivism. Therefore, the prediction is NO.\n</think>\n\nThe person has a high school diploma but isn't in college yet. He was arrested once and convicted, which indicates prior criminal history. His family size and living situation don't show signs of dependency or severe mental health issues. The key factors here are his previous convictions (high), education level (medium), living status (single), and substance use (low). However, these aren't the primary risk factors in this example. Based on the provided examples, especially those where recidivism was \"NO,\" the prediction is that he won't rearrest.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high school diploma\", \"medium\", \"previous convictions have a significant impact\"),\n    (\"no college\", \"medium\", \"low education level and lack of higher education lead to lower risk\"),\n    (\"single\", \"low\", \"lived in an unfamiliar environment without support\"),\n    (\"low substance use\", \"medium\", \"substance use doesn't correlate with recidivism here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
