    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old Black male who's been in jail twice. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, he's a Black person, age 20, hasn't married yet, living alone. He has a GED but not a high school diploma, only a high school one, and no college enrollment. He's had one job during the year, didn't use any drugs in four years, and isn't depressed. His family is rural, lived with his dad for three years.\n\nLooking at the examples given, I see that people living alone in rural areas with a GED often don't get recidivated if they're not depressed. The other factors like jobs, not using drugs, and being not depressed seem neutral or positive but don't necessarily lead to recidivism.\n\nThe examples where he was an off-white person didn't have these issues. But wait, this case is black, which might indicate a different outcome because being Black can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if other factors like family dynamics or cultural influences are at play.\n\nHe's not been in jail twice before, so that's 0 recs. The previous examples showed that people who were Black and had certain conditions (like low education) didn't have a high chance of recidivism. But since this is a new case with no prior data, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nConsidering the factors: he's rural, not married, single, has a GED but not higher, no drugs, no depression. These are all positive except possibly living alone, which usually is good. The absence of education issues and lack of substance use make me lean towards no recidivism. But I'm not 100% certain because the examples don't cover Black individuals as much.\n\nI'll go with \"NO\" for his recidivism outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black\", \"medium\", \"the case is unique and lacks context on racial correlates in recidivism without specific data\"),\n    (\"off-white\", \"low\", \"other examples show that off-whites may differ, but this is a new case\"),\n    (\"no previous recs\", \"low\", \"previous examples with similar conditions have lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"lived alone\", \"medium\", \"rural area and family dynamics can influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"GED only\", \"low\", \"the cases given don't include GED-only individuals as much as higher education does\"),\n    (\"no substance use\", \"low\", \"no drug history, which is favorable without more info\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"medium\", \"mild mood but not severe enough to suggest recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
