    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the three-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let's start by analyzing each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He hasn't been arrested yet but has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a four-year college. That means he didn't graduate from high school but is now in college, which could indicate some risk of reoffending, especially if he's still trying to establish himself.\n\nNext, he's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 155 lbs. His weight seems normal for his age, so no issue there. He hasn't been married yet, which might mean less family influence on his behavior or actions.\n\nHe's currently living alone and has a history of living with biological parents in a rural area. That could affect his access to resources and support systems, which are crucial for recidivism prediction. Also, he used substances like marijuana and has had instances where he felt down, suggesting potential issues with substance abuse.\n\nHis family background as a rural person might mean less availability for family support or supervision, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. He's not just single; he has a biological parent who might have been involved in his behavior, adding another layer of risk.\n\nThe recidivism prediction is based on how these factors stack up and interact. His educational background being in college could mean he's facing some challenges, but since he hasn't used drugs or substances in the past four years, maybe the focus is more on other aspects like substance use and living alone.\n\nHowever, his weight and height are normal, which might not be a significant factor here. The primary risks seem to revolve around his family structure, living alone, substance abuse, and possibly other personal issues that haven't been addressed yet. These factors could increase the recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering all these points, it's plausible that this individual has some risk of reoffending, especially if he continues with substance use or faces challenges from a single family member.\n</think>\n\nThe case involves an 19-year-old male who is currently living alone, has not been arrested, and has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. He is White, which might reflect his background as a student. His weight seems normal for his age, so this factor doesn't appear to be a significant risk. The key factors are his family background (rural lifestyle), living alone, substance abuse history, and potential issues with family supervision or support systems.\n\nBased on these considerations, the outcome is likely \"NO.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"is_single\", \"low\", \"Living alone seems to be a significant risk factor as single individuals may face more challenges in reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Rural lifestyle could limit access to family support and supervision, increasing the likelihood of substance use or other behaviors affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"medium\", \"He has used substances like marijuana in the past four years and has had instances where he felt down, indicating potential issues with substance abuse impacting his behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
