    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest in a 3-year period. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once. Being Hispanic might influence recidivism rates because of cultural and family dynamics at home. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, which could mean she's part of a household or has support from a partner. Marriage status often correlates with better access to education and employment opportunities, reducing recidivism chances. So this factor seems moderate but somewhat positive for recidivism.\n\nShe's currently in school, so maybe she's more motivated or has time to seek out opportunities that would help her reintegrate into society. This could be a significant factor, leaning towards high risk because better education and skills might mean less reoffending.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is good because drug use can be a strong predictor of recidivism. But I'm not certain if non-drug abusers are more likely to reciditate than someone who hasn't engaged with drugs recently.\n\nShe's not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she's emotionally stable. depressed individuals often have higher rates of reoffending because they may struggle with motivation or make poor decisions despite their best efforts. So this factor is moderate but doesn't directly contribute to recidivism risk.\n\nThe household size was 4, which might mean more family members or less independence, potentially affecting her ability to handle responsibilities and seek out opportunities for reintegration. This could be a moderate factor because it's about stability, not necessarily the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her current situation, but without more context on how this ties into recidivism rates, I can't assign much weight to this as a risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: being Hispanic suggests some factors related to recidivism, she's married and in education which helps, non-drug use is good, and the household size might be somewhat negative. \n\nI think most of the factors except maybe her gender or ethnicity influence moderately, but overall, this individual seems in a better position emotionally and legally for reintegration. So the prediction should be \"NO\" because she's likely to have lower recidivism rates over three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"family_status\", \"moderate\", \"married and living with spouse supports better opportunities\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"high\", \"currently in school provides motivation and time for reintegration\"),\n    (\"emotional_stability\", \"moderate\", \"no feelings of depression over past month suggests stability\"),\n    (\"drugs_use\", \"low\", \"non-current drug use indicates less motivation to reoffend\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"moderate\", \"small household might affect family dynamics and independence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
