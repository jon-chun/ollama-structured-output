    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male based on the given information. He's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but hasn't convicted. He's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He never married yet and is living alone. He's in school now, has held one job during the year, hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. At a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five, which is urban. God isn't mentioned here.\n\nFirst, I should consider his criminal behavior. He's been arrested once but not convicted, so it's just one offense. That might seem low, but sometimes people commit crimes to feel guilty. Then he's living alone and in a small household with his parents, which could limit opportunities for recidivism.\n\nNext, he hasn't used drugs or been depressed. That's positive aspects, but I don't know how significant that is compared to other factors like environment or personal circumstances.\n\nHis previous residence was urban, so maybe that has an impact on recidivism rates in different areas. But even though it's urban, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be more likely to reoffend there.\n\nThe fact that he's a teenager might give him some advantages because they're younger and have less time spent with others. Maybe he's less likely to move away or leave support systems.\n\nHe's in school now, so if something happens while he's studying, it might delay recidivism. But again, factors like family issues or economic instability could still affect him.\n\nSince he's been arrested once but hasn't convicted, his recidivism history is short-term. That usually means lower risk because there's less time to develop criminal behavior.\n\nBut I should also consider the environment where he lives. Living alone in a small household might limit opportunities for reoffending compared to families with more support systems and opportunities.\n\nThe fact that he was raised in an urban area, even if he moved back now, may have some effects on recidivism rates. However, it's still possible for him to move away or return home later.\n\nHis lack of substance use and depression is positive but doesn't address criminal behavior directly. It might affect mental health, which could influence criminal behavior in the future, but not necessarily his current risk.\n\nPutting this all together, I think his recidivism risk isn't very high because he's young, has some academic support, and has a stable environment with support systems. However, urban living still has some local effects that might slightly increase his risk compared to rural areas. But overall, the factors point towards a low probability of rearrest in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"lived_with_both_biological_parents\", \"low\", \"He lived with both parents in a small urban household, limiting opportunities for recidivism compared to families with more support systems\"),\n    (\"stayed_in_school\", \"medium\", \"His academic status provides some advantage as he may have less time spent moving away from the environment and facing recidivist potential\"),\n    (\"lived_alone\", \"low\", \"This alone might increase his risk slightly in an urban area compared to rural areas, but overall lower than other factors\"),\n    (\"no_previous_drugs\", \"medium\", \"His lack of substance use may reduce immediate negative impacts on criminal behavior and mental health),\n    (\"not_felless_over_morning\", \"low\", \"His current state doesn't indicate severe emotional distress that would influence recidivism directly\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
