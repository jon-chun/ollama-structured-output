    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 20 years old. As per my knowledge, people under 25 are considered high-risk because they have fewer opportunities for recidivism. So I'll assign them a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, gender: They're white. From what I remember, race isn't typically a significant factor in recidivism rates across most populations. So I'll keep it as medium.\n\nMarital status: Currently living alone. This is a positive sign because single individuals are generally less likely to reoffend after being released or reintegrating. So this will be a high risk factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not college ready. Lower education levels usually mean higher recidivism rates because fewer opportunities for learning about the law and criminal behavior. I'll assign them medium risk.\n\nJob history: No prior jobs since they've been arrested once. This is a red flag because someone who's never worked before has less time to learn and might be more likely to reoffend upon release. High risk factor here.\n\nMarital status again: Currently living alone, which reinforces the idea of being single and low risk. So another high risk factor.\n\nReligion: No information on religious beliefs. Since many factors like religion don't play a role in recidivism rates, I'll assign this as medium risk.\n\nPast drug use: Last four years, used marijuana. This is concerning because marijuana has been linked to various serious issues like addiction and crime. It's a high risk factor.\n\nMood: Not feeling depressed for the past month. While mood can affect behavior, it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates. So medium risk here.\n\nFamily life: lived with parents in a small rural household. This is a stable environment, which is favorable for reintegration and lower recidivism rates. High risk factor again.\n\nOverall assessment: The individual has multiple high-risk factors (living alone, living alone, current marital status, not feeling depressed) but one low risk factor (age). The combined impact of these risks makes me lean towards a moderate risk rather than the highest.\n</think>\n\n{\"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is a positive sign as it reduces reintegration chances\"),\n    (\"not feeling depressed over the past month\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate better integration and lower reoffending likelihood\"),\n    (\"high school diploma and not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Lower education levels limit learning potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"current marital status (single)\", \"high\", \"Single status reduces risk as fewer opportunities for reintegrating\"),\n    (\"previous drug use (marijuana, last four years)\", \"high\", \"Marijuana is a significant risk factor linked to addiction and crime\")\n], \"prediction\": \"NO\", \"confidence\": 65}",
