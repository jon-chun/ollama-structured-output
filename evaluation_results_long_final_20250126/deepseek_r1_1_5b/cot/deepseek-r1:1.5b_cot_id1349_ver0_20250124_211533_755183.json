    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor for this individual's recidivism risk. The goal is to predict whether she would rearrest within three years.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female who has been arrested 10 times and convicted. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might make her more at risk. She's living alone without a partner, so that could be a significant factor. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years or shown signs of depression over the last month.\n\nShe has two jobs during the year and a household size of 4, which is probably not too large. She considered her biological mother as her primary caregiver in an urban area, which might influence her behavior. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nLooking at the risk factors:\n\n1. Lack of education or GED: Since she has never completed high school or GED, this seems relevant. The likelihood is probably higher because fewer people with such qualifications can afford college or work legally.\n2. Living alone without a partner: This could be risky in many places, but since it's an urban area and the household size is 4, maybe not as severe. However, living alone might lead to more isolation, which is a risk factor.\n3. No substance use or depression symptoms: These are personal factors that don't directly relate to criminal behavior, so their impact would be minimal.\n\nNow, weighing these:\n\n- Lack of education is a major risk. She's 18, so her educational background might not reflect past criminal behavior, especially if she didn't attend school before being arrested.\n- Living alone without a partner could contribute, but it's less severe in an urban area with four people.\n- No substance use or depression: These are personal and can affect mood, which might influence decision-making, but their direct impact on recidivism is minimal.\n\nSo, the most significant risk factor here is her lack of education. The other factors are either less impactful or irrelevant.\n\nPutting it all together, this seems like a high-risk individual for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"Lack of educational qualifications may negatively influence recidivism risk.\",\n     \"People with limited education often have lower recidivism rates compared to the general population.\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner can increase risk, especially in urban areas where single individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\",\n     \"This individual's living situation aligns with higher risks associated with being single and living in an urban environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
