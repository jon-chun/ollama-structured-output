    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to rearrest after three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old Black woman who has been arrested four times. She's never been married or lived alone, and she's single now. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might be a risk factor because people without those degrees are more likely to commit crimes, especially if they're exposed to different environments.\n\nShe has never had a job, but that's probably an issue for someone with no previous experience. Also, she hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That\u2019s interesting because drug use can lead to criminal behavior, but her mood isn\u2019t improving, which might make it harder for her to stay motivated.\n\nShe was raised by her biological mother in a household of six, which probably means there's some systemic issues affecting her development. She considers God involved with her personal life, so that could add another layer of vulnerability or guidance.\n\nLooking at the factors:\n\n1. **No Previous Employment**: This seems like a significant risk because it's an early indicator of potential criminal behavior without any prior experience.\n2. **No Drug Use**: Even though she used marijuana in the past four years, the lack of recent use and her current state might still pose a risk. People who struggle with substance use often commit crimes again.\n3. **No Depression**: If she had been feeling depressed before, that could affect her motivation to change or stay away from criminal activities.\n\nI'm not sure about the impact of these factors together. It's possible she's at high risk because of her lack of experience and potential stressors like substance use and depression. Also, her background in a family setting might have some positive aspects, but without any previous exposure, it could still be challenging to recidivate.\n\nI'm leaning towards the conclusion that yes, with all these factors contributing to a high risk, she has a good chance of rearresting after three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"no previous employment\", \"low\", \"She lacks experience in criminal activity without prior exposure, which is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"no drug use\", \"medium\", \"Her recent drug use and potential depression state may still pose a risk of reintegration into crime\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"low\", \"While there's some stress from substance use, her lack of previous depression might mitigate this impact\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"She was raised by her biological mother in an urban area with a household of six, potentially introducing systemic issues affecting development\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
