    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has given a detailed profile of someone who's been arrested once and is now facing rearrest in three years. They've provided several risk factors with textual reasoning. My job is to assign weights to each factor, predict whether they'll rearrest, and provide confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor one by one. Starting with age: 21, not a high risk. Next, gender identity\u2014white isn't a big deal here. Then, education level: high school diploma plus college is average but not severe. Marital status: single living alone sounds familiar with some recidivism rates.\n\nNext, previous convictions: only one, which could be a low risk indicator if other similar cases don't result in rearrest. Employment history: no job during the year, maybe low risk. Substance use: no past drug use. Depression: not felt over the last month, so possibly low.\n\nFamily dynamics: lived with both parents in a small family\u2014some people face issues there. God's influence: this is interesting; it adds some cultural or spiritual factors to consider. Lastly, living alone and age being young means they might be at a vulnerable spot.\n\nNow, weighing each factor. Age and gender don't add much. Marital status single living alone could moderate risk. Previous convictions are rare, so that's medium. Employment is unknown but low. Substance use doesn't apply here. Depression not mentioned, maybe lower than others. Family dynamics seem like a plus. Living alone at 21 might be a high because it's a young age and single living.\n\nFor prediction: Considering all these factors together, especially the family dynamics being an indicator of support, but without other significant risks, I think rearrest is possible but not certain. The confidence level should reflect that uncertainty with a moderate weight.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with risk_factors as an array and include the prediction and confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Being single and living alone is generally a positive factor in recidivism, especially at this young age.\"),\n    (\"Family dynamics\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4\u2014factors like support, community, or cultural influences can reduce rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Being single and living alone is generally a positive factor in recidivism, especially at this young age.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"unknown\", \"No previous job during the year suggests a low risk of employment issues affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\" substance use\", \"not applicable\", \"No past drug use indicates a lower risk for substance-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the last month is a positive indicator, as it reduces stress and anxiety that could affect recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"average\", \"A high school diploma plus college suggests an average level of education, which may increase risk compared to higher education but is generally manageable.), \n    (\"Previous convictions\", \"medium\", \"Only one conviction in three years indicates a low risk of future repeat convictions.\"),\n    (\"Gender identity\", \"low\", \"Being white doesn't significantly impact recidivism rates in this context.\"),\n    (\"God's influence\", \"high\", \"This adds cultural or spiritual factors to consider, which can influence recidivism risk moderately.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
