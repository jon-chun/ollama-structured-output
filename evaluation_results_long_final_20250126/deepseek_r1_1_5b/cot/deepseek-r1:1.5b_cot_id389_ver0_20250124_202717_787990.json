    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's recidivism over three years. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male from a white background who has been arrested once. He's not married and lives alone, which might indicate lower risk of coming back. His height is 5'10\" and weight 165 lbs\u2014moderate to low body size. He doesn't have a college degree and isn't currently enrolled, which could be associated with less education and higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's from a rural area where he lives with his biological mother in a household of four. That's a small family, which might not contribute much to criminal behavior but is something to note. His background as non-caste (I assume) suggests a more stable environment, possibly lower risk factors.\n\nHe never used drugs in the past four years and hasn't been depressed over the last month. These are positive indicators\u2014low risks for recidivism.\n\nHis jobs during the year range from construction workers to teachers, but he's not employed yet. His age makes him a vulnerable individual who might have less criminal history, which is another point towards lower risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: his age and background, living alone in a small family, non-caste identity, stable environment, lack of substance use, and absence of depression are all positive aspects that could be linked to lower recidivism rates. His arrest once might have started an ongoing pattern but hasn't resulted in a repeat within three years.\n\nPutting it together, the risks seem low because these factors either support criminal behavior or indicate better safety conditions. Therefore, predicting no recidivism seems appropriate with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"His age and background suggest a lower risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"background\", \"low\", \"A non-caste identity indicates a more stable environment and potentially lower recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"stable environment\", \"low\", \"Living in a rural area with his biological mother in a small family may provide better safety conditions\"),\n    (\"lack of substance use\", \"low\", \"His history of not using drugs suggests less risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"absence of depression\", \"low\", \"No recent indicators of depression suggest lower recidivism risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
