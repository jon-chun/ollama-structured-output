    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed scenario about a young Hispanic male who's been arrested three times without conviction. He wants me to assess his risk factors for rearrest in the next three years using specific criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the information given. He's a 19-year-old Hispanic with an urban home, never married, living alone. He has a GED, no college, held one job, hasn't used drugs or felt depressed. His upbringing was with his parents in a household of size six, and he considers God unrelated.\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor. Age seems low (19), which might mean higher risk. Being Hispanic could be an advantage, but maybe not enough if others have lower risks. Urban vs rural? Maybe a micro area complicates things. No past convictions\u2014this is a strong point against recidivism. Number of jobs: one job without driving, no issue here.\n\nMarriveness: never married. Age: 19 might be an outlier in being single. Living alone could mean less support for courts or family issues. Home size six isn't too big but maybe not enough to affect his behavior. No drug use or depression? That's a positive aspect.\n\nLooking at other factors like substance abuse, mental health\u2014none mentioned. Physical: no info given. Finances: no specifics.\n\nPutting it all together: low risk for driving due to single status and limited support, medium risk for substance use since none reported, but high risk because of no prior convictions. Wait, he's never convicted yet, which is a big plus against recidivism.\n\nWait, the user wants a prediction on rearrest in three years. Based on his lack of prior convictions, high risk? Or maybe low risk due to living alone and not being supported by family?\n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards medium risk because he's single and has limited support from family. But since he's never convicted, that's an advantage.\n\nWait, no prior convictions mean lower recidivism. So maybe low risk despite living alone? Or high risk because of his substance use?\n\nHe hasn't reported substance abuse, but maybe he doesn't feel depressed. That might mitigate the recidivism risk. \n\nSo overall, perhaps medium risk. But since he's a 19-year-old with limited support, maybe lower. Maybe low risk.\n\nWait, no prior convictions\u2014low risk for driving and possibly less likely to use drugs or substance abuse without reporting. So maybe low risk.\n\nBut living alone might make him more vulnerable if someone takes advantage of that. I'm unsure.\n\nI think the best prediction is yes but with a high confidence level because he's single, lacks family support, and has no substance use reported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"single status\", \"low\", \"the lack of family support and limited social environment makes it harder to engage in criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"lack of substance abuse reporting\", \"low\", \"if there is any evidence of substance abuse, it would be important to report\"),\n    (\"limited social support or family presence\", \"low\", \"single status often leads to a lack of close social bonds and family presence which can affect recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"no prior convictions\", \"high\", \"the lack of convictions in the past reduces the likelihood of recidivism despite any personal circumstances affecting his behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
