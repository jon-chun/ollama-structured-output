    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has given a detailed prompt asking for an analysis of risk factors related to rearrest recidivism for a specific individual. They\u2019ve provided all the necessary details about his background, including age, race, education level, marital status, job history, substance use, depression, and religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each risk factor one by one and assess whether it significantly affects his likelihood of rearresting. Starting with substance use: he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that seems low. However, since recidivism rates can vary based on other factors like age or environment, this might not be the highest risk.\n\nNext is depression over the past month: no significant symptoms reported. Without any mental health issues, it's less likely he'll feel depressed now either. This could lower his recidivism probability.\n\nAge and education level are also considered. He\u2019s 22, which might indicate a younger group with potentially higher recidivism rates due to youth unemployment. But since he hasn\u2019t been employed in the past year, maybe this isn't as severe as it would be for someone who has actively sought employment.\n\nMarital status: not living alone is actually positive because it reduces opportunities for reoffending through lack of support networks. This could lower his recidivism risk compared to someone living with his parents, but I'm not sure how much weight to give this factor here.\n\nJob history: he's never been employed, which could mean higher risks. But without context on job stability or industry, it's hard to quantify. The past year of no work experience might be an outlier.\n\nReligion: he\u2019s not religious and doesn\u2019t believe God plays a role in his decisions. This is interesting because some recidivism models don't factor in religious beliefs as strongly. It could mean he's less likely to repeat his bad luck, but I'm not certain how impactful that is for rearrest risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the user seems focused on assessing each factor individually and then combining them into a prediction with confidence. The response should be concise, using JSON format with specific keys and values. \n\nI also need to make sure my analysis accurately reflects each factor without overinterpreting any. For instance, substance use is low but not outright bad. Depression and religious beliefs could influence decisions, so they should be considered but not dominant factors in this case.\n\nFinally, the confidence level needs to represent how strongly I believe each risk factor contributes to recidivism. Since some factors like job history or religion are less clear-cut, my confidence might be moderate but higher than others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating a low level of substance use.
