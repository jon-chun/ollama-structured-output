    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. He's arrested twice and has been convicted, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. \n\nHe's young and living alone without a high school diploma or GED. That\u2019s a concern because lower education levels can affect job prospects and social integration. Living with his biological mother adds stress from family issues. But he's already single now, so maybe that's less of an issue.\n\nNot having used drugs in the past four years means no recent substance abuse. That's reassuring. He's not feeling depressed over the last month either, which is a positive point because depression can hinder recovery.\n\nHe has two jobs and hasn't mentioned using any during this period, but it might depend on his current role. However, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so getting job stability could be challenging. But since he's single now, maybe that\u2019s easier to manage.\n\nLooking at the risk factors: being young often makes people less reofficient due to age-related changes in behavior and motivation. The lack of education might hinder job opportunities if he can't find a stable job or starts looking for entry-level positions. Living alone is tough, especially without support systems. But since he's single now, maybe that\u2019s easier.\n\nOverall, while he has some positive aspects like being young and not having significant issues, the low educational background and living situation add layers of risk. I\u2019d say there's a moderate chance he might rearrest, so \"YES\" with a medium confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young\", \"low\", \"very young individuals often have lower recidivism rates due to less time for reoffending and older behavioral patterns.\"),\n    (\"low education\", \"medium\", \"lower educational attainment can hinder job opportunities, social integration, and career progression, especially in younger generations.\"),\n    (\"single living situation\", \"low\", \"being single reduces stress from family responsibilities and allows individuals more flexibility in managing personal affairs.\"),\n    (\"no substance use history\", \"medium\", \"a lack of recent drug use doesn't inherently increase recidivism rates, but can lead to substance abuse if reintroduced later.\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"high\", \"not feeling depressed may not directly impact recidivism without underlying stressors or mental health issues affecting behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
