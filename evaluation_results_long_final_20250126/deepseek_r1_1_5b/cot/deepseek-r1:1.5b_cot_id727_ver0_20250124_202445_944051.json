    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 19-year-old male who's lived with his biological mother in an urban area. He identifies as White but has no high school diploma, never used college credits, has drug problems for four years (marijuana), and hasn't felt depressed for a month. His parents talk to him regularly about the economy.\n\nFirst, looking at substance use: He's been using marijuana for four years and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That seems concerning because substance abuse can lead to various issues like addiction, mental health problems, etc.\n\nNext, living with his biological mother in a small household suggests possible stress or stressors from the home environment, which might affect both physical and mental health.\n\nHigh school education: He doesn't have it, but he's 19. That\u2019s a bit low for high school completion, especially in some contexts. Maybe that affects educational opportunities later on.\n\nSocial factors: He's living alone, which can be stressful and restrictive. Also, not talking to his parents about issues might indicate isolation or lack of support from family and peers.\n\nMental health history: Not feeling depressed for a month is positive but needs more context. If this was ongoing or related to substance use, it could be worse.\n\nGeographically: Urban area with a small household size; urban living can be stressful and affect mental health.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has substance abuse issues, which are serious. Living alone in an urban household adds stress. No formal education might delay learning skills later. Lack of communication with parents could lead to feeling isolated. His low high school status without support might make it harder to catch up. The lack of mental health improvement since not feeling depressed for a month suggests possible relapse or more serious issues.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems like there's a significant risk that he might rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is concerning and may lead to alcohol abuse if not managed properly.
