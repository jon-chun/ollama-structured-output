    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess a person's risk of rearrest within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old Black male who has been arrested 8 times with convictions. That's pretty serious. He's also living alone and hasn't had a partner, which might reduce support networks. He never married yet, so the possibility of reintegrating is low. His age, being young, makes him more vulnerable to reoffending because he's at a developmental stage.\n\nHis background with no formal education and not enrolled in college suggests a lack of academic skills. This could be a significant factor. His substance abuse history is five years ago with marijuana, which might indicate some relapse potential but is less severe compared to substances like cocaine or alcohol. He hasn't felt depressed for the past month, so his mental health status is stable.\n\nHe's raised by his biological mother in an urban household of three, which might mean he has limited support systems. As a young Black male, this could be another vulnerability factor. However, since he's living alone and hasn't married yet, the potential for romantic reintegration isn't too high.\n\nHis substance abuse history is five years old, so while it's not recent, it's more than some other factors like drug use in youth or substance abuse in the past decade. The lack of support systems means he can rely less on family and friends for help. His GED might give him a sense of hope but doesn't compensate for his criminal history.\n\nPutting all this together: high risk due to multiple arrests, substance abuse, living alone, limited support networks, no education, and living in an urban area with a biological mom. The risk isn't extremely high because he's older than many, but it's still concerning. Given that his recidivism is based on multiple factors, I would predict a moderate risk, likely \"YES\" as rearrest may occur.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"the person has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. this indicates a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"medium\", \"he has used marijuana in the past four years, but he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. his substance abuse history is five years old\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"he has never been married and is currently living alone. this limits family support and increases vulnerability to reintegration.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_support_system\", \"medium\", \"he raised his mother in an urban household of size 3, indicating limited support networks. he also doesn't have a biological partner\"),\n    (\"no_formal_education\", \"high\", \"he has never been enrolled in college and lacks a GED certificate. this weakens academic skills, which are often associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"biological_mother\", \"high\", \"living with his biological mother could provide some support systems for him to rely on. however, living alone further reduces this potential.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
