    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down each factor they provided and see how it stacks up.\n\nFirst, age is a concern because people get arrested more as they grow older due to life expectancy decreasing. He's 21, which is on the higher side but not extreme. His gender is male, which isn't particularly significant here. His ethnicity is White, but I don't have info on racial disparities in recidivism. Education level is high school diploma plus 2-year college, so he's a bit older than average. He's enrolled now, so maybe that could affect his behavior.\n\nNext, past convictions are none, so no immediate issues from prior arrest. Marital status isn't indicated as living alone, but I don't know how that affects recidivism rates. Number of previous jobs is four, which seems low but not impossible. He's never used drugs in the past four years and hasn't been depressed for the last month. These are all neutral to moderate factors.\n\nFamily background: he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That might mean he feels closer to family members, which could influence behavior. Since he's young, it's possible he's more susceptible due to younger brain development and less developed social skills.\n\nSocial support is something to consider\u2014no info on how strong that is. Now, looking at risk factors: age (moderate), gender (neutral), ethnicity (unknown), education (moderate), prior convictions (none), marital status ( living alone isn't indicated, but urban environment might help), employment (four jobs is low but not impossible), drug use (never used in the past four years), mood (not depressed last month), and family background.\n\nLooking at recidivism rates by age: 21-year-olds have a moderate to high risk. Gender, ethnicity, and marital status are neutral or slightly higher. Education level also contributes a medium factor since he's beyond average education. No prior convictions mean no immediate issue from past arrest. Social support is unknown, but urban environment might help with family bonds.\n\nPutting this together, age (moderate), education (medium), family support (unknown but urban helps), and living situation (low) all contribute to a moderate risk. Without more info on substance abuse or mood, it's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the moderate factors suggest a possibility of rearrest in three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"moderate\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"family support\", \"unknown but urban helps\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 143 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
