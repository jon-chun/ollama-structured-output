    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so the user is a criminal risk assessment expert. They provided a detailed profile of an individual with specific characteristics. My task is to assess each risk factor and determine the overall likelihood of recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the relevant risk factors. The person is 20, Hispanic, not convicted yet, living alone, has a high school diploma, never used drugs, not depressed, raised by their parents in an urban area with six kids. They haven't held many jobs and don't use drugs.\n\nI'll start with substance use. They've never used drugs in the past four years, so that's probably low risk. Next, substance use frequency\u2014no history either way, so medium but not high.\n\nNext is substance use behavior. No substance abuse history, so again medium. Drug dependence? Low since no history, and not depressed yet.\n\nFinancial status: They have a high school diploma, 5'1\", living alone, urban residence with six kids. These are typical low to moderate risk factors for substance abuse without severe financial problems.\n\nAge-related issues: Younger adults face higher risks of substance use, so it's medium here but likely not as high as others like substance use itself.\n\nFamily dynamics: Raising children in large households can sometimes lead to issues like substance dependence or stress, which are low to moderate risk factors.\n\nCriminal behavior: Not convicted yet means no criminal history. Medium risk since it could lead to recidivism if they commit again.\n\nIntelligence and education level: High school diploma isn't a strong indicator of intelligence; medium risk because higher education is associated with better cognitive skills but doesn't directly impact substance use risk here.\n\nLifestyle factors like living alone can sometimes increase stress and substance dependence, so low moderate risk.\n\nLegal status: Not enrolled in college means not in a position to commit crimes immediately. Medium risk since criminal behavior could follow without immediate action.\n\nMental health: Low depression since the past month doesn't indicate significant mental health issues. So medium risk for mental health-related behaviors but not high.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor is at medium risk except for substance use history and dependence, which are also low. The overall recidivism probability seems moderate to high. Considering that this person hasn't committed anything yet and has a stable upbringing, the likelihood of them recidivizing is probably on the lower end of medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"substance_use_behavior\", \"low\"),\n    (\"drugs_dependent\", \"low\"),\n    (\"family dynamics\", \"low\"),\n    (\"intelligence\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"lifestyle\", \"low\"),\n    (\"criminal_activity\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"college enrollment\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"not_consulted\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
