    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's married, living with his spouse, has high school diploma, not in college, held two jobs, no drug use or depression history, and lived with parents in an urban area since he was young.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: 21. Not particularly severe, but a minor might face higher risks in the long term.\n2. **Gender (White)**: White is typically more likely to be less risky than other groups, especially if they have lower education or criminal history.\n3. **Marital Status (married)**: Generally associated with lower risk factors compared to single individuals.\n4. **Living Situation (6 household members)**: Urban living might mean easier access to resources and opportunities, but it could also depend on where he comes from.\n5. **Education**: High school diploma. Lower than college degree, which can increase recidivism rates.\n6. **Employment**: 2 jobs during the year. This shows some work history, possibly indicating better job prospects.\n7. **Non-Drugs/Depression**: No drug use or depression in past four years or recent month. Better profile for recidivism.\n8. **Home Background (Urban living)**: Possibly easier to find housing and resources compared to rural areas.\n\nNow, considering these factors together: he's young, married, urban, with some work history but not criminal record, no substance abuse. That suggests a lower risk than the high end of medium. But since he has one arrest without conviction, that might place him on the higher side, especially if it affects his recidivism rate in the next three years.\n\nPutting them together: minor age, low education level, urban living, stable employment, and no substance issues. This suggests a relatively lower risk than someone with a more criminal history or lower education. So overall risk is probably not very high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"a minor age may have varying risk depending on the context, but in this case, it's considered less severe\"),\n    (\"gender (white)\", \"low\", \"being white might correlate with lower recidivism rates compared to other groups based on available data\"),\n    (\"marital status (married)\", \"low\", \"married status often indicates a more stable life compared to single individuals, which can relate to lesser recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"living situation (6 household members)\", \"low\", \"an urban living environment may offer more opportunities and resources than rural areas, contributing to lower risk factors in the context of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education (high school diploma)\", \"low\", \"a high school diploma is less common than a college degree, which can increase recidivism rates for individuals with such education levels\"),\n    (\"employment (2 jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"having worked in two different roles may indicate some job stability and potential better prospects compared to single-year employment\"),\n    (\"non-drug use or depression history\", \"low\", \"no substance abuse or recent depressed experiences can indicate a more positive profile for recidivism),\n    (\"home background (urban living)\", \"low\", \"an urban living environment can influence factors like access to resources and opportunities, which may contribute to lower risk in this context\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
