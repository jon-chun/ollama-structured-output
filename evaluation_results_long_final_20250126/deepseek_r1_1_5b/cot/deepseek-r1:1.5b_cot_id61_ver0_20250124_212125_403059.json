They're 22-year-old Asian male with some background details. The task is to assess risk factors for 3-year rearrest recidivism using an expert model.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each of the eight factors mentioned and assign them appropriately. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: He's 22, so not too young or old. That doesn't significantly increase risk.\n2. **Race/Ethnicity**: Asian Pacific Islander is a positive sign because many Asian individuals tend to be more recidivist compared to White.\n3. **Marital Status**: Single and living alone reduce the risk since they're less likely to seek reoffending aid.\n4. **Children or Families**: No children, so no potential for reoffending from others.\n5. **Education Level**: High school diploma but in college suggests some educational background might help.\n6. **Job History**: No jobs since the person isn't working and has a high school diploma indicates they're likely to stay out of work unless in education.\n7. **Drug Use**: Recent use of marijuana is concerning because drug use can be a strong motivator for reoffending.\n8. **Depression**: Overcoming depression over the past month might reduce recidivism, but it's not mentioned as a factor here.\n\nNow, considering each factor:\n\n- Age and race are positive.\n- Single status lowers risk.\n- No kids means less chance of family issues.\n- High school diploma in college suggests some potential to rejoin society.\n- Recent drug use is concerning, so medium weight?\n- No depression info, so low for this factor.\n\nNext, I'll assign weights. The most significant factors are age, race, and marital status. Age is low risk, but if he's not employed or lacks education, it might be higher. Marital status and race both contribute positively. Recent drug use adds to the medium weight. Depression, though, isn't mentioned, so I'll keep it low.\n\nNow, adding up: age (low), race (high), marital status (low), no children (low). So total risk is high because of positive factors like race and marital status. But recent drug use complicates it a bit more.\n\nConsidering the expert model, most factors are positive except for some concerns. The overall risk would be medium, but with some added positives and one negative factor, maybe high.\n\nFinally, considering he's young and single living alone, which is a significant protective factor. But recent drug use might make him at higher risk. I'll predict a moderate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Not significantly impacting recidivism as age does not directly affect risk levels in this context.\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander race is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to White populations of the same age and socioeconomic standing.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Single and living alone reduce the likelihood of reoffending due to reduced opportunities for legal aid and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Children or Families\", \"low\", \"No children means fewer family members who could contribute to recidivism risk indirectly through social support or support networks.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma with further education indicates potential for higher reoffending behavior, as individuals in this group often have more opportunities for access to legal assistance and community support.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"No employment history means individuals are less likely to seek out legal aid or resources to address recidivism issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent use of marijuana indicates a potential motivational factor, though other forms of drug use may also contribute to recidivism risk.

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year.
