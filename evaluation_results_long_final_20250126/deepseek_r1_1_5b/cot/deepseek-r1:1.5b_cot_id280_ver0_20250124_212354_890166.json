Let me start by breaking down each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested six times but hasn't convicted. He's 5'7\" and weighs 170 lbs. Not high school-educated, not in college, lived alone. He doesn't have any substance abuse history or feelings of depression over the past month. Also, he considers God involved with his past.\n\nNow, I should look at each risk factor. For Black men aged 21, the recidivism rate is generally higher than for others. But since they've never convicted, that might change things. The age group is young, which often leads to better opportunities and lower risks in some areas.\n\nNot having a high school diploma suggests there might be underlying issues like lack of education or limited opportunities. The fact he's single means he didn't have to support himself, but recidivism can vary by socioeconomic status too. Not using drugs since four years implies minimal substance abuse, which is better than not doing anything.\n\nHis living situation in an urban area with his parents and a household size of 4 might affect his environment\u2014maybe more opportunities or different social dynamics. The lack of support from family could be a barrier if he's struggling financially or dealing with stress.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month is important because depression can hinder recovery, especially for someone who's already facing financial challenges. God being involved might not add much unless it provides an external motivation.\n\nPutting this all together, his age, lack of education, and living situation suggest a higher risk. The arrest history but no convictions indicate some progress, but with so many factors at play, the risk isn't low. His lack of substance use and support from family are positive steps.\n\nSo my prediction is that he will have a recidivism rate above average, probably around 35-40%. With an estimated confidence level around 75% because there are several significant factors contributing to his risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21-year-old Black male is young and might have better opportunities\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"no high school diploma could indicate limited opportunities\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"medium\", \"single and urban living may affect environment\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use history, better than non-use\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"single and family of 4 might impact support\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"not feeling depressed over past month indicates positive factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
