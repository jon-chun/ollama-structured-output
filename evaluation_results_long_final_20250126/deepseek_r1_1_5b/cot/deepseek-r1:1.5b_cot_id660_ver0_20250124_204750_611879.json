    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for someone who's been arrested six times with a history of substance abuse. They're 18 years old, Hispanic, living alone without a high school diploma or GED. They've usedcocaine and haven't felt depressed in the past month. Their upbringing was with his biological mother in a rural area with four kids.\n\nFirst, their age being under 21 makes them a high risk because they're more likely to be substance abuse dependent due to little supervision. The Hispanic background doesn't directly impact recidivism by itself but is a factor that can interact with other variables.\n\nThey've been arrested six times and convicted, which suggests a history of criminal behavior and determination to change it. Substance abuse is a long-term issue that often leads to reoffending because they may not have learned the proper methods for dealing with alcohol or drugs.\n\nTheir living situation alone isn't high risk, but combined with substance use, it can lead to problems affecting their ability to reintegrate into society. The absence of higher education and their upbringing in a rural area without support systems might make them more vulnerable when they do reoffend.\n\nThey've usedcocaine for the past four years, which is a serious substance abuse problem that can cause severe emotional and mental health issues down the line. Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests they're handling it with some strength but may not have the resources to cope properly.\n\nThere's no significant criminal history in terms of crimes or convictions, so recidivism isn't driven by past criminal behavior. The combination of substance abuse and the young age makes them a high-risk individual despite their other factors.\n\nGiven all this, I'll assess each factor. Age (high), substance use (moderate?), living alone (low), no higher education (low), upbringing in rural area (low). Recidivism would be very high because of substance use leading to reoffending and dependency.\n</think>\n\nThe individual's risk factors are significant due to their age, substance abuse history, and living situation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Age**: 18 years old is a high-risk factor for criminal behavior, especially given little supervision.\n\n2. **Substance Abuse History**: Long-term dependency on alcohol or drugs (cocaine) increases recidivism risk.\n\n3. **Living Situation**: Living alone and lack of higher education contribute to vulnerability when reoffending occurs.\n\n4. **Upbringing in Rural Area**: Limited support systems can exacerbate problems faced during reoffending.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is YES. The high-risk elements (age, substance abuse) make rearrest unlikely despite other mitigating factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"A young person is more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to little supervision and potential drug use issues in their early years.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"moderate\", \" substance abuse history increases the likelihood of reoffending because it often leads to dependency and emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \" living alone can increase vulnerability when reintegrating into society, especially if they face new challenges or consequences.\"),\n    (\"no_higher_education\", \"low\", \" lack of higher education makes it harder for them to acquire the knowledge or skills needed to change their behavior and address substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \" living in a rural area without support systems can make individuals more vulnerable when they encounter new problems, particularly related to substance abuse and emotional impact.\" )\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
