    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. She's been arrested once but hasn't convicted. That's interesting because usually recidivism happens after conviction, so even one arrest might be significant. Her age is young, which makes her vulnerable to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That's a standard adult weight for someone her age, but it doesn't immediately indicate risk factors related to height or weight that would cause issues in the long run.\n\nNow, she's never married and lives alone. Having no job means she's not working, which could lead to certain behaviors like substance use, which is one of her habits. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, mostly during the last month when she felt down. That seems concerning because substance abuse can complicate things.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could mean she's at risk of higher education issues later on, which might affect her ability to reintegrate into society fully. Being single also adds to the strain, especially if they're living alone.\n\nHer household size is 5, and they live in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but it's not a given that this specific setup would lead to rearrest. Her faith isn't mentioned, which might influence her behavior, but it's unclear how significant that factor is here.\n\nPutting it all together: she has one arrest without conviction, has substance abuse issues, no formal education, lives alone, and has a young age. These factors together suggest a higher risk of rearrest. The lack of criminal history, coupled with potential negative habits like substance use, makes her more susceptible to recidivism.\n\nConsidering the factors, especially the substance abuse and possibly the lack of formal education leading to challenges in reintegrating into society, it's reasonable to predict that she has a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"She has been using substances for the past month when feeling down, which could complicate her behavior and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"age-related_risk\", \"high\", \"She is young, making her vulnerable to criminal behavior compared to adults.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
