    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this guy. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from Black descent. That might make him more likely to reciditate because of genetic factors, but I'm not sure how significant that is in his case.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marrying someone could increase risk, but living alone might lower it if he has less social support or stress from being single. Plus, he has a high school diploma and a 2-year college enrollment. Lower education level might mean more trouble starting fresh, but I'm not sure how that plays in here.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and weighs 165 lbs. That seems average for his age. Physical fitness might help him work through issues, but again, I'm not certain if it significantly affects recidivism risk at this point.\n\nHe hasn't been arrested yet but has been caught once. His offense is mild since he's a minor, so maybe that makes him less likely to repeat, but I don't know if being a minor adds much to his risk from the legal side.\n\nHe's never used drugs in the past four years and didn't use them during the last month. That seems like good news because drug use often correlates with lower recidivism rates. But I'm not sure how common it is for someone of his age, especially a minor, to have used drugs consistently over such a long period.\n\nHe's raised by parents who lived together in a family household of four in an urban area. That might mean he has more support from them but could also lead to issues like substance abuse if they're not as careful. But again, I'm not certain how this factors into his recidivism risk.\n\nHis background isn't too great either; he's not a typical Black man in terms of criminal history. So maybe that's a plus or just another factor without much weight on the overall prediction.\n\nPutting it all together, these are factors that might influence recidivism, but they don't seem to add up to a very high risk. He's young, has some education, is single and urban, doesn't use drugs much, and raised by supportive parents who lived in an area with four people. So I'm leaning towards a low risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n{\"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"unrelated to family background\", \"low\", \"A person of his age, raised by supportive parents living in an urban household of size 4, may have more support from the community but could also lead to issues like substance abuse if not handled carefully.\"),\n    (\"low risk for recidivism as a minor with minimal criminal history and no significant past crimes or substance abuse\", \"very low risk due to his age, education level, living situation, and lack of criminal history, even though he hasn't been arrested yet.\")\n  ], \"prediction\": \"NO\", \"confidence\": 30}",
