    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 22-year-old female will rearrest in the next three years. She's young, single, and lived in a household of size three when she was arrested. Her background includes holding a job during the year and not using drugs for four years. She feels down and doesn't seem like she uses much substance. \n\nFirst, I need to identify potential risk factors. Since she's only been arrested once, that might be less of a concern compared to someone who's been in jail longer or more times. But being single and living with two others could make her less likely to reenter society, especially if they have resources.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs for four years, so maybe substance abuse isn't the big issue here. Her job history is limited because she only worked during the past year, which might not be enough to contribute much to criminal behavior. She's an adult without a high school diploma, but being 22 means she has some potential if there are underlying issues.\n\nAge and education level aren't huge factors on their own, especially since she's only been in jail once. The household size of three might make her less likely to reenter the community because more family members could have different life circumstances affecting recidivism rates.\n\nShe's a 22-year-old, which is relatively young for criminal behavior. This could mean she hasn't had enough time to develop harmful habits or societal pressures that lead to rearrests. Her feelings of being down don't necessarily translate into criminal behavior; they might just be emotional or lackluster in that aspect.\n\nLooking at substance abuse: four years without using drugs means she's consistently safe from addiction. But sometimes, even if someone hasn't engaged in drug use, they can be a risk factor for other issues like mental health problems, which might affect criminal behavior.\n\nThe household size of three could mean her family has different statuses: some may have been through similar situations as her. Maybe one is living with her, and others are part of her extended family. This diversity in circumstances could contribute to lower recidivism rates for this age group.\n\nShe's single and living alone when she was arrested but not now, which might indicate a lack of social support. Social isolation can make someone less likely to return home and engage in criminal activities.\n\nHer limited job history means she hasn't had much exposure to the environment that could lead to recidivism. Without significant experience or access to positive environments, it's harder for her to commit.\n\nShe has no substance abuse record, so while other factors might contribute, this is a key piece of information. If she wasn't using drugs at all in the past four years, it might be more about whether there are underlying issues related to depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that affect behavior.\n\nThe age being low could mean less chance for recidivism compared to someone who's been in society longer. She hasn't had time to engage with criminal activities and societal pressures, which can weaken the link between past behavior and future risk.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014substance abuse record, household size, education level, age, job history\u2014all of which present challenges but not impossibility\u2014she might have a lower recidivism rate. However, since she's only ever been arrested once, it's not impossible for her to rearrest in the next three years.\n\nI think there's a moderate risk because while she's at this young age and single, social isolation could mitigate some risks. But without other significant issues like substance abuse or mental health problems that haven't been fully explored, her recidivism is on the lower side.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_abuse_record\", \"medium\", \"She has never used drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"She's a young adult, single, and living with two others.
