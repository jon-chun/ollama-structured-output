    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this person. He's a 21-year-old, which is pretty young. He's a male from White, but maybe his race isn't that important here. He's been arrested once without conviction, and he hasn't been convicted yet. That's interesting because it shows he's still vulnerable.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. His height is on the shorter side for a 21-year-old, but maybe that's not too bad since he's single. He's not living alone, which might mean there are family members around him to support him after release. His family size is four, so I guess it's small, meaning he'll have some close people.\n\nHe completed an associate or junior college degree and isn't currently enrolled in college. That probably means he didn't go through the standard two-year graduation process, which could be a risk because you might need to complete that before being released. But since he hasn't been enrolled yet, maybe he's not at risk right now.\n\nHe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to delinquency or poor behavior in a community. He's raised two kids during the year, which might mean he feels isolated or unsupported after his release.\n\nHis biological parents lived together with him in a household of size four, so that's pretty small. That could be a risk because if they're involved in the case, he might feel pressured to help, but I'm not sure how severe that would be compared to other risks.\n\nHe doesn't identify as an accused or suspect, which is good because it means no potential for recidivism based on that identification. His age being young can sometimes complicate things, especially if he has a history of substance abuse or substance use disorders, but his recent drug use and lack of depression seem more serious.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors are: young age (young people often have higher recidivism rates), arrest without conviction (high risk because you're still vulnerable), not being an accused or suspect (no potential for recidivism here), single status (maybe lower risk since no family pressure?), small family size (less support from family), high drug use (dangerous behavior) and lack of depression (another risk). The substance abuse is a big one that could lead to delinquency, which increases the risk.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think this person has a very high risk of rearrest. He's vulnerable because he hasn't been convicted yet, is young, not in a secure family situation, and used substances. His recent drug use adds another layer of risk. Therefore, the prediction should be yes, with a high confidence level because all these factors together indicate he's at a higher risk.\n</think>\n\nThe person faces significant risks due to his vulnerable age, arrest history without conviction, lack of support from a secure family structure, and substance abuse. These factors collectively increase his recidivism risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young age\", \"high\", \"His young age suggests higher risk of delinquency and recidivism compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"arrest without conviction\", \"high\", \"This indicates he remains vulnerable despite not being convicted, highlighting potential recidivism risks.\",\n    \"single status\", \"low\", \"Single status typically reduces family pressure but does not entirely eliminate it.\",\n    \"small family size\", \"low\", \"A small family can provide some support during release.\",\n    \"drugs used in past four years\", \"high\", \" substance abuse is a significant risk factor for delinquency and recidivism.\",\n    \"lack of depression over the past month\", \"medium\", \"His lack of current depression status suggests potential vulnerabilities.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
