    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this person reciditing within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once and convicted. He's 5'6\" and weighs 160 lbs, living alone with no employment. No history of substance abuse or depression in the past month. Growing up raised by his biological mom in a size 4 household in an urban area.\n\nStarting with family dynamics: Growing up in a family raises questions about identity and belonging. That might lead to issues later on. But he's from a small community, so maybe that helps him feel connected? Maybe not too bad but could create some separation issues if things go south.\n\nThen there's drug use history. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That seems problematic because using substances can lead to addiction or worse behavior. I think his substance abuse is a significant risk factor here.\n\nNext, living alone without employment. Living alone is stressful but maybe manageable at first. However, no stable job could make him vulnerable if he can't find work. But since he's 18, it's still possible he might start looking for work or find some temporary gigs. So that's a risk but probably not terminal.\n\nReligio issues: He considered God in his upbringing. Maybe that influences his behavior, but it could also be superficial unless there are deeper religious beliefs that affect later life. Still a bit of a risk factor, though.\n\nNow, looking at other factors like substance abuse and depression\u2014these are already covered under the drug history and mental health. \n\nPutting this all together: He's from a small community, which might help but could lead to separation issues. Drug use is high, which is concerning. Living alone without job gives some stress but maybe manageable. His background in raising by his mom ties him to a specific culture or group, though it doesn't directly impact recidivism. \n\nConsidering all these factors, especially his substance abuse history and living situation, I'm leaning towards this person having a moderate risk of reciditing within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\", \"he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is concerning\"),\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"medium\", \"his growing up in a family raises questions about identity and belonging, potentially leading to issues later on but with a small community helping him feel connected initially\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone without employment gives some stress but possibly manageable at first\"),\n    (\"religion_issues\", \"medium\", \"considering god in upbringing could influence behavior but may be superficial unless deeper beliefs affect later life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
