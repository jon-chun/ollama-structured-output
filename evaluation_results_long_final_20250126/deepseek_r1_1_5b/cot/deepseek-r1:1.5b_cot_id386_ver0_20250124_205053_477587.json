They're 22, white, with specific age-related issues\u2014lived with his biological mother in a rural area without a high school diploma, and has a substance use history.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor. The person is young and might face substance abuse risks because they've engaged in it before. They've lived with their parents for four years, which could affect their mental health if he feels neglected or lacks support. His rural background might contribute to isolation from societal support systems.\n\nThe absence of a high school diploma limits his education options, potentially affecting higher education and career opportunities. He's used marijuana, so substance use risk is present. The lack of a GED makes him more vulnerable to fraud or scams.\n\nPutting this together, the risks seem significant but not overwhelmingly severe. However, given the substance abuse history and living situation, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\", \"the person has used marijuana in the past four years\"),\n    (\"ageRelatedIssues\", \"medium\", \"young adult who has lived with his biological mother for four years and considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally\"),\n    (\"lived_in_a_rural_area_and_not_enrolled_in_college\", \"medium\", \"in a rural area, possibly contributing to isolation from societal support systems and limited access to higher education and career opportunities\"),\n    (\"hasnever-been-married-and-is-not-living-alone\", \"medium\", \"not married and not living alone could affect their mental health if they feel neglected or unsupported\"),\n    (\"hasnever-been-high-school-diploma_or_gedcertified\", \"medium\", \"lack of education limits higher education and career opportunities, potentially affecting future success\"),\n    (\"hasnever-been-deprived_over_thePast_month\", \"low\", \"deprived in the past month could increase stress or anxiety that may affect decision-making during rearrest\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
