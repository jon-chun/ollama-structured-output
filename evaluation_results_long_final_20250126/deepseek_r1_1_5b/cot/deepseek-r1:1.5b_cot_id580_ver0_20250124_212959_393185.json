    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user assess risk factors for a 22-year-old male who's been arrested once. He's an adult with no prior substance abuse or depression, living in an urban area with his biological mother as a household of five. His education is high school and in college, which might indicate some potential academic issues.\n\nFirst, I should consider each risk factor one by one. Age isn't too bad; he's 22, so maybe not a major risk, but it's important to think about factors like substance use or other behavioral issues as he grows older.\n\nNext, being an adult is better than a minor, so that's positive. No prior substance abuse means fewer problems with substance use. But since he's been arrested once, that might raise some concerns. Maybe he could have had some underlying substance use before entering the system.\n\nHis depression hasn't affected him in the past month, which suggests he's managing well emotionally. That's a plus. The fact that he's raised his mother in a household of five might indicate he was home-schooled, which is good for his development but could also affect his academic performance if not well handled.\n\nHe holds one job and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed in the past month, so that's encouraging. Urban living with his biological mother could mean he has access to education resources and mental health support. But since he's a minor, some local issues might exist too.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are no major substance abuse concerns yet, the arrest history is concerning. The lack of substance use before being arrested means that if someone uses drugs in college, they might reintroduce them later. His depression hasn't affected him much, but since he's a minor, some stress from living with his biological mother could have implications.\n\nSo the risk factors are: no prior substance use (which is good but not conclusive), lack of substance use before arrest, potential re-offending after drug use, and possibly local issues affecting minors. The prediction isn't straightforward yet because while there's a risk, the arrest history may suggest some potential for recidivism.\n\nI should mention that without more substance use history, it's hard to say definitively but note that this individual has a vulnerable spot as an adult. So the overall risk isn't very high, but it could be on the higher side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"no prior substance abuse\", \"medium\", \"This indicates minimal risk of recidivism due to substance use before arrest\"),\n    (\"lack of substance use before arrest\", \"medium\", \"If substance use was previously reintroduced, this could affect future behavior\"),\n    (\"potential re-offending after drug use\", \"medium\", \"Minor factors like alcohol or smoking can lead to re-offending in adults),\n    (\"minor living situation and potential stress\", \"low\", \"Local issues affecting minors may have an impact on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
