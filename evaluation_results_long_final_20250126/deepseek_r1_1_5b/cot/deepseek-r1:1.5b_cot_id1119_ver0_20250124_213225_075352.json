    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this person reciditing after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old Black male with no college education. That seems like a high risk because being black might mean lower access to education and job opportunities. He hasn't been convicted of any crimes yet, so the legal aspects aren't resolved. But recidivism isn't about getting caught again; it's about returning or not.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't seem like a huge weight for his height, but maybe that can be a sign of muscle mass? Also, he's living alone, which could mean less support from family if he needs help. He hasn't used a job, so no income to rely on. But again, recidivism is about reintegration into society.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. That probably reduces the chances of supporting his partner or family. His household size was 4 before, which is low compared to the current situation where he's living alone with someone else. Also, he hasn't had kids yet, so no chance for new families to help him.\n\nHe's a drug user. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially during times of emotional pain. That could be a significant risk because substance abuse is often linked to recidivism. Even though it's been going on for months, he might still be reliving the trauma that drove him into addiction.\n\nHe's lived with someone for four years before and now lives alone. That might mean he's less dependent on support from others, increasing his risk of being exploited or relying too much on external help. His living situation could also affect his ability to seek help if needed.\n\nHis family isn't mentioned, which makes it harder to assess the immediate impact. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, the primary risk is about reintegration and not getting caught again. However, the ongoing negative experiences with substance abuse could still influence recidivism rates.\n\nSo putting this all together: higher education and lower access make him a high risk. Living alone and single adds to the burden. No previous convictions but he's reliving trauma. Substance use in the past four years seems like a strong indicator. Living alone increases his dependency on others, which could be another factor. The lack of family support is also concerning. Overall, this person has significant risks that could lead to recidivism.\n</think>\n\nThe individual presents several significant risk factors for recidivism:\n\n1. **Low Education and Gender**: High school education reduces access to education and job opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\n\n2. **Lack of Previous Convictions**: No convictions yet impact recidivism but he has relived trauma with substance abuse.\n\n3. **Living Alone and Single**: Increased dependency on support systems, potentially reducing reintegration chances.\n\n4. **Substance Abuse**: Long-term use increases risk, as substance abuse is often associated with recidivism.\n\n5. **Lack of Family Support**: Without family presence, it may impact immediate support and potential for reintegration.\n\nOverall, these factors suggest a high risk of recidivism within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"22-year-old male with no college education increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_status\", \"single\", \"Living alone and single may reduce support for reintegration\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"yes\", \"Long-term substance use, particularly during negative emotional times, increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"lifestyle_factor\", \"low\", \"Lack of previous convictions reduces immediate risk but not long-term),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Current living alone status impacts support and reintegration chances\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
