    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 18-year-old female who's been arrested but not convicted will rearrest in the next three years. She's an 18-year-old female of color, hasn't had any prior convictions, is pretty young and didn't live with her biological parents in a big household. She used marijuana in the past four years and doesn't feel depressed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors that might contribute to recidivism here. Since she's 18, she's less than two years from starting her life sentence, which usually means recidivism is more likely. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe she has some low risk factors.\n\nShe's white, but I don't think race affects recidivism as much because it's often not a significant factor when other variables are considered. She never married and isn't living alone, which could be an issue if there's housing instability or unreliable support systems. She doesn't have a high school diploma, so maybe she didn't attend school, but that might also affect her ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nShe used marijuana four years ago, which is something I've read can sometimes lead to recidivism because it affects mood and behavior. But again, this person hasn't been convicted yet, so there's no immediate guilt or intent for reoffending.\n\nShe doesn't feel depressed over the past month, but depression does have some negative effects on mood and behavior, which could potentially contribute to recidivism. However, since she hasn't felt depressed in that time, maybe this isn't a strong factor here.\n\nThe household was five people before her biological parents moved out, so there might be issues if someone leaves the house without support or being left alone. That's something to look into.\n\nShe has one job during the year and doesn't attend college, which could mean she relies on employment for security but hasn't been successful yet. This might affect stability, but since she hasn't been convicted, maybe that's not directly a risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together, her age being under two years away from reintegration means there are some positive factors here. She has low prior convictions and no previous drug use (other than marijuana), which is a plus. However, she might face challenges with housing, support systems, depression, and possibly issues related to living alone.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact risk factors that increase recidivism. I think it's possible she could rearrest, especially given her lack of prior conviction and some negative life events like living without support or dealing with depression. But given her age and minimal criminal history, maybe there's a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_crivent\", \"low\", \"most individuals under two years old have no prior recidivism tendency as their sentence has not completed\"),\n    (\"low_mood_level\", \"medium\", \"she used marijuana which can influence mood and behavior, but since she hasn't been convicted, this may not directly contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"unreliable_support_system\", \"medium\", \"lacks support from her biological parents in a big household, affecting stability and reintegration\"),\n    (\"depressed_state\", \"low\", \"she doesn't feel depressed over the past month, which can mitigate some reoffending risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
