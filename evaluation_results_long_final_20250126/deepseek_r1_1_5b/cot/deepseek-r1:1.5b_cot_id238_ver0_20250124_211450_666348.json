Let me start by breaking down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male from Black ethnicity who has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means he might have some underlying issues or past behavior that could be reformed. He's young and single, which is a plus because being alone can provide more space for recidivism efforts.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch tall, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, isn't in college, hasn't had much job experience during the year, and has used drugs in the past four years. Specifically, he used marijuana in the past four years but only felt down in the dumps last month. That seems like a significant problem area because using substances can lead to negative behaviors that might not be easily reversible.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which is an advantage because it means there are fewer people around him to cause additional stress or add pressure. His family size was eight when he was 19, which suggests that he might have had to share resources with others in the household before being arrested. This could mean he faced some form of dependency or challenge.\n\nHe considers God to be something to him personally, which is a bit unusual but doesn't necessarily indicate recidivism risk. He's lived in a household of size 8 and has a single life as an adult, so maybe he's been dealing with family issues that could make him more prone to substance use or behavioral problems.\n\nPutting this all together, he's arrested three times without conviction, which is a significant concern because it means he didn't receive proper treatment. He's using substances frequently in the past four years, and specifically felt down recently. His single status and limited job history suggest he might have had some form of dependency or stress that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHowever, his single status and living alone provide a safety net which can help mitigate risks related to substance use and family issues. The fact that he's from a Black background might not directly influence recidivism risk in this case unless there are systemic issues tied to race, but the information given doesn't suggest any such factors.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I think the risk of recidivism is high because of his substance abuse history and the recent down period. The low education level could be a barrier if he's from an underfunded area, but given that he's single and has limited job history, maybe it's mitigated.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance use history\", \"medium\", \"He has been arrested three times without conviction.
