    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this person. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 18 years old and hasn't had any recidivism before her arrest seven times. That seems pretty high because typically, people in their early teens have lower recidivism rates compared to adults.\n\nShe identifies as Black, which might be a positive sign related to social acceptance and cultural influences on criminal behavior. But I'm not sure how much that affects the risk.\n\nHer age is 18; I think recidivism rates start dropping after around age 20 or so, especially for males. So maybe this person has an advantage there.\n\nShe's never married, which might affect her access to romantic or family support, but does that make her more prone to reoffending? Not necessarily. It could depend on the situation.\n\nShe's single and living alone, which is good because being isolated can reduce some risks. But still, it doesn't eliminate them entirely, especially if they've been in a vulnerable situation.\n\nHer education level isn't a high school diploma or GED, so she might not have access to formal learning skills necessary for reoffending. That could lower the risk somewhat but might not make it zero.\n\nShe's never lived with both biological parents, which is unusual. Raising children from single parents can be stressful and challenging financially and emotionally. That's a potential factor that could increase the risk because she might face unique challenges in supporting herself.\n\nShe's used drugs before\u2014cocaine four years ago and more recently when feeling down. This history of substance use should definitely raise her recidivism risk. Substance abuse is a significant factor because it can lead to relapse without support, especially under stress or mental health issues like depression.\n\nHer family was rural in size five, which could mean they might have less resources or support systems. That could add some strain on her and potentially increase the risk of reoffending if she faces challenges from living in a small area with limited access to resources.\n\nShe doesn't hold a job during the year, so there's no immediate income to rely on. This reduces the financial burden but doesn't necessarily lower recidivism rates because other factors like substance use and life events can still play a role.\n\nHer personal circumstances\u2014being Black might influence social support or opportunities in the community, but without more context, it's hard to quantify how significant that is. Living alone could also affect her ability to network with others for support or advice.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some factors like substance use and living alone that increase risk, the recidivism rate hasn't been particularly high in the past seven arrests. However, given her personal circumstances and substance use history, it's likely that she has a higher chance of reoffending within three years compared to someone without such experiences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Substance Use History\", \"high\", \"Her history ofcocaine use four years ago and more recently when feeling down in the dumps raised her recidivism risk.
