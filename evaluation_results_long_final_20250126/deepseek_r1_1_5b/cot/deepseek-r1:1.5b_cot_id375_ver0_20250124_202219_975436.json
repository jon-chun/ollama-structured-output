    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old, which is quite young. This can make him more likely to reoffend because there are fewer opportunities for recidivism compared to older adults. He's a male who identifies as White, which might influence his socioeconomic status and education level. He has been arrested three times and convicted, which shows he's committed to serving the community. His age and convictions suggest that he may have had prior positive outcomes.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches, which is about average for a young male, and he weighs 135 lbs\u2014also within a healthy range without concerning him too much. He's never been married or living alone, which might indicate he has more social support at home, potentially contributing to lower recidivism rates. His education level is neither high school diploma nor GED, so if he didn't attend college, that could be an issue because many adults with such backgrounds have higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's not employed and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might mean he's more reliant on his parents. However, without employment, his socioeconomic status is tied to the household income of two people, which could lead to some form of crime or substance abuse. He has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive signs about his mental health, which is crucial for recidivism risk assessment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area where there might be higher rates of crime or substance abuse because many urban areas have more criminal activity compared to rural areas. This could be a contributing factor if the family's environment has higher risks associated with it.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life, which is interesting. It suggests he may have some spiritual or religious beliefs affecting his behavior and decision-making, potentially influencing recidivism risk despite not directly stating it in the provided information.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: age (young), prior convictions, family living conditions, education level, substance abuse history, mental health, and religious influence. Each of these can contribute to higher recidivism rates. However, he's been arrested three times, which is a significant number for someone his age without any evident intent or opportunities for recidivism.\n\nHis education level is lower than average for his age, but since he's not a high school graduate or GED, it might raise concerns about his ability to reintegrate into society. He also has substance abuse history in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently, which could be a positive indicator of mental health stability.\n\nThe family living environment is urban with higher crime rates, which adds to potential risks. However, he's lived with his biological mother, so his family might have some control over his behavior through social support. His religious influence suggests he may engage in behaviors that are linked to religion, such as alcohol (marijuana) and potentially being more susceptible to criminal behavior based on religious beliefs.\n\nGiven all these factors\u2014positive aspects like positive mental health and family support, plus negative aspects like past convictions, substance abuse, urban living with higher crime rates, lower education level, and no employment\u2014the overall risk seems moderate. However, it's still a significant concern that recidivism might occur in the next three years.\n\nSo, putting this together, I would assign a medium risk factor weight to each of these factors and predict a YES for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young age\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"three prior convictions\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"low family living conditions\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"lower education level\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"substance abuse history\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"positive mental health indicators\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"relief from urban living environment through family support\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
