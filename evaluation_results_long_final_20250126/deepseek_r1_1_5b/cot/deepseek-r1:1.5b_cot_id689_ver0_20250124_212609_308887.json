    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this person. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at his age: he's 20 years old. I remember that younger people are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience or resources. But not all young people do that; sometimes they're motivated to work hard and contribute to society.\n\nNext, he's a male, specifically White. I think race can influence recidivism too. Maybe there are studies showing racial disparities in how often certain groups reoffend. But again, it's not just about the group but the individual circumstances within that group.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like an indicator of some sort of mistake or a problem he had with his previous life. If he made a mistake, maybe he's more likely to commit a repeat offense because there's no excuse for it. But if he was just caught with his head up all the time, that might make him less likely.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and 130 lbs. Weight can be a factor, but not sure how significant it is compared to height. It's probably more about overall physical condition than weight itself.\n\nHis height and weight are both normal for his age. He doesn't have any health issues mentioned either, which might make him less likely to have problems later on.\n\nHe's never been married or living alone. This seems like a positive sign because single people are often considered safer in some ways compared to couples. Living alone can also give them more control and independence, which is good for recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and not enrolled in college. That might indicate he didn't go to college full time or was not pursuing it. It could mean he had less experience working, which sometimes leads to higher rates of recidivism.\n\nHe's 2 jobs during the year. So, part-time work seems common for young people, especially if they're employed while studying. This balance between work and family life might have helped him avoid more serious issues later.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years mostly with marijuana and some time feeling down. The history of using drugs is concerning because substance abuse can lead to relapse. But he's recently felt so down that nothing could cheer him up, which might indicate he's not seeking help or is feeling isolated emotionally. This could make him more prone to reoffending.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with it. That's interesting because many people believe in the idea of redemption or a divine plan for everyone. If he's influenced by that belief, maybe he has a stronger sense of purpose or hope. However, personal experiences and emotions can still play a role too.\n\nIn terms of family life, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3. That seems small, but families can have varying effects on someone's mental health, especially if they're raising young kids. Maybe it provided some stability before dealing with adult responsibilities.\n\nHe doesn't mention being involved in any clubs or organizations. That might suggest that he wasn't actively engaged outside of work and family, which could be a protective factor because sometimes more involvement can lead to issues later on.\n\nLooking at his substance use history: 4 years using marijuana and some time feeling down. The recent experience seems like a significant problem. If he's been dealing with drugs for four years, that's probably a lot of time in a recovery process or dealing with relapse. It could make him more vulnerable to recidivism.\n\nHis living situation: living alone is often associated with less social interaction and potentially lower risk factors. But living alone isn't the only issue; he also has been married once before. So, it's not just about his current living status but how he's lived in the past.\n\nHe hasn't mentioned anything about substance use elsewhere or other issues like substance abuse, mental health problems, etc.\n\nPutting this all together: age is a risk factor because young people often have less experience and resources compared to older individuals. Education level might influence if they're willing to commit further, but it's not the only factor. Recent substance abuse shows there was an issue that could affect recidivism. Family life in a small household might offer some support before dealing with more serious responsibilities.\n\nHowever, living alone is another risk factor because being single can lead to feelings of isolation and lack of social support, which might contribute to reoffending.\n\nSo overall, these factors suggest that the person has a higher likelihood of recidivism within the next three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young age\", \"medium\", \"20-year-olds tend to have less experience and resources compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"family living alone\", \"high\", \"single status can contribute to feelings of isolation and lack of social support before dealing with more serious responsibilities\"),\n    (\"recent substance use (marijuana 4 years, dumps feeling down)\", \"medium\", \"significant relapse history indicates vulnerability to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
