    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants me to assess the recidivism risk for this individual over three years. Let's see, he's a 22-year-old male, White, who has been arrested three times and convicted. He's not married yet but is living alone now. His education is high school without college, and he's lived with his biological mother in a rural area. He uses marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nFirst, I should consider each factor separately. The household size being small might mean more single parents, which could affect mental health or family dynamics. Rural living could be isolating for someone who has had family issues, like living with his biological mother before. The lack of college education means he's not getting a degree, which might impact job prospects.\n\nHe uses marijuana, so I should think about how that affects him. It can cause stress and sometimes relapse, but it doesn't seem to be a severe issue here. No recent depression is mentioned, so maybe that's less concerning.\n\nIn terms of recidivism risk, being married or not could increase the risk because people in relationships face higher rates. Living alone might also raise it due to isolation and stress. The lack of college education adds another layer since that's a hurdle for finding work or further education.\n\nPutting it all together, even with three arrests and convicted, he's still young and hasn't had much experience. However, the factors like living alone and being single don't seem too severe. Maybe his risk isn't extremely high but could be on the higher side.\n</think>\n\nThe recidivism risk for this individual over a three-year period is relatively low to moderate. Despite past arrests and convictions, he has not been convicted of violent crimes or delinquent behavior in a way that would significantly increase recidivism rates. He also faces fewer factors contributing to his risk compared to someone with access to higher education, living in a family setting, or facing more serious mental health challenges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"not living with children or other close family members is associated with lower recidivism rates compared to those who live in families\"),\n    (\"single status\", \"low\", \"the risk of criminal behavior increases in single individuals due to reduced social support and potential isolation\"),\n    (\"no college education\", \"low\", \"university educated individuals generally have higher recidivism rates due to the demand for higher education and employability\"),\n    (\"use of marijuana\", \"medium\", \"marijuana is a known modality for anxiety, stress, or mood disorders but does not indicate a high risk of reoffending in this context\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
