    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who hasn't been convicted of any crime. He's never married and lives alone, which might make him seem isolated, but it doesn't necessarily indicate recidivism. His family is small, rural, and he's raised in a household with his biological mother. That seems pretty stable.\n\nHe has one job during the year and hasn't been involved in any serious crimes. The fact that he used marijuana in the past four years might raise some red flags, but I'm not sure if that's enough on its own for recidivism. Plus, he didn't feel depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign.\n\nHe comes from a household of size 6 and lives alone. Being raised in such conditions can sometimes lead to issues down the line, like mental health problems or social isolation, but again, not sure if that's a significant risk for recidivism.\n\nI don't think he has any high-level criminal behavior or substance abuse patterns that would suggest recidivism. His age, lack of education, and living alone might limit his opportunities to reoffend. But without more serious factors like substance use or mental health issues, it's hard to say he'll reciditivate.\n\nI should consider if he has any personal struggles. He says God is part of his life, which could be a positive aspect but not necessarily a risk factor for recidivism. His family size and living situation make me think he's in a relatively stable environment, which might reduce his likelihood of reoffending compared to someone from a less stable background.\n\nOverall, while there are some positive aspects, especially regarding being raised by his biological mother and living alone, I don't see significant factors that would strongly suggest recidivism. Therefore, my prediction is NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"unrelated personal struggles\", \"low\", \"His family size and living situation make him appear stable, but his personal background doesn't inherently increase his risk for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family and living conditions\", \"low\", \"Being raised in a small, rural household with no children suggests stability, while living alone may offer some isolation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
