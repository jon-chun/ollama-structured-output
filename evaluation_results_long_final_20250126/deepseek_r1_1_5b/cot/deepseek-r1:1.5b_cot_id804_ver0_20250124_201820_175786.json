Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. That might indicate some underlying issues, but her current life situation is important too. She's been arrested seven times and convicted, which is quite high. With 7 convictions in three years, that's a significant number, especially if she hasn't engaged in any substance abuse or dropped out of school since completing high school.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 139 lbs. That doesn't seem particularly concerning on her own. The household size is 3, which is manageable, but the mother is her biological parent\u2014sometimes a mix can indicate something unusual, but she doesn't mention anything drastic here.\n\nShe has two jobs during the year and hasn't used drugs in the past four years. She's currently feeling down, so substance abuse might be an issue. She considers God to have something to do with her personal life, which is interesting, but I need more context on how this plays out next.\n\nSince she's been arrested seven times, that's quite a high number for someone of this age and background. Her convictions are likely tied to her substance use and possibly family dynamics. The low education level might mean she hasn't fully explored her options or has difficulty working on his own.\n\nShe is living alone now, which could be concerning, especially if others care about her well-being. The lack of a GED doesn't necessarily indicate mental health issues unless it's linked to substance use or family conflicts.\n\nPutting this all together, the high number of convictions and her substance use history suggest she might face higher recidivism risks. But I need to weigh other factors like her age, current state, and financial stability. With her past convictions tied closely to substance use, that could compound her risk further.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis based on the thought process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    {\n      \"factor1\": \"high\", \n      \"textual reasoning\": \"The individual has been convicted multiple times, which suggests underlying issues such as substance use and family dynamics.

However, this could still pose some concerns in the long run.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
