    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign a risk factor weight for this person. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White heritage. She's an engaged student, which means she might have some academic support systems in place. Maybe that could help her with reoffending. So, I think this is medium risk.\n\nNext, she's never married and living alone. Having no family around could be a significant barrier to reintegration into society. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is still in college. This might limit her opportunities or knowledge, which could contribute to criminal behavior. Medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. I don't think this directly affects recidivism because it's about substance abuse rather than decision-making. So, maybe low risk for drug use related factors.\n\nShe's never felt depressed over the last month. That's a positive emotional factor but not a direct cause of reoffending. Low risk here as well.\n\nShe comes from a household of three in an urban area with adults other than parents. Urban areas might have more opportunities, but it could also increase criminal behavior due to different social dynamics. Medium risk.\n\nAs a 22-year-old, she's young and hasn't lived with others for long. This could lead to feelings of isolation or uncertainty about reintegration. High risk factor because she feels alone.\n\nI think the highest risk is the living situation in an urban household. The other factors are more manageable but not certain. So I'll assign medium weight. \n\nFor prediction, given her circumstances, especially being young and possibly alone, it's a high chance she might recidivate. But since there are some supportive systems, maybe not extremely likely.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"resiance in urban household\", \"medium\", \"She is from a young, isolated household in an urban area, which can lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about reintegration.\",\n    (\"no family support\", \"high\", \"Living with adults other than biological parents can increase feelings of uncertainty and isolation, potentially contributing to reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
