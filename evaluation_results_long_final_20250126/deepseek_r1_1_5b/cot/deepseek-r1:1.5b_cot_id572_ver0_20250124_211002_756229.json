They're 22, White, living alone with no kids, and have a history of drug use. Their parents were there as a rural household of size four.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors mentioned. The person is Black, living in a rural area, which might be more dangerous. But they're White, so that's different. They've been arrested multiple times, showing recidivism risk. High school diploma but not enrolled, maybe less education compared to others with the same age and status.\n\nThey've used drugs before four years, which is a significant recidivist indicator. They haven't felt depressed for over a month, so that's positive. Their upbringing in rural areas could add some stress.\n\nI think their Black heritage makes them more at risk compared to White males from other backgrounds. The rural setting and lack of college education might lower their chances, but the drug use is a strong factor. I'll assign medium weight to each risk factor. \n\nLooking at recidivism rates, a history of past convictions and substance abuse makes them high risk. Factors like living alone also contribute. So overall, yes with medium weights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black heritage\", \"medium\", \"residents of predominantly African American communities are more likely to reoffend in the U.S.), \n    (\"low education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma not yet completed makes it harder for young individuals to avoid recidivism compared to those with higher levels of education\"), \n    (\"rural setting\", \"medium\", \"rural living conditions can make recidivism more likely than urban settings because of lower social support and community engagement\"), \n    (\"low college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"not enrolled in college makes it harder for young individuals to enter the criminal justice system compared to those who are actively seeking higher education or training during their Juvenile delinquency stage\"), \n    (\"previous drug use\", \"medium\", \"consistent history of substance abuse is a strong indicator of recidivism\"), \n    (\"low self-esteem/depression over past month\", \"medium\", \"positive and low depression can boost mood, but the lack of feelings of despair in this individual could be mitigated by positive outlook and support from family/friends/friends/family\"), \n    (\"low living alone status\", \"medium\", \"residents who live alone are more likely to reoffend than those who are living with their partners because of higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and lack of social support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
