    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user wants a risk assessment for rearrest recidivism for a 19-year-old female. She's 5'5\", 127 lbs, single, in school, with a history of drug use without depression. She identifies God as not relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider factors like age, marital status, living alone, education level, substance abuse, and mental health. Since she's single, that's a plus for family support but still risky if others are around. High on living alone and being single probably lowers recidivism because of stability.\n\nHer education level is school at present, which might influence how serious the situation gets when applying for jobs or housing. But even with some experience in the job market, she needs support from neighbors. That's a risk but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nShe's single and has lived with biological parents in a small household of 5. This provides a bit of stability, especially if their kids are around. The modest size might mean less stress, which could reduce recidivism factors related to family pressure.\n\nDrug use without depression is concerning. It shows vulnerability, but she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Still significant enough that it's worth considering as a risk factor. Her substance abuse history might increase recidivism risks if others know about it, so need to balance it with awareness of her own experiences.\n\nOverall, her factors are a mix of moderate risk due to living alone and single, high on substance use without external help, but low in other areas like age or marital status. The confidence level would be medium because while there's some risk, she has multiple support systems in place.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"She is living with her biological parents and belongs to a small household of size 5, which could make it more challenging for her to seek housing or access resources from others.\",\n    \"medium\", \"She is single, but family support may be more significant than just living alone.\",\n    \"low\", \"While she has lived alone in the past, it's not clear how her ability to find a home would impact recidivism.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 127 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
