    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking me to act as a criminal risk assessment expert. They provided a detailed scenario about a young woman who's been arrested once and has been convicted. The user wants me to assess her risk factors for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each risk factor step by step. Let me list out all the factors given:\n\n1. Age: 21\n2. Gender: Female\n3. Race: White\n4. Number of arrests: 1\n5. convictions: Yes\n6. Height: 5'4\"\n7. Weight: 125-149 lbs\n8. Marital status: Single\n9. Location: Urban area\n10. Job history: 4 jobs in a row\n11. Past drug use: High doses of marijuana and cocaine, no depression for past month\n12. Family background: Lived with biological mother in household of 4, considered by God\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor.\n\nAge (21): Not too young, so not high risk but also not low.\nGender (Female): Women are more at risk than men for recidivism, even after controlling for other factors.\nRace (White): White populations often have lower recidivism rates compared to other racial groups. It depends on the specific community context.\nNumber of arrests: 1 arrest is a small number. Recidivism isn't guaranteed with just one past offense.\nConvictions: Yes, she's convicted, which affects her recidivism status.\nHeight (5'4\"): Not extremely tall; can be both a factor and not.\nWeight (125-149 lbs): Within a typical weight range for urban singles.\nMarital status (Single): Single individuals may have different factors than married ones. Urban vs rural also matters.\nLocation (Urban area): Urban might offer certain opportunities, but crime rates can vary.\n\nJob history: 4 jobs in a row suggests stability, which might reduce recidivism risks. But some people can change careers.\nPast drug use: She used high doses of marijuana and cocaine, which are known to increase recidivism risk. No depression over the past month doesn't directly affect her current behavior but could be a factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4. This may have psychological or family dynamics that influence recidivism.\nGod's involvement: As an individual, it's difficult to attribute divine influence on an already-arrested person's behavior. It might not be a significant factor.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors, I think the recidivism risk is moderate. The number of arrests and convictions are important but don't alone define it. The family background and living with a biological parent could have psychological support, which is positive. However, drug use is still a significant factor contributing to higher risk. Since she's in an urban area and has stable job history, those factors might mitigate some risks.\n\nSo, overall risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status\", \"single\", \"She is single and resides alone, which may provide psychological support for recidivism.\",\n    \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"5'4\\\"\", \"She is of average height, neither extremely tall nor short.\")\n    ],\n    (\"Marital status\", \"single\", \"She is single and resides alone, which may provide psychological support for recidivism.\",\n    \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"5'4\\\"\", \"She is of average height, neither extremely tall nor short.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
