    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking me to assign risk factors for a 18-year-old female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She's 5'4\" and 130 lbs, single, in school now. She's lived with her dad in a family of four before and is living alone now. She used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and has felt down in the dumps for the last month when nothing felt right. At a young age, she lives with her biological dad in an urban area, and it seems like God might be involved.\n\nI need to evaluate each risk factor: mental health, substance use history, family dynamics, living situation, prior arrests, and gender/marital status. \n\nMental health is a big one here because she's dealing with feelings of downeyness from her own experiences, which can affect recidivism. Substance use\u2014she has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has been on the streets for up to five months now. That's significant and could contribute.\n\nFamily dynamics are important too. She's lived with her dad in a family of four before but is now living alone, which might indicate strained relationships or lack of support systems. The fact that she considers God involved adds another layer because it can affect mental health.\n\nLiving situation\u2014she's single, in school, and living alone now. That could mean limited support networks or stress from not being around others. Her parents have lived together for four years but are now apart, which might be a concern.\n\nHer prior arrest is one time, so that's less significant compared to other factors. However, each arrest can still carry some risk, especially if it was an violent crime that made her feel worse about recidivism.\n\nGender and marital status\u2014she's female and single, which can sometimes correlate with higher rates of substance use or mental health issues. But since she's 18, her age isn't the primary factor here.\n\nNow, putting this together, I think she has several high risk factors: low mental health (mental health issues from her own experiences), moderate to high substance use (she used substances in the past four years and now is down on drugs for a while), family dynamics with limited support systems, living alone with no home, some prior arrest, gender/marital status affecting mental health.\n\nSo, combining all these, I'd say she's at a medium risk of recidivism. The high substance use and possibly her mental state from previous issues are significant. Family strain and living alone add to the stress, making it somewhat likely for her to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"mental health\", \"moderate\" | \"high\", \"driving under the influence (DUI) and experiencing low self-esteem from past experiences with feeling down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\"), \n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\", \"she has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
