    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual based on the provided information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. From what I know, being in her early twenties has certain factors that might be more concerning regarding mental health. She has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant positive step, but recidivism rates can vary based on many factors.\n\nShe's 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 135 lbs. While height isn't directly linked to criminal behavior, being taller might indicate better physical health, which could be protective rather than concerning. Her weight seems normal for her age, so I'm not sure if that affects anything.\n\nThis person has never been married and is living alone. As a single adult without a spouse can sometimes present as a risk because they're isolated, but it's also possible that this isolation might have helped prevent criminal behavior. However, since she's just started college, maybe her social life isn't too bad yet, which could reduce recidivism risks.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. This suggests she had access to education before being arrested, which is generally protective against recidivism because it builds a foundation of knowledge and skills that can help someone reintegrate into society. However, if she was involved in any criminal activities or had low academic performance, that could be concerning.\n\nShe's been holding 3 jobs during the year. This job history shows some stability, which might mean less stress and potential for mental health issues. It's more about how stable her employment is than anything else, but it's still a positive sign in terms of overall risk management.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is interesting because using substances can sometimes be linked to criminal behavior, especially if there's a risk of dependence or emotional instability. The lack of feelings of depression might offer some psychological support that could help reduce recidivism risks.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2 and lives in an urban area. This places her in a relatively stable environment compared to areas where crime is higher, but it's not necessarily a guarantee of safety because other factors can contribute to lower recidivism rates.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a small family setting. I'm not sure how that affects criminal behavior yet, but it might mean less stress and potentially better social support compared to larger families where there could be more strained relationships or increased pressures from authorities.\n\nPutting this all together, the person has positive steps\u2014being arrested once, being single, and holding 3 jobs\u2014so that's a plus. However, she hasn't been convicted of anything, which is a significant advantage. The lack of substance abuse, though, might be concerning if it affects mental health or behavior.\n\nHer living environment in an urban area versus other areas could influence recidivism rates, but since the household size was small and they were with their biological mother, maybe that's somewhat protective. She also hasn't had any negative experiences like drug use beyond past four years.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk of recidivism. The single status and lack of substance abuse could reduce the risk, but the absence of convictions is still a positive outcome. Recidivism rates can vary widely depending on many variables, so it's important to look at the specific context and individual circumstances.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"single_status\", \"medium\", \"unstable social environment compared to larger families\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"low substance use (no recent marijuana use) but may not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates due to lack of context\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"small family might offer more support and less stress than larger households\"),\n    (\"living_environment\", \"medium\", \"urban area can have higher crime rates compared to rural areas, though smaller families might mitigate some risks\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"low\", \"one conviction in a stable environment with positive behavior history is protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
