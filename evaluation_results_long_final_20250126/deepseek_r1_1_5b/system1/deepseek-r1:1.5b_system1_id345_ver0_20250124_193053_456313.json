    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given information. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag for being high-risk, but it does narrow things down. Next, he's been arrested once and has been convicted. That could indicate a criminal history, which might raise his risk factors. \n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 128 lbs. Those are pretty normal measurements for a young adult, so I don't think that's a concern.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone now. Marrying someone early on can sometimes affect mental health, but it doesn't automatically mean high risk. His weight isn't extreme either, so not sure about that.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and hasn't gone to college yet. That means he might still be in the workforce if he's young, which could tie into criminal activity. But again, it's just one point out of many.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. That suggests he's been working at least part-time or full-time, maybe with a side hustle. If that work experience has been linked to criminal behavior in the past, that could be a red flag. \n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using substances isn't a crime, but it's an alcohol use issue which might raise his risk factors for things like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe's raised his kids and living alone now. Young parents can influence someone else's behavior, especially if they're raising them with certain values or stressors. However, being living alone is different; that's a more serious concern regarding safety and security.\n\nHis family background\u2014rural area and God's role in his life\u2014are interesting. But unless there's specific evidence linking that to criminal activities, it doesn't directly raise the risk. \n\nPutting this all together, while he has some negative aspects like substance use and living alone, which are serious concerns about safety and security, and a family background that could potentially influence behavior, they don't necessarily indicate a high overall risk. Most of his other factors seem normal or within reasonable expectations for a 20-year-old. So maybe the confidence isn't very high because there's still some uncertainty.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if I've missed anything, but based on what I can see, it doesn't look like he has severe high-risk behaviors. It's more about safety and security than criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}",
