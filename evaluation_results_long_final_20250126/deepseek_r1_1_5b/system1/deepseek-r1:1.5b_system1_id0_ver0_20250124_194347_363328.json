    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and male, Hispanic. That's not immediately alarming because these groups are more common in the U.S., especially with higher rates of crime and poverty. But I need to look at other indicators.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and convicted. While that's concerning, it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk if he's under a protective order or has some form of social disorganization. Still, multiple convictions are an issue.\n\nHe's 5 feet 0 inches, which is tall for his age. That seems normal without any signs pointing to mental health issues or substance use disorders.\n\nHis weight range is between 150 and 174 lbs. For a guy his age, that's about right for average weight. He hasn't been married yet, so no family-related stressors.\n\nHe isn't living alone and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. That means he might be more likely to engage in criminal behavior because of lower education levels. Without a high school diploma, it could mean some barriers to accessing resources needed for rehabilitation or legal aid.\n\nHe's never been married but did live with his biological mother in an urban area six years ago. That doesn't necessarily indicate mental health issues unless there was some stress associated with that period.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These behaviors are concerning because they might suggest underlying mental health problems, especially if he hasn't been able to access proper medical help or has some form of substance use disorder.\n\nAt 18, living in a small family like six members suggests he's likely out of school by now and may have some mental health challenges that aren't being addressed properly. He might be in a vulnerable situation without adequate resources for intervention or treatment.\n\nI think all these points are pointing towards potential high risk behavior. The combination of education level, urban living, substance use, and family structure makes him more susceptible to issues that could lead to higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
