    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate this risk assessment for a person who's a 21-year-old female with mixed race origins. Let me break down each element step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old. That\u2019s actually quite young for someone who has been arrested twice and convicted. So that seems concerning. I should note that it's early in their life if they've already been convicted once without any prior convictions or arrests.\n\nNext, she identifies as mixed race. While racial identification can be significant, especially in criminal justice, I don't see why this would make them a high-risk individual. It might affect law enforcement but isn't a unique risk factor on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. That\u2019s a clear red flag. The number of convictions is alarming because it shows she's already undergone serious legal consequences. This suggests possible criminal behavior or past actions that could be exploited for crimes, which is high risk.\n\nHer age is another point. Being 21 means she might have had some prior offense or just reached the young adult stage where they're more likely to commit crimes. That\u2019s a critical factor because law enforcement agencies often focus on high-risk individuals in this age group.\n\nShe has used drugs specifically withcocaine for past four years and continues doing so now. This is significant because drug use can have serious consequences. It might involve criminal activity or addiction, which could escalate into criminal behavior if not managed properly.\n\nHer weight is 148 lbs, which is below average. This could indicate physical health issues that might be relevant in legal proceedings, but I don't see how this would directly contribute to her risk of committing crimes beyond what's already established by her past actions and convictions.\n\nMarriage status and living with her spouse: These are personal factors that can affect a person's criminal behavior but aren't specific enough for assessing the overall risk. It might indicate some vulnerability, but not necessarily high risk if other factors are more concerning.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a high school diploma or GED and isn\u2019t enrolled in college. This is a significant concern because it shows she hasn\u2019t attended school, which could mean potential criminal behavior if they lack proper education or legal training. However, this alone isn't enough to classify her as a high-risk individual; other factors like drug use and past convictions are more relevant.\n\nShe has held one job during the year but didn't mention any specific work related to the crimes. This makes it harder for me to assess whether she\u2019s engaged in criminal activities or if there's some hidden risk involved, especially given her past drug use.\n\nThe fact that she lived with her biological mother in a household of size three and is from an urban area might suggest potential higher risk profiles due to living conditions, but again, this isn't a unique risk factor. It\u2019s more about how the family structure interacts with criminal behavior rather than making someone inherently high-risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young (21), has multiple convictions in two separate offenses, usedcocaine for past and current use, is from an urban area, and doesn't have high school education or any college enrollment. All of these factors indicate significant risk, especially given her prior criminal history and drug use.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
