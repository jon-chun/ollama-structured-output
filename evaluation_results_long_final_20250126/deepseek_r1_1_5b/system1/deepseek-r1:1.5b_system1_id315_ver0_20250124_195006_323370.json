    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this query step by step. The user is asking about risk assessment factors for a 21-year-old individual. I need to evaluate each factor and determine if it indicates high risk.\n\nFirst, the person is 21, which sets an age threshold for criminal activity. That's a clear indicator of potential risks from age-related issues.\n\nHe's white, but race isn't considered in most risk assessments, so that might not be a significant factor here.\n\nArrested twice and convicted means he has serious past history, especially if the convictions were serious crimes like murder or rape, which are dangerous. But I'm not sure about the specifics of his convictions yet.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 160 lbs\u2014weight is on the lower side for his height, but maybe not a major risk factor depending on context.\n\nWeighted at 52% percentile suggests he's in the middle range, so not overly risky from that aspect.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse indicates isolation, which can sometimes lead to higher crime rates. But again, it depends on the situation and context.\n\nNo marriage means no sexual relations, but that might reduce risks associated with sexual assault or other age-related issues like domestic violence. However, it's not a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nCurrently living alone suggests he's part of a family without children, which can sometimes lead to increased criminal behavior. But again, it depends on the specific circumstances and context.\n\nA high school diploma isn't a bad thing in itself; it just means his education level is below college. But without higher education, he might lack some legal or professional knowledge that could affect risk assessment.\n\nNot enrolled in college implies he's not pursuing further education, which might limit opportunities for learning criminal justice skills. This could be a risk factor because gaining necessary skills might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year\u2014his previous job may have contributed to his current behavior; the last job could have had negative impacts on his mental health or criminal behavior. His drug use over four years indicates he's using substances, which is dangerous. Also, not feeling depressed in the past month shows he might be seeking solace while being involved with criminal activities.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area\u2014this is a significant risk factor because living in a high-crime environment like a city increases the likelihood of crime-related issues affecting someone's well-being. Urban areas often have higher rates of violent crime, poverty, and substance abuse.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with his personal life adds a spiritual component but doesn't inherently increase criminal risk unless combined with other factors like substance use and stress.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of past convictions (likely serious crimes), living in an urban high-crime area, substance use, and isolation suggest significant risks. However, these are not the sole indicators; context matters.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
