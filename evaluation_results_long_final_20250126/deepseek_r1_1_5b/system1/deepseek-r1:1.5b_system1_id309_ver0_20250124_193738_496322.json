    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given risk factors indicate high risk for someone being arrested again at 18 years old. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 18, which is a high school age, but he hasn't had any college yet. That might mean he wasn't prepared for university-level studies or jobs. However, since he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White and has been arrested once, maybe the previous experience isn't too significant.\n\nNext, he's never married and lives alone. Maybe that affects his relationships with others, but it doesn't directly relate to his potential for re-arresting again. Plus, he's under 21 at the time of arrest, which is a legal age in many places, so he might not be considered an adult yet.\n\nHis height (5'11\") and weight (153 lbs) are average for that age group, but some tall, thin individuals can face more mental health issues. But here, he hasn't used drugs in the past four years except for marijuana and cocaine. That's significant because substance abuse is a serious issue, especially for young people.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month either. That might be concerning because if someone has been in poor mental health for several months, it could lead to re-arrest or other issues like gang involvement or delinquency.\n\nThe fact that he's from an urban household of size 2 and considers God involved is interesting. It adds some spiritual or religious factors but doesn't necessarily mean he's at risk of re-arresting again. It's more about his personal beliefs than criminal behavior.\n\nLooking at his education level (high school diploma, 2-year college) suggests that he may have potential for higher education, but since he's still an 18-year-old, it's unclear if that would lead to criminal activities. Plus, he hasn't held any jobs yet, which could mean he's not ready for the demands of a job or related criminal activity.\n\nLastly, his living situation (alone) might affect his ability to seek help from family or friends, but again, it doesn't directly indicate re-arrest risk. The key here is substance abuse and mental health issues over the past four years.\n\nSo, putting this all together, while he's an 18-year-old with potential, the lack of prior substance use and mental health issues makes me lean towards not high risk, but I'm still a bit cautious because substance abuse is a serious factor. However, without evidence showing prior delinquency or specific criminal activity beyond substance use, it might be considered low risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": \"65\"\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
