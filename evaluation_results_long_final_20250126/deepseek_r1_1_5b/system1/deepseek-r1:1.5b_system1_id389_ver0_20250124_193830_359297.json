    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether a person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, White, and he's been arrested once. That seems concerning because arrest can be serious, but it doesn't necessarily mean immediately dangerous behavior. Maybe someone was in an accident or something similar.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone. Single individuals are generally safer than those who are already married, so that's a positive sign. He has a 5'10\" height and weighs 165 lbs. That\u2019s within the typical range for his age and gender. His high school diploma but not in college makes him at least somewhat educated.\n\nHe's been employed three times during the past year. Having worked doesn't guarantee safety, though it could affect his mental state if he's under stress or dealing with personal issues. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That\u2019s good to know about substance abuse and mental health.\n\nHe considers God having something to do with his life but hasn\u2019t mentioned anything specific. This could be a sign of spiritual involvement, which might have implications, especially if he's been going through personal struggles. But without more info, it's hard to tell if that affects his safety.\n\nHis background includes living in a rural area with his biological mother for four kids and considering God involved. That could mean his behavior is influenced by societal expectations or his faith, but it doesn't directly indicate risk factors like substance use or mental health issues.\n\nPutting this all together, while he hasn't been arrested yet, being single, having a decent education, and no recent substance use adds up to low risk factors. The arrest rate might be high for someone his age in that area, but unless there's clear evidence of immediate danger, it's probably not high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}",
