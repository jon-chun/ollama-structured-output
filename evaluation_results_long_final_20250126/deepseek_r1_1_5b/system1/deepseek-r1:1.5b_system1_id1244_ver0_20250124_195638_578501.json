    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from Black descent. That's interesting because Black people have some unique traits in criminal justice, but does that necessarily increase their risk? Not sure yet.\n\nHe's arrested once but not convicted. The risk isn't just about arrest; it's about conviction too. Maybe the first offense carries some weight, especially if he has other negative behaviors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHis age is below 21, which might suggest more serious behavior. But since he's a minor, it's still concerning.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 148 lbs. That doesn't seem particularly tall or unhealthy for his age, but again, this is about weight and size, not criminal history.\n\nHis height isn't an issue here because the factors are more about body measurements than physical attributes. So I'll keep that in mind.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marrying someone is a big deal, but if he's single, it might be less concerning unless other issues like substance abuse or mental health come into play.\n\nHis family size is 5, including his biological mother. This is interesting because having a biological parent can affect his mental state, especially in young adulthood. Maybe living with his mom would have some impact on his behavior.\n\nHe's from an urban area and doesn't live alone. Urban living might lead to more stress or issues related to the environment, which could be relevant.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college right now. This is still education level, not necessarily an issue unless there are gaps or if he hasn't attended school for a while.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college and hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. No substance use history. Maybe substance abuse was low or none at all.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month either. That's positive information because it shows his mental health isn't an issue yet.\n\nHis background includes living with his biological mother as a minor, considering God might influence him personally. This is interesting because it touches on family dynamics and spiritual influences, which could be significant in criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal record, but not a conviction. His age is below 21, which is concerning. His living alone with his biological mother could affect mental health. The high school diploma might indicate some education level, though not necessarily problematic. No substance use or depression history. Maybe family dynamics and spiritual influences from the early life contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards him being at risk because of his age, past convictions, possibly living alone (which is concerning for mental health), and maybe some background related to family dynamics or spirituality that could influence criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
