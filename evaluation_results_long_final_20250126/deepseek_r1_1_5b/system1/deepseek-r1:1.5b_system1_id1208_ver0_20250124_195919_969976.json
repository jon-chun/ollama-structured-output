    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the provided information. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old and identifies as Black. They've been arrested once and convicted, which suggests they might have criminal history. They're 6'0\" and weigh 145 lbs, not extremely tall but in a high weight class for their age. They\u2019re single now and living alone. Not many people of this age are single or living alone, especially if they\u2019ve been arrested.\n\nThey don\u2019t have a high school diploma or GED and aren\u2019t enrolled in college. That\u2019s a concern because it might indicate some form of education gap, which could affect their ability to handle the consequences of being caught. Their two jobs during the year mean they\u2019re employed, but maybe not as much as someone with a higher education degree.\n\nHe\u2019s used drugs before\u2014specifically marijuana for past four years and more recently felt down in the dumps, which is serious. This is concerning because drug use can lead to mental health issues and can be dangerous if not dealt with properly. The fact that he's lived with his biological mother as a child in a household of size 4 suggests he\u2019s part of a family, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there are other issues.\n\nAt a young age, living alone might affect their independence and ability to support themselves financially or handle responsibilities on their own. This could lead to financial instability if they can't sustain the cost of living. Additionally, being single at 18 is unusual but not impossible; it's something to consider regarding societal factors that may influence such behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some red flags like criminal history, drug use, and living alone, the person hasn't been caught of any severe crimes or taken drastic action. They\u2019re single now, which might indicate potential issues with financial independence, especially if they have no support system to rely on. The household size in the past doesn\u2019t seem too concerning either.\n\nTherefore, I would say this person is not at high risk based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
