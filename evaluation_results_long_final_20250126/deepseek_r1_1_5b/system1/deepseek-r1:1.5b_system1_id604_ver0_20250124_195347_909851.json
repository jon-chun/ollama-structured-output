    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess if this person is at high risk based on the provided factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That seems neutral, but since he's young and single, it might indicate some underlying issues with social interactions or relationships.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. While criminal behavior is a concern, an arrest without conviction could lead to more serious consequences over time, so that's something to watch out for.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5 feet 6 inches and 202 lbs. While size can be concerning, they're within average ranges, especially in young people. His weight might suggest muscle build or maybe health issues, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHe never married and is living alone. That's a significant risk factor because being single for a long time can lead to issues like substance abuse, financial instability, and strained relationships with others. He hasn't been married, so that's a big red flag.\n\nHis education: has a GED and not enrolled in college. GEDs are common, but lack of formal education could be concerning, especially if he's had problems with school or struggled to keep up. Being non-college-educated might indicate some gaps in knowledge or skills.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents as a teenager in a household of size 10. That's unusual for his age and indicates that he was raised by others before being separated. It might have contributed to issues like substance use, financial stress, and social awkwardness when moving out.\n\nHis drug history: used marijuana in the past four years and some time during the past month made him feel so down. This is concerning because using substances can lead to serious health problems, and his emotional state suggests he might be struggling with addiction or mental health issues.\n\nBeing young at 22 means he's too young for many responsibilities, which could increase stress and stress from potential future challenges like being single, dealing with substance abuse, financial instability, etc. His current living situation as an adult is also a problem because he needs to support himself while looking for work or other responsibilities.\n\nThere's no information about his criminal past beyond one arrest without conviction. That might indicate that he hasn't committed serious crimes yet but could be on the rise if he starts doing something wrong again.\n\nHis substance use history: being non-college educated and past drug use is concerning, especially with recent substance abuse. It's a clear sign of potential problems that could lead to addiction or more serious issues down the line.\n\nLiving alone as an adult in a small household of 10 suggests he needs to build some financial and social support, which might be challenging. Single living can also affect his relationships and ability to make good choices about his future.\n\nHis emotional state is described as feeling down when substance use happened recently. This could indicate underlying issues that may not improve with treatment but still present a risk of negative outcomes if he doesn't address them.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors point towards significant risks, especially regarding substance abuse, lack of education, living alone, and potential emotional vulnerabilities. These are all signs of high-risk behavior that could lead to serious consequences.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
