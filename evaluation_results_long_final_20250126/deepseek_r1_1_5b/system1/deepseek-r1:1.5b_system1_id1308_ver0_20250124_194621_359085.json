    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old and a male of Black descent. That might indicate some underlying issues related to race, but I'm not sure yet. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because it shows he's facing serious consequences in the legal system. His height and weight aren't extreme, so that doesn't seem like a significant factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. That's average for his age, so no problem there. He's lived alone without a partner, which might be a sign of isolation or stress from not having someone around him. The person mentioned has never been married, which is interesting because he could have had children if he was older.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That means he's starting life without much education, which might make him feel isolated and disconnected. He hasn't worked and used his skills since the past four years, so that shows economic strain. Most of the time during the last month, he felt down, nothing could cheer him up. That emotional state is concerning and might indicate poor mental health.\n\nHe's from an urban household of size five with his biological mother and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. These factors could contribute to stress, social isolation, or lack of support at home. The person also mentioned that God has something to do with his situation, which is interesting because it adds a spiritual angle but isn't conclusive.\n\nPutting this together, the arrest history, living alone, lack of education, economic issues, and poor emotional state all point towards potential high risk. His background from an urban area, lack of support at home, and feeling down make him more susceptible to negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
