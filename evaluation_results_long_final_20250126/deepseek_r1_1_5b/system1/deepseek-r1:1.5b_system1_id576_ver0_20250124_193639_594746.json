    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. That's not a red flag\u2014most people of that age identify with their parents' races. So no immediate concern here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's definitely a red flag. Convictions are serious and can lead to severe consequences, especially for someone in their early adulthood. If she's been caught doing something wrong, it could indicate delinquency or criminal behavior that needs attention.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 185 lbs. That seems healthy for her age, but I should consider any health issues mentioned later. Since the weight is in a reasonable range and there's no mention of anything concerning, this doesn't raise red flags yet.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. While being married can be an area of concern, especially if it affects family dynamics or mental health, that doesn't seem to be a major risk factor here unless specific issues arise from the marriage itself.\n\nMarried doesn't automatically make someone high risk in criminal justice. However, any relationship conflicts could pose problems, but without more info, I don't think this is the cause of concern.\n\nShe's not a high school graduate or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That might be concerning because many 21-year-olds are entering the workforce by then. If she hasn't completed education, that could affect her career prospects and mental health if there were any issues with it. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs during the year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, and doesn't feel depressed over the past month. The drug use is concerning because it can lead to serious health problems like addiction or mental health issues. Combined with her not feeling well, this could indicate a higher risk of severe consequences.\n\nAt 21, living with adults other than biological parents in an urban area\u2014this might affect family dynamics and potentially mental health issues, but again, without specific concerns about relationships or mental health, it's unclear if this is high risk.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life. This could indicate a belief in spiritual influence on behavior, which can sometimes lead to criminal behavior due to attachment. However, without more specific evidence linking this to criminal activities, it might not be classified as high risk.\n\nOverall, the most concerning factors are her conviction history and the drug use. The weight is reasonable, but if she's been convicted again for similar offenses or has a history of delinquency, that would indicate potential high risk. Her age and potential relationship issues could also play into this. Without more specific information on how these behaviors have affected her well-being in relation to criminal activities, it's challenging to classify this person as at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"30\"\n}",
