    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That seems concerning because arrest without conviction could indicate a serious issue. His height and weight are normal for his age, so that doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nHe's 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 220 lbs. Those stats look standard unless there's some hidden health problem or behavior related to being arrested. But I'm not sure about the exact connection yet.\n\nHe hasn't been married or ever been married, but he's currently living alone. That's a significant gap because single individuals are more prone to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which could affect their risk of arrest or conviction.\n\nHe's enrolled in school right now and has held one job during the year. That shows he's stable financially and possibly academically, but it doesn't directly relate to his criminal record unless there's some connection I'm missing.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Those are positive signs. But wait, being a 19-year-old who identifies as White might have some underlying issues. Maybe his family background or cultural factors could influence how he reacts to stress or other negative events.\n\nThe mention of living with his biological father in a household of size three suggests he's part of the family, which is common but doesn't inherently indicate a serious risk unless there are deeper issues within the family dynamics affecting him.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it brings in a spiritual element. However, without more context or evidence linking this belief system directly to criminal behavior, it's hard to assess a high risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest without conviction is significant, but without knowing the underlying cause or how he handles stress from that situation, it's still a concern. His stable background, positive habits, and well-being are positive indicators, but the arrest itself might be a red flag.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}",
