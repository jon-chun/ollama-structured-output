Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That\u2019s neutral and doesn't indicate anything suspicious yet. She has been arrested once and has been convicted, so that's clear. She\u2019s 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 135 lbs\u2014these are pretty normal body measurements for her age.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t married, is single now, and not living alone. That doesn\u2019t seem problematic on its own. She has a high school diploma and is in college, which suggests she's educated but maybe not with much job experience yet. She\u2019s enrolled in a 4-year college\u2014again, that could mean she\u2019s still looking for employment.\n\nShe\u2019s had three jobs during the year, so some part of her income is from work, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily show high risk. She hasn't been married and is currently not living alone, which isn't particularly concerning either. The drug history includes using marijuana in the past four years, but that's usually a mild form of drug use. She\u2019s not feeling depressed over the past month\u2014this could be worrying because substance abuse can affect mental health.\n\nHer family background: she lived with her biological mother in a small, urban household when she was young and considered it God\u2019s influence on her. That might make some people think there's something going on with her upbringing or genetics, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily pose a serious risk unless combined with other indicators like substance use or mental health issues.\n\nPutting it all together: While she has a drug history and is single, the other factors don't strongly suggest high risk. Unless those negative traits stack up with other risks, this person might not be at high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual's circumstances, while notable for their substance abuse and family background, do not collectively indicate a high-risk profile unless combined with significant mental health issues or other underlying risks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
