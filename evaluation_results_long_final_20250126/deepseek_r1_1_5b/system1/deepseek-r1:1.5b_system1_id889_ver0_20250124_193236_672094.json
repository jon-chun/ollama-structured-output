    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed scenario about a risk assessment expert analyzing various factors. They included age, gender, occupation, weight, marital status, education/certification, job history, substance abuse history, and personal beliefs. The task is to determine if these factors indicate high risk based on their confidence levels.\n\nI need to structure the response as a JSON object with \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". So I should map each factor to whether it's a risk indicator (YES or NO) and assign a confidence value between 0-100. \n\nStarting with age: 21 is young, so that might be a risk due to possible criminal behavior. But since they're arrested once, maybe not too high.\n\nGender: Black, though race can vary in impact. But given arrest history, possibly higher risk. Still moderate.\n\nOccupation: Criminals are common for certain professions. But since he's a 21-year-old male with arrest record, maybe more likely? Not sure.\n\nWeight: 210 lbs is average, not an indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nMarital status: Single and living alone could indicate issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. So yes, but moderate risk.\n\nEducation/certification: High school diploma or GED is a common background for crimes, so yes, but perhaps lower than other factors.\n\nJob history: No jobs in the past four years? That might affect his behavior because someone without job history could be less motivated to commit acts. So maybe yes, but less so than others.\n\nSubstance use: He used marijuana in the past four years and feels down in the dumps now. This is a clear sign of substance use disorder, which can lead to criminal behavior. That's a high risk indicator with very high confidence.\n\nPersonal beliefs: Living with his mother in an urban area, considering God's role. These are personal choices, not directly linked to criminal behavior unless belief affects decision-making, which might be a low risk factor but possible.\n\nNow, weighing each factor: Age and arrested multiple times could be risks, but since they're young, maybe not as high as others. Gender and race might influence, but arrest record suggests more. Job history being empty might mean less commitment. Education is common, so yes but lower. Substance use is clear and dangerous. Personal beliefs are subjective, which isn't a factor. marital status being single could indicate mental issues; personal living alone might too.\n\nSo for prediction: Probably high risk due to substance use disorder. But maybe not extremely high because of arrest history? Or perhaps moderate since they're young but have experience.\n\nConfidence levels would be higher for substance use and lower for other factors unless they directly link. So predicting a YES with confidence around 80-90, considering arrest record is a risk factor but less so than others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 19 times and has been convicted. He weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 8, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
