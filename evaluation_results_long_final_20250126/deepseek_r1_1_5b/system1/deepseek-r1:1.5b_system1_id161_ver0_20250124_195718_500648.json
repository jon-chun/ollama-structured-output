    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a detailed list of risk factors for a 19-year-old male. So, I need to assess each one and determine if it's a high-risk indicator.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old, which is quite young. At that age, most people are still in their teens or 20s. Young people often face more substance abuse because they're dealing with stress from school and social interactions. The fact that he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years suggests he might be engaging in illegal activities.\n\nNext, his family size is 4, which includes himself. This could mean he's raising a small group of kids, potentially leading to strain on his relationships. Living alone at this young age is concerning because it can make personal and emotional decisions harder without support from close family members. Being enrolled in school means he has academic responsibilities that might interfere with his decision-making abilities.\n\nHis job history shows he held three jobs during the year, which could mean a variety of work environments and job demands. This diversity could lead to inconsistent behavior or stress, increasing the risk of substance abuse. The fact that he's considered alone as a young adult suggests he might be in a vulnerable phase where stress from school and social activities makes him more prone to substance use.\n\nHe has never been married, which is significant because marriage often leads to emotional support and can sometimes trigger risky behaviors. Living alone without family support means he's not getting the emotional support that could help him cope with stress and potential substance abuse issues.\n\nHis drug history shows he's used both marijuana and cocaine, which are known substances, especially when combined in certain contexts like pot-aware\u9a7e\u9a76. This indicates a high risk because the combination can lead to dependency or addiction.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but being a 19-year-old who has lived on his own for four years means he's likely going through tough times. Dealing with chronic stress from various sources could contribute to feeling low and more susceptible to substance abuse and depression.\n\nOverall, each of these factors points towards potential high-risk behaviors because they are concurrent or cumulative risks. The combination suggests that the individual is at a vulnerable age where substance use and emotional distress are more likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
