    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert using advanced statistical and judicial knowledge. They provided specific risk factors for a 21-year-old male arrested multiple times, without high school education, living alone, and having substance abuse issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each risk factor. The person is a 21-year-old, which might make them a potential suspect in criminal activities. Having been arrested more than twice suggests they could be involved in multiple crimes or higher-level offenses. He's White, but race isn't typically the top risk factor unless there's specific evidence linking it to past crimes.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and 160 lbs, which are average weights for his age, so weight alone might not add much to his risk. His living situation as an orphan means he could be from a vulnerable area, but that doesn't necessarily raise his risk level significantly unless there's specific circumstances.\n\nHe has never been married and is single now, which might indicate past neglect or abuse issues since marriage often comes with such conditions. However, this alone isn't enough to assess a high risk level without more context.\n\nHis education is limited: no diploma or GED, but he's 21, so maybe some prior experience, but it's not clear how that would affect his risk beyond what other factors point to. He hasn't had any jobs since living at home with his mom, and while substance abuse has been a concern, the user specifically mentioned four years of drug use, mostly in the past month when he felt so down.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to assess each factor's likelihood against high risk. The arrest history is significant but not conclusive evidence of past crimes. His education background is minimal and doesn't directly relate to criminal activity unless it's tied to prior experiences. His living situation isn't a major risk factor on its own. The substance abuse issues are concerning, especially the recent dump experience, which could be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, without specific evidence linking these factors to past crimes or higher levels of criminal activity, I might lean towards \"NO\" as his overall risk level is moderate rather than high. But the user included the mention of living with his biological mother in a small family, which could have strained relationships and increased potential for abuse, but this still doesn't directly point to high risk without more context.\n\nI should consider that while he's at risk due to substance use, other factors like arrest history and education might not be as indicative. The living situation being an orphan adds some vulnerability, but it's not clear enough on its own. Therefore, my conclusion is probably \"NO,\" indicating a moderate risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
