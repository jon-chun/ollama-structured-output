    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's a racial identifier, which can sometimes be used for race purposes. She has been arrested twice and convicted. That's pretty serious, but I'm not sure how that directly affects her risk level unless there are specific factors linked to crime.\n\nShe's 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 135 lbs. Height is about average, though taller people usually have better balance issues in sports or games, but here it's just a physical measurement. Weight seems normal for her age, which might indicate she hasn't gained significant weight, so maybe not a health issue.\n\nShe never married and lives alone. That could affect family dynamics and social interactions. Living alone is unusual but possible, especially if they were separated. It can lead to stress or isolation, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHer education doesn't go beyond high school, which could put her at a disadvantage in certain fields. She's not enrolled in college either. That's concerning because higher education and better job opportunities are indicators of positive risk factors.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. This suggests she may have some professional experience or skills. However, holding multiple jobs can also lead to other issues like substance abuse or personal stress if she's busy with work.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. That's a serious drug use pattern. It could lead to mental health problems and affect her ability to function socially. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month is interesting but doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless it's coupled with other factors like substance abuse.\n\nAt 18, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size five in an urban area. That might be a mix of family dynamics and potential stress related to living alone in a larger community. It could lead to issues like anxiety or burnout if they're not well-connected or have other challenges.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal life. This is interesting because it ties her behavior to her beliefs, which can affect self-esteem and mental health. However, this doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there's an underlying cause of stress or negative factors from this belief.\n\nPutting all these together: She's a Black 18-year-old who has been arrested twice for drug use. The fact that she's single, living alone in an urban area with other family members might lead to significant social and mental health issues due to her lack of support systems. Her past drug use is serious but doesn't inherently make her a risk unless coupled with other negative behaviors.\n\nTherefore, I think this person has high risk factors related to substance abuse, possibly isolation, living alone in an urban area, and the combination of these with her racial identity which might be associated with higher stress levels.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
