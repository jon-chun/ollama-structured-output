They want me to assess if there are any high-risk factors based on their provided text.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old and a male. That already seems low risk because they're in their prime age. Also, they identify as Black, which might be a sign of something negative later on. But I should check other points.\n\nThey've been arrested three times but not convicted. That doesn't immediately make them high risk, but it's an important point to note about past behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and single, living alone. That's quite stable, no big issues there.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. That could be a red flag because it might indicate potential negative life events later on.\n\nHe's worked one job during the year and used drugs for four years. The fact that he used marijuana in the past four years (even some of the time) is concerning. Plus, he had down days that made him feel so low, which could lead to substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nAt 19, he lived in a household of size eight. That's smaller than average, but I don't see it as an indicator of high risk. Also, God's role is mentioned, which might be something to consider about his life choices later on.\n\nPutting all this together: age and stability are positives. The past drug use and recent down days indicate potential negative outcomes. The lack of education isn't the worst thing, but combined with a low income and no college, it could put more at risk. However, these risks aren't extremely high yet; they do need to be managed.\n\nSo, I think this person is on the edge of high risk, needing attention for substance abuse and mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
