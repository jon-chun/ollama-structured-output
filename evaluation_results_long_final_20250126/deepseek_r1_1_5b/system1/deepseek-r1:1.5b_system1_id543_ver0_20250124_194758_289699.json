    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and a male of White descent. That's good because many young people face legal issues, but since he's an experienced expert in criminal justice, maybe his background could help identify patterns or risks. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Being in jail without being convicted is concerning. That might indicate he's facing more than just a regular offense.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 220 lbs. That falls into the category of young adult males, which can sometimes be associated with criminal behavior or higher risk behaviors. He's never married yet and is living alone, which makes me think about his family background\u2014perhaps he has a strained relationship at home.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college right now. That could mean he's still developing skills, possibly leading to some criminal activity as he grows older. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are more about his mental health rather than criminal history.\n\nBut then there's this part: At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting because living with his parents as a teenager can sometimes lead to issues like domestic abuse or relationship stress. Since he's considered by God to have a personal influence on his behavior, it could hint at underlying psychological factors that might manifest into criminal activity later.\n\nPutting this all together: He's a young adult facing an arrest but not conviction. High school diploma vs. college level can indicate skill development that leads to criminal behavior as he ages. Living in a small family suggests possible stress or domestic issues from God's influence. Having a family on his own and living alone makes me think about potential family dysfunction, which could affect his personal relationships and future criminal activity.\n\nI'm not sure if all these factors point to high risk, but the combination of being arrested without conviction, living in a small household, having a non-colleging education, and considering God's influence on his behavior gives some clues. Maybe he has underlying issues that aren't addressed yet, which could lead him to commit crime later.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
