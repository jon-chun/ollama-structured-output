    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That could be an indicator of higher risk because Hispanic people might face more issues related to discrimination and poverty, especially in areas where they're from. But I'm not sure how significant that is here. Maybe it's something to consider, but the other points seem more relevant.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, so he's currently serving a sentence or facing some kind of consequences. That's a clear risk factor because being caught is serious and could have long-term effects on his life if he doesn't cooperate with authorities.\n\nNext, he weighs 180 lbs. I'm not sure how weight affects criminal risk. Maybe in tall people, it's more prone to certain issues like heart disease or muscle problems? But that seems less likely because other factors are mentioned first.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse, which could be a positive sign if they support him or have some joint efforts. However, without specific details on how they support him, I can't say much more about this point.\n\nHis height at 5 feet 9 inches might make him leaner, which could affect muscle mass and overall health. But again, not sure how that translates to criminal risk. It's a factor, but maybe it's secondary to other issues mentioned first.\n\nHe has a GED certificate, so he's educated. That\u2019s good because education can be an asset in the long run, but if his criminal record is still high despite being educated, it might still pose a risk. However, his arrest history and conviction could still make him at high risk regardless of his education level.\n\nHe has not used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are personal aspects that don\u2019t directly relate to criminal behavior but might indicate stability or emotional well-being. Not sure how relevant these are, especially if he's arrested, which could put his mental health at risk.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his life personally because of living with adults other than biological parents in a household of size two. This is an interesting point, but it seems more about personal beliefs rather than criminal risk factors. It might be a way to influence how he interacts with authorities or others, but I don't see how that affects his criminal record directly.\n\nPutting it all together: arrested once and convicted\u2014clear high-risk factor. Weight and height as factors are less relevant unless there's specific health concerns, which aren't mentioned. Family background is neutral because it doesn't address criminal behavior. Personal habits like drug use and depression don\u2019t impact criminal risk directly. His personal beliefs about God could influence how he interacts with authorities but not his criminal record.\n\nSo, the main high-risk factors are being arrested once and convicted. The other points either don't add significant evidence or are too vague to affect the risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
