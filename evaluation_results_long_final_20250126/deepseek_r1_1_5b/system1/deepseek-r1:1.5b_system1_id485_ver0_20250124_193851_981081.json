    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 18 years old, which falls within legal age for certain offenses. However, since the focus is on criminal justice, being an adult could mean potential crimes like assault or theft. But I should consider other factors too.\n\n2. **Gender and Race**: He identifies as White but doesn't specify African American or Hispanic. His race isn't highlighted, which might affect arrest statistics for specific groups. This could lead to issues in his criminal history analysis.\n\n3. **Arrest Record**: Charged once but not convicted. At least 10% of the U.S. population is arrested without conviction, so this is a valid risk factor with some support.\n\n4. **Height and Weight**: 5'9\" and 150-174 lbs are typical for an adult male. Not too extreme, but no significant outlier here.\n\n5. **Marriage Status**: Never married. Marriage doesn't directly affect criminal record statistics unless it's linked to a specific law or crime. So probably not high risk in this context.\n\n6. **Living Alone**: Currently living alone could be protective if someone dies, but since he's 18 and still alive, that might not apply here. Also, being with others increases the chances of committing something, so it's neutral.\n\n7. **School Enrollment**: Enrolled in school at present moment. This could mean higher potential for criminal conduct, especially if he's applying to college or starting a career. That seems like a strong indicator of high risk.\n\n8. **Job History**: Has held 1 job and used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. He has also felt down in the dumps during the last month. Drug use is a significant criminal history marker, especially if it's related to his behavior. This could indicate higher risk due to potential recidivism or more serious crimes.\n\n9. **God Connection**: The person considers God doesn't have anything to do with him personally. Since he's an adult, any relationship with God might be problematic and could affect criminal history analysis. However, this isn't a direct risk factor; it's more about how the data is interpreted.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors. He's in high school, used drugs (marijuana), has been down emotionally, which could lead to recidivism or more serious crimes. His arrest without conviction but having a criminal record history makes him at risk. Being alone while living might offer some protection against crimes, but combined with other issues like substance use and emotional turmoil, it seems high.\n\nSo, putting it together: Yes, significant risk due to multiple factors including drug use, emotional state, and the potential for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
