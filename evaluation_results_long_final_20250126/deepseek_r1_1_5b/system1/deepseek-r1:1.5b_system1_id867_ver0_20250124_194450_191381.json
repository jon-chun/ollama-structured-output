    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user provided a detailed profile of someone and asked if I can assess their risk level using certain factors. My task is to generate a JSON object with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and a confidence rating from 0 to 100.\n\nFirst, let me break down the risk factors given:\n\n1. The person is 19 years old.\n2. He's a male who identifies as White.\n3. He's arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet.\n4. His height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 160 lbs.\n5. He's never married, living alone now.\n6. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college.\n7. He's lived with his biological mother in a household of size four in an urban area.\n8. He used marijuana in the past four years and sometimes feels down, nothing to cheer him up\u2014this seems like a mental health issue.\n9. He holds two jobs during the year.\n\nNow, I need to assess each factor for risk. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. Age: 19 is relatively young, especially if they're a male. That might indicate lower risk in certain areas but could be a risk elsewhere depending on location.\n2. Identity as White: This is a social identity threat. If it affects their job prospects or relationships, that's a risk factor.\n3. Arrest history: Three arrests. In many places, this can lead to criminal charges, but if it's recent, maybe not as severe.\n4. Height and weight: 6'1\" seems tall for his age in urban areas without being exceptionally athletic. Weight is on the lower side for a 19-year-old.\n5. No marriage: In urban areas, especially where the city isn't too big, single people with no family can be risky if they're involved in criminal activities or have personal issues.\n6. Urban living alone: High crime rates and issues of safety in urban settings. Single individuals might face more risks due to isolation.\n7. Marijuana use: This is a serious mental health issue. The person's behavior could interfere with daily functioning, leading to possible legal issues if convicted.\n8. No college enrollment: If pursuing higher education isn't an option or is risky (like in some areas), this can be a barrier.\n9. Two jobs: Having another job might offer redundancy and stability but could also lead to stress or financial instability.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the person has been arrested multiple times without conviction, which suggests potential criminal behavior. His identity as White is a significant risk factor in urban areas. He's single living alone in an urban setting with possibly high crime rates. Marijuana use adds another layer of mental health concern. Without higher education and no other support options, this could be a serious threat.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors indicate a high risk for the individual. They face significant personal, social, and legal risks that could lead to criminal charges or even arrest again if caught.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
