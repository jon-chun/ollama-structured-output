    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is 21 years old, which makes them potentially a minor. The age category could be considered in terms of legal responsibility and potential for criminal activity. But typically, for risk assessment purposes, adults are more likely to engage in criminal activities than minors, but this isn't explicitly stated here, so I'll consider it.\n\nHe's Hispanic, which is a significant racial group historically involved in crime. However, individual factors like previous convictions or substance use can increase the likelihood of reoffending. Here, he has been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a positive sign about past behavior rather than risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and 240 lbs. Physical attributes don't inherently indicate criminal behavior; they're more about health status. This factor doesn't seem to be related to risk significantly.\n\nHis weight isn't a strong indicator of criminal behavior either. It's common for individuals to vary in weight regardless of their past actions.\n\nHe's never married, living alone, and hasn't had a high school diploma or GED. These are personal factors that don't directly relate to criminal history but could indicate potential stress or independence issues, which might affect legal consequences.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet, so it's unclear how that relates to past criminal behavior. Living alone is another factor; while this can be a sign of stability, it doesn't specifically tie into criminal risk unless previous convictions are part of the picture.\n\nHe has not been convicted or convicted in prior years and didn't commit crimes in the last four years. This suggests he's not at risk from past criminal activity but rather from potential reoffending.\n\nHis substance use includes marijuana and cocaine, which are substances with known links to criminal behavior, especially among minors. However, since he's a 21-year-old, it might be less common, but still a factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive aspect regarding mental health. This could contribute to better cognitive functioning and reduced stress, which are factors that don't directly indicate risk.\n\nHis upbringing as living with his biological mother in an urban area where God has an influence on personal life\u2014this is about family dynamics and environment. While it's important for overall well-being, it doesn't specifically relate to criminal behavior unless there were previous convictions linked to such influences.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while he hasn't been convicted or shows signs of substance abuse in the past four years, his age could make him more susceptible to engaging in criminal activities. However, this individual has a history of conviction and has never been convicted again, which raises some concerns about past behavior. Additionally, living alone might affect mental health, but it's not clear if that directly contributes to criminal risk.\n\nBut the primary risk factors here are his age as an adult, previous convictions, substance use, and living alone. These points do indicate a higher risk compared to minors with no prior convictions or substance abuse history.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
