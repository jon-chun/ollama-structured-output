    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk based on the given information. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: The person is 20 years old, Hispanic, and living alone. That doesn't sound too bad compared to other risk factors like substance abuse or being with family.\n\n2. **Arrest and Conviction**: She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Being a minor in this context might mean she's not eligible for a conviction yet, so that's manageable.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: 5 feet 1 inch and around 200-224 lbs. That seems normal for a 20-year-old. No issues here.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: She's never been married but is currently single, which isn't problematic for legal matters unless she's been with a biological parent in the past, which I don't see here.\n\n5. **Employment and Education**: Enrolled in school now means no part-time or full-time jobs, so that's straightforward.\n\n6. **Drug Use History**: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a bit concerning because drug use without conviction can have long-term effects, especially for minors.\n\n7. **Emotional State**: She's feeling down and depressed a lot, which is a serious issue. This could lead to mental health problems that complicate her legal situation.\n\n8. **Family Background**: lived with her mom in an urban area with six people. That doesn't seem like a major criminal risk factor on its own. The focus here seems more on her personal circumstances and substance use.\n\nPutting it all together, while the person is young and living alone, she's been arrested but hasn't convicted, which isn't a high risk. Her physical size and weight are normal, and her education progress is fine. However, the significant drug use without conviction, coupled with the heavy emotional burden from feeling down, do add up to create a higher risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
