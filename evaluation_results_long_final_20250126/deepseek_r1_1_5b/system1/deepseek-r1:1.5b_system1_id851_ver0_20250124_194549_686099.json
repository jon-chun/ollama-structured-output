    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess this risk for the person described. So, first off, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it makes me think about race and maybe identity issues, but I'm not sure how that directly affects criminal justice risk.\n\nHe's arrested twice and has been convicted. That seems like serious information. Being charged with multiple crimes could indicate past delinquency or a history of misbehaving in the community, which might raise red flags for his parents or family. But I don't know if that would make him more likely to commit a crime again based solely on past convictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 207 pounds. His height is average, so that doesn't add much risk information by itself. His weight seems normal too. As an adult, he's married with his spouse and living with them, which could indicate stability but I don't know if that correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college right now. That suggests he might have some work experience or been out of school for a while. But again, criminal risk isn't directly influenced by educational status unless there's a history of mis\u884c\u4e3a.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. That seems like another red flag because drug use can lead to problems and sometimes commit crimes, but I'm not sure if that's a direct indicator. However, it's something to consider as potential risks.\n\nHe hasn't experienced depression over the past month. Depression is a serious mental health issue that can affect individuals' behavior and potentially influence criminal behavior. So this could be significant risk information.\n\nAt 21, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size four. This might indicate he's raised by family members or has some community involvement experience, which could contribute to criminal behavior if there's family dynamics or group participation issues.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. That's an interesting statement. It ties his identity to the world around him, but I'm not sure how directly it would affect his criminal risk. However, identity and personal faith can influence legal perceptions of behavior.\n\nPutting all this together: past convictions, possible delinquency (due to being with family), weight and height which are average for 21-year-olds, no substance abuse in the past four years, depression over the last month (which is concerning), living with family members, and a belief in God's influence on his behavior. All of these factors suggest significant potential for criminal behavior or reoffending.\n\nTherefore, I think this person has high risk information that could lead to serious criminal actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
