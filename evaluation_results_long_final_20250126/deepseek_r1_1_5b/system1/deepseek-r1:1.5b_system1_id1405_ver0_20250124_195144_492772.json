    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for an individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male, which is quite young. Young people are more likely to be involved in criminal activities because they have less time to focus on personal relationships and social interactions. So that's a red flag.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which I know can lead to issues with race and law enforcement. Being of average height (6 feet 0 inches) is not too concerning unless it affects his physical health or mobility. He weighs 168 lbs, which seems about right for his age but doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested three times, convicted twice, and is currently in jail. This shows a history of past actions that have led to legal consequences, which is significant on its own.\n\nHis family size of 8 means he's lived with his biological mother as an 8-member household. That might be seen as less independent or even problematic, especially if the family is struggling financially and being beaten or beaten by someone else. However, it could also indicate a lack of social support which can be risky at such a young age.\n\nHe has never been married, living alone since a young age. This is concerning because single individuals are more vulnerable to criminal behaviors due to fewer social connections and the pressure not to engage in harmful relationships. Even though he's only 19, this might still pose significant risk, especially if his behavior hasn't improved since then.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This could mean he's self-sufficient or has other ways of getting financially supportable without needing college degrees. But it doesn't directly address criminal behavior unless the financial stability is linked to past criminal actions.\n\nHe's not currently looking for a job and hasn't been involved with any jobs during the year. His lack of work experience could be a red flag because criminal activity often involves significant joblessness or little-to-no income, especially if he has criminal history.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and has dealt with severe emotional distress related to feeling down for a while. This is concerning because substance use can lead to serious mental health issues. Also, experiencing such emotional turmoil at a young age might indicate underlying stress or anxiety that could be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 19, which places him in a transitional period between high school and college. Many students of this age have had previous violent experiences or issues with their families, making them more susceptible to criminal actions due to the weight of past trauma.\n\nOverall, all these factors together suggest he has a history of criminal behavior, is at an age where he's most vulnerable (19), lives with significant family stressors, and may be engaging in substance use. These combine to indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 8, in an urban area.\n"
