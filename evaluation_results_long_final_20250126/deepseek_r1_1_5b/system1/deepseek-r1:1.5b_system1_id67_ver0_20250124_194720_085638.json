    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this individual risk outpaces certain thresholds based on the given factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That seems neutral enough and doesn't indicate any specific risk factors that are commonly known or cause issues.\n\nHe has been arrested three times. While being arrested can have serious consequences, especially in certain communities, I don't think that alone is a high risk indicator. It's important to consider the broader context of his life, like where he's living and what communities there are associated with.\n\nHis conviction history doesn't seem particularly problematic on its own. Again, without more specific information about past crimes or their nature, it's hard to gauge if this person is at higher risk than others who have been similarly convicted.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 180 lbs. These are fairly common physical attributes for a person of his age. There\u2019s not much here that would necessarily raise concerns about his risk assessment.\n\nHis household size is three, he's rural, and he doesn't live alone. All these factors suggest he might be isolated or in a less densely populated area where risks can be higher due to lack of access to resources, security, etc.\n\nHe has never been married and isn\u2019t living alone now. Being single reduces the chances of being a target for domestic violence, which is a significant risk factor. That's something to consider but still not overwhelmingly high on its own.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma, which is below college, so he lacks higher education. This might affect his career prospects and opportunities in certain fields, but again, it doesn't directly indicate a high risk unless combined with other factors like lack of access to opportunities or financial stability.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been enrolled in college yet, so that\u2019s an important point because it means he might not be able to secure higher education opportunities. This could limit his career growth and increases the likelihood of being at higher risk for various issues associated with youth unemployment and potential criminal behavior due to low income or other factors.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn\u2019t experienced feelings of depression over the past month. While marijuana use can lead to mental health issues, this individual hasn't shown symptoms of depression yet, which doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s at higher risk immediately.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life or experiences. This seems more like a belief than an actual risk factor unless it's linked to past or present conditions that might increase vulnerability in specific areas, but I don't see how this would necessarily put him into a high-risk category without more information about his behavior or circumstances.\n\nPutting all these factors together: he\u2019s 22, has some criminal history, is from a rural area where living alone could be risky, never married suggests less domestic violence risk, and lacks higher education which might affect career prospects. While he hasn't used marijuana or shown depression, the other elements like being single and having limited education are more telling of potential risks.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think his risk does exceed some thresholds because of his living situation, lack of higher education, no marriage, and being a single individual without clear reasons to believe he\u2019s at higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
