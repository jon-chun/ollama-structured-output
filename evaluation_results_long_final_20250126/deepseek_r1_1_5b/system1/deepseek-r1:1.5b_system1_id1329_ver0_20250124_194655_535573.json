    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk based on my assessment. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 18, which is quite young for criminal justice. That might raise concerns because they could be in early-stage offenses. But since they're just 18, maybe that's acceptable unless there are specific risks associated with their maturity level.\n\nNext, he's an Hispanic male. I know Hispanic people can face different issues related to immigration and culture, but it doesn't inherently make them more or less likely to commit crimes compared to others from other racial backgrounds.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Two convictions for the same offense could be concerning because repeated offenses are a red flag. But without specific information about what that offense was, it's hard to assess the risk level.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. While body size can influence criminal behavior in some cases, especially with physical activity levels, this alone doesn't indicate a high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nWeight of 130 lbs seems light for an adult of his age and height. He could be a child, but since he's only 18, that's possible. However, the weight might also suggest a different body type or condition, which could be relevant in criminal behavior assessment.\n\nHe's not married, living alone is common, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't enrolled in college. These are all positive aspects regarding his ability to commit crimes. Without formal education, he might face more challenges, but it's also possible that he could have some skill development opportunities since he's older.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year and used drugs four years ago, with marijuana specifically affecting his mood for a while. This seems like a significant issue because substance use is a major risk factor in criminal behavior. However, the time frame where this happened isn't clear\u2014whether it was recent or long ago.\n\nAt 18, he's considered living with both biological parents in a household of size 9 and considering God's role. These aspects might influence his behavior but don't necessarily indicate a high risk unless there are specific risks tied to those factors.\n\nPutting it all together: He has convictions for an offense (two), is young, living alone, has substance use issues, and is from a Hispanic background. While some of these factors could increase the risk, especially with substance use, he's still a teenager, which might not be as high as someone in their late teens or early 20s.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 9, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
