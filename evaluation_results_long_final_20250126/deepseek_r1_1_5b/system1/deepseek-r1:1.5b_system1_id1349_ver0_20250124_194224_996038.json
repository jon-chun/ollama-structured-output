    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person's risk assessment should be high. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 18 and Black. Being Black can have some societal implications related to race, but as a criminal justice expert, the key here is about her actions, not her background. So that might be okay.\n\nShe has been arrested 10 times and convicted four times. That's pretty bad. With such high numbers, it definitely raises my alarm because being on the wrong side of the law can have serious consequences both legally and emotionally.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem like a direct indicator of risk here. They might be just measurements, but they could be accurate or misleading depending on where she is from. Still, given her arrest count, it's a red flag.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 109 lbs. That's about average for an adult male in the US, so maybe not problematic. But again, if she has been involved in multiple criminal acts, that's more concerning.\n\nHer age doesn't inherently make her a danger. Being 18 is young enough to have criminal history, but it's not automatically dangerous unless proven otherwise.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. That might affect her ability to support children or family members, but without additional evidence, I don't see how that connects to criminal risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not in college. That could be an indicator of lack of education, but criminal risk isn't about education level. It's more about behavior and history.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year and hasn't used drugs or been depressed. That's all pretty normal unless there are specific issues like substance abuse that might affect mental health, but it doesn't tie into criminal history.\n\nBeing raised by her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area \u2013 that could be related to family dynamics and support systems, which might influence legal outcomes. But again, unless there's evidence linking this to past crimes, it's not directly a risk factor.\n\nConsidering all these points: high number of arrests, lack of education, no substance abuse or depression, being raised in an urban area with her mother \u2013 everything is pointing towards this person having criminal history that shouldn't be overlooked. So I think the prediction should be yes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
