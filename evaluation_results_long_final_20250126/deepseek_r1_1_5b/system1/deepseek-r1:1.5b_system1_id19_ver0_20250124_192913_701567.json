    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for arrest and conviction. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nThe person is 20 years old, a male, White identity, arrested four times, convicted. That's already concerning because young offenders are more likely to get re-arrested or convicted. \n\nHe's 5'6\" and 135 lbs\u2014moderate weight for his age. Doesn't seem overly thin, which is good, but maybe not harmful.\n\nNot married yet; living alone in a small household of four. That's probably an indicator of low social support, but again, young people often have more support than adults.\n\nNo college degree, not in a 4-year program. He hasn't attended college, so he might have some gaps in education. This could lead to criminal behavior later on because higher educated individuals are generally less likely to commit crimes due to better opportunities and fewer factors contributing to crime.\n\nHe's a high school graduate but didn't attend college. That's a significant point\u2014missing a degree can increase the risk of getting caught, especially if he's been in prison for four years or more. He's not enrolled in 4-year programs either, so that might further contribute to his risk.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents in a small, urban household of size four. Urban living can be a risk because of exposure to crime and stress. That could make him vulnerable to re-arrestment. Also, he hasn't had any substance abuse problems in the past four years\u2014most people do\u2014but it might not directly affect his arrest rate.\n\nHe's considered that God has nothing to do with his situation. This is a big red flag because if someone believes they're under God's control or has no personal issues beyond their criminal history, it can lead to higher risk. That belief could make him more susceptible to being caught again and convicted.\n\nHis living alone in an urban area might expose him to more serious crimes compared to people who are living with others or have support systems. Being single in a small household can also lead to higher rates of crime-related issues, which would increase his chances of re-arresting.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents, which is common for many young offenders. However, he doesn't mention substance abuse past the four years\u2014maybe that's acceptable, but it's still something to consider if it's a significant issue. \n\nPutting all this together: arrests and convictions are high because of his age, lack of education, living alone, being single in a small household, possibly facing more serious crimes due to living alone in an urban area, and the belief that God controls him may increase re-arrest and conviction risk.\n\nSo, yes, these factors significantly indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
