    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk.\n\nFirst, the person is 22, which might indicate some potential for criminal behavior as they are younger. But it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe's a White male, but that doesn't inherently pose a higher risk level in terms of identity issues or cultural background.\n\nArrested once and not convicted yet. The length of time in custody is important because more time can lead to more serious issues like intent or intent to harm.\n\nThe individual isn't in college despite holding two jobs, which could affect his education or opportunities later on, but it's not a clear sign of criminal behavior.\n\nAge plays a role; younger individuals might engage in drug use earlier due to impulse control issues. However, this is speculative and not strongly correlated with criminal activity.\n\nHis marital status and living situation don't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there are hidden charges or issues related to his spouse.\n\nHe's 5'4\" and 140 lbs, which could suggest health risks but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal actions. However, body weight is a red flag for drug use.\n\nMarried individuals might have different patterns of behavior compared to single males, but this is not specific enough to assess risk.\n\nHis job history isn't provided beyond his jobs and education level, so I can't make any assumptions about skill or experience that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and is currently feeling down, which may indicate underlying issues related to substance use. However, this doesn't directly translate into high risk without more context.\n\nThe fact that he considered God nothing to do with his personal life adds a layer of speculation but doesn't provide concrete evidence of criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all these factors together, while there are signs of substance abuse and possibly younger age-related behaviors, they don't outweigh the lack of clear patterns or potential for criminal activity. Therefore, my assessment is NO.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
