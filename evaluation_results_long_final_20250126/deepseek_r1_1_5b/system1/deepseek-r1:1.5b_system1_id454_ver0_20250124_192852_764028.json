    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk for this person based on the provided factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they stack up against typical risk thresholds.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. At that age, she's starting to feel more vulnerable because of societal expectations around gender roles. She's arrested twice, which is not uncommon for young people, but I'm not sure if it's extremely high. Maybe average?\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, so education might be an issue, especially with the current social context. However, she's living alone, which could mean she might have less support at home, potentially affecting her ability to sustain herself.\n\nHer family size is five, including adults, which means there are more people around for support. She has lived with other adults in the past, but now alone might put pressure on her relationships. I'm not sure if that's a high risk or just part of her normal life.\n\nShe's never married and is living alone. That's interesting because being single often implies less support from family members. But she's considered by God to have something to do with what happens to her personally, which adds an extra layer. Maybe it contributes to more stable living due to divine guidance?\n\nHer height of 5'5\" and weight of 130 lbs are typical for a young adult; not necessarily high risk factors. She hasn't been married but is single now.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month, which seems positive. Maybe that indicates resilience or coping mechanisms, which could mitigate risks related to stress or emotional issues.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about her family structure with five people living together. That might mean more stressors from social interactions at home. Plus, she's raised by adults but has lived alone, which could lead to more isolation and potential stress on her personal life.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some factors that contribute positively or add layers of support (like being single and having a family with adults), the other aspects like family size, living alone, and the current social environment might indicate a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
