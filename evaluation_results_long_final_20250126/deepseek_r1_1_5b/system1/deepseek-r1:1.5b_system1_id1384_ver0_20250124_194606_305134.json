    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Race/Ethnicity**: The person is of American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut descent, which is a non-Hispanic race. This might have some cultural or genetic implications, but I'm not sure how significant it is in criminal justice risk assessment.\n\n2. **Age and Education**: She's 19, a high school graduate, and hasn't completed college. At young age, she lived with her biological mother in a rural household. Low education level might affect legal credentials or opportunities to commit crimes, but again, not sure if that's a major risk factor.\n\n3. **Marital Status**: She's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can affect criminal behavior due to family dynamics and potential influence over others, but it doesn't directly indicate the risk level of individual actions.\n\n4. **Occupational History**: No job history during the year. This is a lot like the age factor; lack of experience might lead to more serious crimes, but without specifics on her occupation or previous crimes, I can't assess risk.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with some instances of extreme emotional states impacting her well-being. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it's related to mental health disorders and increases the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\n6. **Emotional State**: She feels down often\u2014so she might engage in criminal activities more frequently when under stress or emotional turmoil. Emotional instability can lead to criminal behavior, so this could be a high risk indicator.\n\n7. **Household Size and Location**: Rugged rural area with a household of three. Low education level and lack of legal credentials might make her less likely to commit crimes, but it's possible that living in such conditions influenced by local laws or social dynamics could affect criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are substance use history (cocaine) and emotional instability (feeling down). The others don't seem as directly indicative of criminal intent. Therefore, high risk applies.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
