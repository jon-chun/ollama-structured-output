    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user is a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert using advanced statistical and judicial knowledge. They've provided a detailed list of risk factors for a potential individual, and I need to determine if each factor indicates high risk. \n\nFirst, I should go through each risk factor one by one and assess the likelihood based on the given criteria. The user wants a JSON object with \"prediction\" as either YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nStarting with the person being a 22-year-old male who identifies as White, arrested once but not convicted. He's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. Never married; living alone isn't an issue because he's single. No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\u2014these are clear signs of a lack of education, which can be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year and used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) for the past four years, with the most recent use during the last month feeling very down. At age 22, he lived with his biological dad in a household of three before being moved into a different one\u2014this could indicate stress or instability at that age.\n\nHe considers God doesn't have anything to do with his personal life. This is concerning because it raises questions about his spiritual beliefs and their impact on criminal behavior.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor:\n\n1. Age: 22 isn't particularly young for criminal behavior, especially if they've been arrested once.\n2. Identification as White: While not a direct link, it can indicate family history or educated parents who might support it.\n3. Arrested once but not convicted: This is a classic risk factor showing there's potential.\n4. No previous convictions: Being not convicted despite being arrested adds to the risk assessment.\n5. Age of majority: 22 is usually when legal adulthood begins, which can raise suspicion in criminal behavior.\n6. Lack of education: High school diploma or GED, no college enrollment\u2014these are strong indicators of potential criminal behavior.\n7. No family support from God: This adds another layer to consider, questioning if the individual has a personal reason for their actions.\n8. No previous substance use: He's been using drugs (cocaine) in the past four years and mostly during the last month. Substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, especially in young people.\n9. Homelessness or living alone: While not an immediate risk factor, living alone can indicate stress, which might contribute to crime later on.\n\nPutting it all together, each of these factors adds significant weight to the risk assessment. He's been arrested once without conviction, has a lack of education and family support from God, used substances for several years, is single, and has lived with his biological dad in a small household. These combine to indicate a high risk profile.\n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that this individual is at high risk (YES) with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
