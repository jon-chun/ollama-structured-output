    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess this person's risk based on the given factors. So, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 157 lbs. He's never married and isn't living alone, which might affect his family life in some areas. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. He has held four jobs over the past year. He used marijuana in the past four years, which I know is concerning. He hasn't felt depressed over the last month. At that age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 in a rural area. He also believes God plays a role personally.\n\nFirst, the arrest history: one time but not convicted. That's significant because many adults are never convicted, which can be a red flag. Since it's only one arrest, maybe that's less concerning than multiple convictions.\n\nHis age and race: White identity doesn't typically correlate with criminal behavior, but if he's from a particular community or neighborhood, there might be historical patterns against him. However, since the last arrest was 14 years ago, that seems quite long, so it's more of a recent issue rather than something common.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone: That suggests he's single and not in a household with others. Single parents sometimes face higher risk of domestic violence or substance abuse, depending on the situation.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED: This is a big red flag because it means he couldn't attend college, which can hinder education, employment, and access to criminal justice resources. The belief that God has something to do with his life might be overstated without more evidence.\n\nFour jobs over the year: It's possible he had multiple jobs, especially if one involved substance abuse or was part of a family situation. But this alone doesn't indicate high risk unless coupled with other issues like substance use or past convictions.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years: This is serious and can lead to addiction problems. Even though it wasn't convicted, it's an immediate risk factor that should be addressed.\n\nNo feelings of depression over the last month: While mental health issues are important, a single incident of feeling depressed might not be enough on its own unless there was ongoing stress or significant anxiety.\n\nHousehold size 4: In rural areas, especially, living with one parent can affect family dynamics. It's possible that he has a strained relationship with his biological mother, which could lead to domestic abuse issues if he gets pregnant or has children.\n\nGod's role as an influence in his life: While philosophical, it's not specific enough without more concrete evidence of how this belief affects his behavior or actions.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest once but not convicted raises questions. No college education makes him at risk for access to resources and justice opportunities. Using marijuana is a serious addiction and could be linked to criminal behavior. The lack of mental health issues is concerning, though not impossible. Living with one parent in a rural area might have some societal factors that affect his behavior. However, all these factors together suggest significant potential risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"75\"\n}",
