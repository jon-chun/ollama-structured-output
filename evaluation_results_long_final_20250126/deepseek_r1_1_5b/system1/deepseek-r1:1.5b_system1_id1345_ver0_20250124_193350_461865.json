    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 20 years old and a Black female. They've been arrested once but haven't been convicted. That's concerning because criminal records can indicate potential issues with family dynamics or personal experiences.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches, not too tall, which might have contributed to an arrest if there were height-related factors. She weighs 120 lbs\u2014average for her age and gender, so maybe the weight isn't the main issue here.\n\nNot married yet, living alone makes sense as a young adult. The family size is 4, which could be part of the issue if they had conflicts or unresolved family dynamics leading to an arrest.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and hasn't attended college, which might suggest she wasn't educated enough for criminal justice unless there were additional factors contributing to her arrest.\n\nShe's single, not engaged, which is less likely to cause a serious issue but could be part of the environment that led to an arrest. The lack of substance use over four years and some time feeling down in the dumps\u2014this seems like severe depression or emotional distress, especially when happening at such a young age.\n\nLiving with her biological father in an urban area might have contributed to family issues if they were strained. The belief that God influences personal experiences adds another layer that's often overlooked but can be relevant in serious cases.\n\nPutting it all together: She has multiple factors pointing towards potential emotional distress or family problems, which could indicate a high risk despite her age and legal convictions.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
