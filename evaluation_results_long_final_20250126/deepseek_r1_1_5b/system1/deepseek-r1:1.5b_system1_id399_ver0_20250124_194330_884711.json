    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate this risk assessment for a 19-year-old male. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old, which falls under the high school age limit. That might indicate potential issues related to education or mental health. But it could also be a sign of curiosity or interest in life, not necessarily problematic.\n\nHe identifies as White and has no race or gender specified. Since it's a young person, race isn't often a concern, but his background is important. He's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. His height might suggest he's active, which could be an issue if he's into sports or has other activities.\n\nHis current status as living alone without a partner shows isolation. This can affect mental health and relationships, so it should be considered a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted yet but has been arrested once before. conviction history can indicate past problematic behavior, which could lead to issues in the future.\n\nHis weight is within a healthy range, though that doesn't necessarily mean anything if he's not exercising enough or engaging in physical activities regularly.\n\nHe's never married and living alone suggests a lack of relationships, which could affect his mental health. This is a strong risk factor because poor family functioning can lead to stress and mental health issues.\n\nHe hasn't had any substance abuse but has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Medication use can be problematic if it interferes with daily life or causes significant emotional distress. Since he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, his depression status is low, which might not pose a risk factor for this point.\n\nHe's considered God to have something to do with his personal experiences. While that's interesting, unless there are specific signs of spiritual involvement or unanswered questions about his life events, it doesn't indicate a high risk.\n\nThe person has held one job during the year but no further information on work experience. If he had any past jobs, that could be an indicator of potential substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's been living in a household of size five for 5 years and doesn't specify if he's single or has children, which affects his mental health significantly. A larger family is more likely to lead to stress, depression, and poor relationships compared to a smaller household.\n\nHis drug use history (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years is concerning because these substances can be highly addictive and have significant effects on mental health. If he hasn't been feeling depressed in the last month, his depression status remains low, but the drug use itself is a clear risk factor for future issues.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED certificate, which might indicate limited education unless it's considered part of his background. This could be a sign of potential learning disabilities or lack of opportunities to develop critical thinking skills in the future.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college, so lack of formal education might be an indicator of potential problems with academic performance and mental health as he grows older.\n\nHis weight is within healthy limits but being overweight can sometimes indicate underlying issues like obesity-related health problems, which could affect mental health if they interfere with daily activities or relationships.\n\nOverall, several risk factors are present: age (high school limit), lack of education, living alone, potential for substance abuse, lack of relationships, low depression status, and possible lack of formal education. These all together suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
