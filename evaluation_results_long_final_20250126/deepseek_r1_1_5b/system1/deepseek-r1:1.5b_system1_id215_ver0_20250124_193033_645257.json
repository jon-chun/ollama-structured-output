    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. That's not inherently a bad sign because gender isn't typically linked to criminal behavior. But I should think about how that might affect her environment or experiences at school.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. Having ever been caught in a serious situation could be concerning, especially if there were prior convictions. But again, that's not necessarily high risk for criminal behavior itself, but it does mean she's already facing some kind of legal problem.\n\nShe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 130 lbs. That doesn't seem like an outlier or anything particularly concerning on a physical or developmental level. I don't think size would indicate higher risk in this context.\n\nShe never married, is currently not living alone, has worked three jobs during the year, holds a high school diploma without college, hasn't been enrolled in college, and has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years. Using drugs regularly can be concerning because it's a common problem that often leads to more serious issues later on, like addiction or mental health problems.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Feeling depressed could be a factor if there were other negative events affecting her mood, but she didn't mention any specific symptoms beyond depression. It might not be directly linked to criminal behavior unless combined with substance use.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size five. I don't think household size affects criminal risk at that stage. Maybe it's more about the community around them, but again, it doesn't indicate higher risk.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal life. This is interesting because some people believe in a connection between their faith and their behavior. But if she's struggling with substance use and mental health issues, her religious beliefs might not directly contribute to criminal risk unless there are other unexplained factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the prior convictions from arrests and the drug use. These could indicate a history of problem behavior that might lead to criminal activity or more serious issues like addiction. Additionally, using substances without medical help can have long-term consequences that affect one's ability to engage in further activities that contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these factors alone are enough to make her high risk, but they do present some concerning signs of substance abuse and potential past negative experiences leading up to criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"65\"\n}",
