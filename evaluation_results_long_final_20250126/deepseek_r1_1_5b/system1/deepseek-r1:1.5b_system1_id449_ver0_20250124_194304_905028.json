    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't sound like a high risk factor because it's pretty standard for young people regardless of their identity. \n\nNext, he's been arrested once but not convicted. This is concerning because if someone has been arrested without being convicted, they might be facing the death penalty. But I'm not sure how common this is among 20-year-olds. Maybe there are specific cases where this happens, so it could add to their risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 170 lbs. That seems about right for a young adult. Not too tall or short, which might be unusual but not necessarily bad in itself. \n\nHis age is 20, which isn't extremely high, but since he's still a minor, it doesn't add to the risk as much as adults do.\n\nHe hasn't been married and isn't living alone yet. This could indicate issues with relationships or social support, but again, not something that jumps out at me as a significant risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't in college, which might mean he's trying to build some skills without formal education. Not sure if that's bad or good for his future risks.\n\nHe's had two jobs during the past year, so he has experience in different areas, but again, not necessarily a high risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's used drugs four years ago (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Those drug uses might be concerning as they can indicate substance abuse, which could lead to serious issues like addiction or mental health problems. But is 20 too young for that? I'm not sure.\n\nHe's living in a household of size 4 with his biological mother and considers God doesn't affect him personally. This is about his relationship with his family, but it seems more personal than a risk factor for adult behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: He's young, arrested without conviction, has drug use history, not married yet, living in a moderate-sized household, no major health issues mentioned, and positive relationships. But none of the factors seem extremely concerning. \n\nI think he's not at high risk based on these factors because most 20-year-olds don't go through that. However, his drug history is definitely a red flag. It's possible he could be developing addiction or mental health issues later.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
