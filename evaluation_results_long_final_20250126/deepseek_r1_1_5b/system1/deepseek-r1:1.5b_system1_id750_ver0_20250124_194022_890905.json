    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and male, White. That seems normal. He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So that's a bit concerning because being arrested without conviction can raise serious concerns about his behavior or mental health.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and weighs over 250 lbs. That's a healthy weight for his height, so not high risk on that front.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone now. That's interesting. I don't know much about living alone as a 18-year-old, but it might indicate some stress or lack of support from others.\n\nHe's enrolled in school. That could mean he's trying to build his skills or prepare for college. But if he's already got an arrest without conviction and hasn't started school yet, that seems problematic.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. So he's not a full-time student but part-time? That might indicate some independence but also potential issues with work-life balance or mental health.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and doesn't feel depressed over the past month. That's concerning because marijuana use can be serious, and feeling depressed for just a month is worrying. It might suggest underlying issues that aren't being addressed.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 with his biological parents. That sounds familiar as a young person who's raised by their parents, maybe indicating some support structure or stress from family life.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal experiences. This ties into religious beliefs and how people interpret their circumstances. It could indicate deeper issues related to faith or spiritual influence.\n\nPutting all these together: he's arrested without conviction, which is a red flag. He's used substances and doesn't feel better in that month. Living in an urban area might stress him out. Having family support but considering God complicates things. He's already in school, so maybe he's not ready for the responsibilities of college or career.\n\nSo overall, these factors suggest there's a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
