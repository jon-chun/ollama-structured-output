    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a risk factor, but I should consider other aspects like substance use and mental health. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means there was an incident where he committed a crime, which could have led to legal issues. However, if the arrest resulted in conviction or trial failure, that might raise concerns about criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. While physical height isn't typically a risk factor on its own, it's part of his overall profile. His age being under 30 is also considered young, which sometimes can indicate potential issues with substance use or mental health, especially in a vulnerable population.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Being single at the time of the arrest could mean he was without support systems, increasing the risk of substance abuse or mood disorders. His family size being 3 (household) might have contributed to his isolation and lack of support, which could raise his profile as a risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. This level of education doesn't inherently indicate higher risk factors unless combined with substance use history or mental health issues, which aren't mentioned here. His employment status isn't clear, but having two jobs might mean he's employed full-time, possibly contributing to substance use if he's not managing it well.\n\nHe's usedcocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Cocaine use is a strong indicator of higher risk because it can lead to serious mental health issues like depression or anxiety. The lack of feelings of depression could be a concern, but it might not explain his substance use history.\n\nAt 20, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, which suggests he was raised by family members who may have had a different environment, potentially contributing to higher risk behaviors or mental health issues. His consideration of God having something to do with his life could be an interesting angle, but unless there's evidence that this belief affects substance use or mental health, it might not be the primary risk factor.\n\nOverall, while he has some concerning aspects like substance use and lack of support, especially in a vulnerable population at a young age, I don't see any factors that strongly point to high risk. However, the arrest history and potential legal implications do mean he's at least in a position where there could be significant consequences. But without concrete evidence linking these to higher-risk behaviors or conditions, it's more of an isolated incident than a clear indication of ongoing risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
