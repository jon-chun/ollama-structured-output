    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female, Hispanic. That's a red flag because Hispanic individuals are often more prone to delinquency and substance abuse. But wait, she hasn't been arrested yet. So the immediate risk isn't there.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and has convictions. But since she hasn't been charged yet, it doesn't put her at immediate risk. The potential for recidivism might still be a concern, but again, not immediate.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches, which is on the higher end for her age, but combined with her weight of 130 lbs and living alone, that seems like an outlier. Maybe she's in great shape, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with substance abuse risk factors.\n\nShe has no high school diploma or GED. That's a significant factor because having less education can lead to higher rates of substance use and delinquency. Without further education, she might be more likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nShe's not enrolled in college, which means she lacks the educational background needed for college-level studies. This could increase her risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior, but again, it doesn't put her at immediate danger yet.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. While job stability can sometimes lead to less risky behaviors, especially when considering financial management, it's still a factor that contributes to overall risk levels rather than high-risk behavior.\n\nHer drug history includes using marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using substances for delinquency is rare, but given her lack of education, this could be problematic. However, without immediate arrest, it's unclear if she's planning to commit a crime or just engage in risky behavior.\n\nLived with her biological mother in an urban household of size six. Urban living can lead to substance abuse and delinquency because people are exposed to more opportunities for these issues. But again, not necessarily high risk yet.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her situation. This might be a bit abstract but could indicate underlying stress or life choices that contribute to risky behaviors. However, it's a non-concrete factor and doesn't directly tie into the risks mentioned.\n\nOverall, while some of these factors, like family living in an urban area, lack education, and substance abuse history, she hasn't been arrested yet. It seems more about her lifestyle and choice of life rather than immediate criminal behavior. So I don't think she's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
