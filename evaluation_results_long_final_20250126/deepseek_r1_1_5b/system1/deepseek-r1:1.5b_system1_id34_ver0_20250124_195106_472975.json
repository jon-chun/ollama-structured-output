He's been arrested twice and convicted, which already indicates some serious issues. Being single and living alone might not add much, but the other factors could raise concerns.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 135 lbs, which are physically fit metrics, so that's positive. A high school diploma isn't bad, but since he's in a 2-year college now, maybe his education is a bit limited. He's enrolled, so he has some credits to work with.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs or felt depressed recently. That\u2019s good signs about mental health. Living in a small household of 5 might be manageable too. The idea that God influences his life could add an interesting angle, but it's not clear how significant that is in this context.\n\nPutting all these together: being arrested twice, his age group, living situation, education level\u2014all factors point towards high risk. He might be struggling academically or face some serious issues that could affect his future goals and well-being.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
