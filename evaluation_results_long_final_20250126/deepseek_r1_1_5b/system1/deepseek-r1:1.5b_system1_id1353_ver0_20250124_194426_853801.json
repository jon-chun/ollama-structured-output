    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to act as an expert in criminal justice risk assessment. They provided a detailed set of points about a person being a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. He's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs, never married, living alone now, has a GED but isn't in college, has held three jobs, used marijuana in the past four years, especially during the last month, and he's influenced by God. \n\nThe user wants me to create a JSON object with two keys: \"prediction\" and \"confidence.\" They specified that if the risk factors indicate high risk, it should be \"YES,\" otherwise \"NO,\" and provide a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each of these points against established criteria. The person is black, which might raise red flags given the race quotient in some jurisdictions. Being arrested three times without conviction could indicate past harmful behavior or substance abuse. He's young, lived with his biological mother in a small rural household, which might affect support networks and opportunities.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 170 lbs; while weight is neutral, height is on the lower side for males of his age, but again, it depends on the context and specific laws. The fact that he hasn't been convicted despite being arrested three times shows a pattern of behavior or substance use that could be dangerous.\n\nHis marital status as never married might impact family support and could lead to a lack of social safety net, though he's now living alone. Having only worked three jobs suggests limited job experience but doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless it's cumulative.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, especially last month, which is a significant substance use episode. That's a clear red flag for mental health issues and criminal behavior. The mention of feeling down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up further adds to anxiety about dealing with negative emotions resulting from addiction.\n\nHis biological mother living with him might have limited support and strained relationships, affecting his ability to seek help or live independently. Living alone now could make it harder for him to navigate social services and support networks without additional income.\n\nHe's influenced by God, which is a bit of a red herring because religious influence doesn't inherently correlate with criminal behavior unless there's evidence of abuse or addiction. However, it's worth noting that some people do use their faith for personal reasons outside legal systems.\n\nConsidering all these points\u2014arrest without conviction, substance use history, lack of support networks, living alone, and possible negative emotional impacts\u2014it does seem like he could be at a high risk. The confidence level should reflect the severity of these factors, especially the recent drug use episode which is a clear indicator of potential criminal behavior.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 85% because all these elements point to possible criminal activity beyond reasonable expectation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
