That seems concerning because criminal justice is strict, especially for marginalized communities.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 180 lbs. That's not an extremely high weight for his age, so maybe that's manageable.\n\nHe's single now and living alone. Single can be risky in many ways, but this person talks about feeling down a lot, which is tough because he's young. Maybe stress or other issues are affecting him.\n\nHe's enrolled in school right now. That's good to know, but if the previous arrest happened during his studies, it could complicate things.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. This might make the arrest more severe since the person identifies as Black, which is a sensitive issue. They feel like God affects him, which adds a layer of stress without knowing where he came from.\n\nThey've used marijuana in the past four years and have dealt with feeling down for over a month. The drug use can be serious, especially with mental health issues. Feelings of down are not just physical; they're emotional and psychological.\n\nThis person is young, which means he's vulnerable to stress, mental health issues, and social isolation, all of which can lead to criminal behavior. His lack of support system and the impact of past experiences on his current mental state make him a high risk individual.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",

He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
