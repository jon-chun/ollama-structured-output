    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male and white. That might be a sign of potential issues, but it could also indicate that he's coming from an educated background. Maybe his education has helped him in some way, which could impact his decision-making or behavior later on. But is that high risk? I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, he's been arrested once and convicted. That alone doesn't necessarily mean he's dangerous. People can make mistakes in the justice system, but a single offense doesn't always indicate a high risk. However, one offense might raise some red flags. Maybe he needs to be evaluated or have additional training.\n\nHe weighs 144 lbs and is 5 feet 8 inches tall. That seems normal for his age. His education has a GED certificate, so that's good; it means he could potentially go to college if needed. He's not enrolled in college, which might mean he's still working through the process of getting a degree or maybe he hasn't started yet.\n\nHe's lived alone and never married, but his household was size 4. That doesn't necessarily raise red flags either. Maybe that wasn't the most stable living situation when he got to be 19, which could affect his decision-making or ability to make responsible choices.\n\nHe's been holding a job for four different jobs during the past year and hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. That shows he's managing his drug use and hasn't had any problems with substance use related to his behavior. However, substance abuse can have severe effects on mental health, which could be a concern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression is serious, feeling low might not necessarily mean he's at high risk unless there are underlying issues like anxiety or other health problems that aren't addressed.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in an urban area where God has something to do with him. This could indicate a lot of spiritual growth and understanding from his parents. However, it doesn't directly translate into criminal behavior; more about how he views himself and the world around him.\n\nPutting all these together: He's coming from an educated family, has one serious offense, but otherwise seems well-behaved. Unless there are specific signs like substance abuse or mental health issues that indicate a higher risk, it might not be high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
