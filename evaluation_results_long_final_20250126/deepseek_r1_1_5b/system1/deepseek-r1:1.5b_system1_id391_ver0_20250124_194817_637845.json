    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as concerning, especially since his age isn't that high and he hasn't been arrested yet. But I should keep in mind that at 19, someone might be more susceptible to certain issues.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, so there's a criminal record. That's definitely a red flag for risk assessment. Convictions can indicate underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and he weighs 160 lbs. While that might suggest a sedentary lifestyle, it doesn't seem extreme on its own. However, combined with other factors, it's still something to consider for risk assessment.\n\nHe's not married and lives alone, which could be an indicator of substance abuse or substance dependency. But I should also remember that living alone can sometimes lead to neglect, but he hasn't mentioned anything about that yet. His family background is rural, which might influence his behavior, especially if it's related to domestic issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so he has some college education but not at the level of a typical 19-year-old. This could mean he's less likely to engage in higher-level substance use or other risky behaviors without proper support.\n\nHe hasn't been employed during the past year, which might suggest he's not contributing to the household income, possibly leading to neglect. But again, it's more about behavior than income from that aspect.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years but mostly never in the last month. That could indicate a history of substance use or drug use. He also mentions feeling down in the dumps for most of the past month, which seems like intense feelings of despair and nothing uplifting to cheer him up. This emotional state, combined with his lack of support system (lived alone), makes me question if he's at high risk.\n\nHis family is rural, so living alone might mean more neglect without support. If someone has substance abuse issues or mental health problems, living alone can be particularly challenging and lead to higher risk behaviors. His history with substance use could contribute to that risk.\n\nPutting it all together, his criminal record, lack of education level beyond high school, lived alone in a rural area, substance abuse history, emotional down moments, and possible neglect make him at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
