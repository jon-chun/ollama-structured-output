    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 22, a male, white. That's not immediately alarming, but maybe in terms of race or cultural background. He's been arrested six times and convicted, which is pretty serious. But are those convictions just for a minor offense? Maybe, so that could be a point to consider.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 154 lbs. That doesn't seem too tall or overweight for his age. His family isn't big\u20145 people in the household and living alone now. I wonder if being single is a risk factor. Single parents might face different societal pressures, but it's not something immediately alarming.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That could be a concern because many of these risks are more common when you don't have a formal education. Plus, he's been using drugs for the past four years, mostly marijuana, especially during the last month. Drug use is a major risk factor\u2014more than 80% of arrests are often drug-related.\n\nHe's also had some issues with his mental health. Feeling down and depressed frequently can lead to anxiety and depression, which could increase the risk of substance abuse or other negative outcomes. But how does that tie into being at high risk? It might not be a direct cause but could contribute by affecting judgment or behavior related to substances.\n\nHe's raised his kids in an urban household with five people. Urban living can have social isolation and stress, which are sometimes linked to substance abuse since it's a risky behavior for many. That family size might also add some stress factors, though I'm not sure if that's a primary risk factor on its own.\n\nOverall, the person has significant convictions, is arrested six times, and uses drugs, which are strong indicators of a higher risk. The other details like his age, height, mental health issues, family life, etc., might contribute but aren't enough to outweigh the significant convictions. So, I think he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
