While he has a history of arrests, none of them have led to convictions, suggesting less involvement in criminal activities. He is not currently under any legal supervision and does not exhibit signs of ongoing criminal behavior. His lack of education and employment might suggest potential vulnerabilities, but these factors do not necessarily correlate with high risk. The individual's religious beliefs are generally associated with positive outcomes rather than increased risk. Living alone could indicate a higher risk for certain scenarios, such as suicide or self-harm, but without additional information, this cannot be definitively confirmed. Overall, while there are potential risks, they appear to be mitigated by his personal circumstances and current lifestyle.",
