His age at first living arrangement with both parents suggests he may have grown up in an environment conducive to family stability. He is currently alone and living independently, which could indicate a lack of strong support systems. The individual's educational attainment (high school diploma) and college enrollment suggest he has the capacity for learning and growth. His employment history may reflect stable income or work habits. However, his confidence level in considering God's role in personal affairs might be a potential risk factor related to religious beliefs. With a medium-level prediction and 75% confidence, this individual presents both high and moderate risk factors that need careful monitoring.",
