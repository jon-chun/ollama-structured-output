His youthful living arrangement with his biological mother in an urban area suggests a stable upbringing. He is enrolled in school and has no history of drug use, which are positive factors. However, his recent feelings of depression indicate potential psychological risk. The presence of God in his life could be seen as a positive influence but might not directly impact criminal behavior. Overall, while there are mitigating circumstances that reduce the perceived high-risk profile, the individual's current state and past feelings suggest some level of risk remains.",
