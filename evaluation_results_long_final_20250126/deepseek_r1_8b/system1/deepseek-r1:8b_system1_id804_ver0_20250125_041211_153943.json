    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this risk assessment. So, I'm supposed to analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. The person is a 22-year-old female with some specific background.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested seven times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior can predict future involvement in the justice system. Even though she hasn't used drugs in four years, her past arrests suggest she might have engagement in illegal activities before that.\n\nShe's mixed race and living alone after a divorce. Divorce could lead to stress or instability, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors. Being alone might mean there's no one monitoring her actions, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHer education level is a GED, and she's not in college. Having only held two jobs during the year might indicate underemployment or economic struggles, both of which are linked to higher crime rates.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs recently, but her emotional state is down a lot, feeling hopeless. Emotional distress can be a precursor to criminal behavior as people may commit crimes to cope with their feelings.\n\nShe considers God involved in her personal life, which might mean she has a strong moral code or support system through religious beliefs, possibly helping her avoid crime. But it could also be that she's using religion as a coping mechanism, which might not be enough on its own.\n\nAt a young age, living with her mother in a household of three could indicate challenging family dynamics. Growing up in a larger family might have exposed her to different influences, some positive and some negative.\n\nPutting all this together: criminal history is a strong indicator. She's shown she can engage in illegal activities before. Her current emotional state is concerning, and while she has some positive factors like employment and potentially religious beliefs, the combination of past behavior, current distress, and potential lack of support could increase risk.\n\nI'm not sure if her being mixed race significantly affects the assessment here unless there's systemic issues involved, which aren't detailed. So, considering all these points, it seems likely she poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
