    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors case and determine if it indicates a high risk based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's look at the individual: an 18-year-old male who is mixed race. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's a point in the negative since criminal history shows he's been involved before. His physical build is tall (6'11\") and heavy (230 lbs), which might be relevant but I'm not sure how much that affects risk.\n\nHe hasn't married yet, lives alone, so maybe some isolation factors. No high school diploma or GED, and isn't in college. Unemployment for the year adds to possible economic stressors. In the past four years, he's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine. That's a significant factor as drug use is linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate he's managing his mental state or there's no current indication of instability from that angle. At a young age, living in a household of six could mean exposure to more stressors or chaotic environments growing up.\n\nHis lack of religious belief (doesn't think God affects him personally) might contribute to a different set of values or social connections, which could be a risk factor if it implies isolation or lack of support networks.\n\nPutting this together: He has criminal history, uses drugs, is unemployed, lacks education, and possibly lacks strong social support. These are all high-risk indicators on their own, especially the drug use and criminal record, which often correlate with higher recidivism rates. The lack of education and employment could lead to economic instability, increasing risk of further issues.\n\nThe fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently doesn't negate his past substance abuse or criminal history. His living situation as a child was large, but it's unclear if that had a negative impact on him.\n\nSo, considering all these factors together, the risk is likely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
