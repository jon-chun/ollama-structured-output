    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female identifying as Black. That demographic can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors, especially in urban areas where there might be more crime rates.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. This could indicate some criminal behavior or tendencies, but without a conviction, it's not definitive. It shows she's had interactions with the law, which is a red flag.\n\nHer physical description: 5'4\" and 105 lbs. Not sure how much that contributes, but maybe being smaller might make her more vulnerable in certain situations, though I don't have specific data on that.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 can be risky, especially if she's dealing with other issues like emotional distress. It might lead to social isolation or making poor decisions without someone to rely on.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor as it suggests she's engaged in constructive activities. However, being enrolled doesn't necessarily mean she's stable in all areas of her life.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which shows responsibility and earnings, another positive sign. Employment can provide stability and reduce risks associated with not having income or structure.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but has felt down lately. The lack of recent drug use is good, but feeling down could indicate emotional instability or stressors that might lead to risky behaviors, like criminal activity or self-harm.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her mother in a large household in an urban area. Growing up in a big family in an urban environment might expose her to different challenges, such as higher crime rates or exposure to negative influences.\n\nShe believes in God and personal outcomes, which might give her a sense of purpose or structure, potentially reducing some risks if she relies on faith for guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: She's had legal issues, lives alone, is emotionally stressed, comes from a possibly challenging background, and has some positive factors like school and work. The lack of recent drug use is a plus, but her current emotional state could be a risk factor. Her past arrests without convictions might indicate higher risk.\n\nHer confidence in God might help her cope, but the other risk factors are present. Considering all this, she might pose a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
