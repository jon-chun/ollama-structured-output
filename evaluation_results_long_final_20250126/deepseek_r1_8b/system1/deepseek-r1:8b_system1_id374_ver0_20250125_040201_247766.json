Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. That might lower the immediate risk since she hasn't had a conviction yet. Next, her physical stats\u20145'5\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is, but sometimes appearance can be a factor in certain crimes.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors because there's less oversight or accountability. She has a Bachelor's degree and is in grad school, which shows she's motivated and perhaps has higher education, which might reduce some risks.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Stable employment usually indicates lower risk factors as it suggests a structured life. However, she admitted to using marijuana in the past four years, which is concerning, but not necessarily a high risk unless there's more context about frequency or recent use.\n\nIn the past month, she felt down and nothing could cheer her up. That's a red flag for potential mental health issues, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors like substance abuse or criminal activity. Additionally, she considers God involved in her personal life. That might indicate a strong belief system, which could either provide support or lead to actions based on religious values.\n\nConsidering all these factors: no prior convictions, stable work, higher education, but some signs of possible mental health issues and substance use. The lack of criminal history is a plus, but the recent emotional struggles and past drug use might increase risk moderately. Without more severe indicators like a history of violence or more serious criminal behavior, I'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk, so YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
