    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Her race and gender might be relevant in different contexts, but without specific data on how these factors contribute to criminal risk, I can't rely solely on that.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests don't always lead to convictions, so this could mean she's more likely to engage in criminal behavior if certain other factors are present. The lack of a conviction might indicate she hasn't been as heavily punished before, which could be a motivator for further actions.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5 feet 2 inches and 160 lbs. Body type doesn't directly correlate with risk, so I'll set that aside.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes increase the likelihood of certain behaviors if there are no accountability mechanisms, but without more context on her social support systems, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can influence job opportunities and socioeconomic status, which might affect criminal tendencies. Being enrolled in college could indicate she's striving for something positive, possibly reducing risk factors, but if she's using drugs now, that complicates things.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use is more concerning than past usage, especially considering her current mental state. The fact that most of the past month she felt down on everything could indicate she's experiencing stress or depression.\n\nShe feels \"so down in the dumps\" recently, which suggests she might be dealing with emotional difficulties. Depression can sometimes lead to coping mechanisms like substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nHer upbringing: She grew up with both biological parents in a rural household of four. While a stable family background is generally positive, I don't see specific red flags here unless the family has a history of criminal behavior or she's using this stability to engage in risky activities.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God and considers God irrelevant to her personal life. This lack of spiritual belief might affect her sense of purpose or moral framework, potentially increasing risk if she lacks a religious or philosophical basis for making good choices.\n\nPutting it all together: Arrest history without conviction indicates some engagement with the legal system but hasn't been punitive yet. Current drug use and feelings of depression could be significant risk factors. Her educational status might be a protective factor, but her recent emotional state is more concerning.\n\nGiven that she's using drugs recently and feels down, this combination raises the risk. However, without more information on past behavior or specific crimes, it's hard to determine if this is high risk. Maybe I should consider that this person could be at moderate risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
