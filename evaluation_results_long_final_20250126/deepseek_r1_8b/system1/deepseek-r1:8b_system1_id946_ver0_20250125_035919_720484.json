    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this set of risk factors for a 22-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and 5'5\", 214 lbs. Not sure how much that contributes, but BMI might be a consideration. She has a GED and isn't enrolled in college, which could mean she lacks education for better job prospects or opportunities. She hasn't held any jobs this year, which is concerning for employment stability.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted, indicating some history of legal issues. She lives alone and is separated, so maybe there's an instability factor. She has a GED but no college enrollment, which might limit her options.\n\nHer weight at 214 lbs is above average, but not sure if that's relevant here unless it relates to health or other factors. She hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but she felt down \"so down in the dumps\" recently, so there might be some mental health issues.\n\nShe was raised in a large household with non-biological parents. That's a significant risk factor as studies show growing up in unstable or abusive households can increase criminal tendencies or other risky behaviors.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal outcomes could relate to her mindset and potential involvement in activities tied to religious or spiritual groups, which might have risks associated.\n\nPutting it all together: past legal issues, lack of education, no job history, possible mental health concerns, and a chaotic upbringing. These factors collectively point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
