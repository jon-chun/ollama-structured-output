    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. That's a demographic factor that might contribute to higher risk in some contexts, but it alone isn't determinative. I need to look at other factors too.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Two arrests mean he's had interactions with the criminal justice system before. A conviction could indicate past behavior that might repeat. That's a significant factor leaning towards high risk.\n\nHe weighs 140 lbs., which is on the lower side but not necessarily indicative of anything unless combined with other factors. Not sure how much this affects risk, maybe less so than others.\n\nNever married and living alone. Some people who live alone can be at higher risk for certain behaviors because they might have more access or time to engage in risky activities. That could add to the risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known predictor of higher criminal activity, as it can limit employment opportunities and lead to socioeconomic struggles. This is a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHe's held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to financial stress or boredom. This is another point that suggests higher risk.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use, especially at a younger age, is a significant factor linked to higher recidivism rates. He's used marijuana recently, which could indicate ongoing substance issues.\n\nHas not felt depressed over the past month. While depression can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior (as some studies suggest), feeling not depressed doesn't necessarily mean there's no risk. However, his lack of depression might not counterbalance other high-risk factors like past arrests and unemployment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a larger family in an urban environment can sometimes lead to higher exposure to criminal influences or stressors, which might contribute to delinquent behavior. That's another factor that could increase risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. A lack of religious beliefs might be associated with higher risk behaviors as it can remove a potential influence towards prosocial behavior.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests, a conviction, unemployment, no education beyond high school, current substance use, living alone, and a secular worldview all point towards a high risk. The combination is strong enough to suggest that this individual might engage in criminal activities again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
