    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point carefully.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male, which is relatively young and might be more impulsive or less experienced in making decisions. Younger age can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe identifies as White, so that's his racial identity, but I don't think race directly affects risk here unless there are specific societal factors related to ethnicity, which isn't mentioned.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted, which suggests he has a history of illegal activity. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk because they show past behavior that could lead to future issues.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 140 lbs. While not directly a risk factor, being underweight or of average build might relate to substance use or health factors, but it's minor here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if there's no one monitoring behavior or providing support. However, many people live independently without issues.\n\nHe is enrolled in school currently, which is positive because it suggests he's engaged in an institutional structure that could provide support and reduce risk factors like unemployment or idleness.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year, which is concerning. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it may lead to financial stress or boredom, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent substance use is a significant risk factor because it indicates active involvement with substances that can contribute to criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate he's currently functioning well mentally. However, previous depression or issues could be relevant, but since it's not mentioned, I don't know.\n\nAt 18, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a larger family with both parents might provide some stability, but being in an urban environment can expose him to higher crime rates and more opportunities for delinquent behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. This could indicate he's part of a community or group that may influence his decisions, possibly towards more conforming or rule-following behavior, or perhaps towards more religiously motivated actions that might be criminal if extreme.\n\nPutting it all together: Arrests and convictions are strong indicators. Unemployment can add to risk. Drug use is another major factor. Being young and living in an urban area with a stable family background. The religious belief might mitigate some risks but isn't as significant as the other factors.\n\nSo, considering all these points, especially the arrest history, substance use, and unemployment, I think it's likely that this person poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
