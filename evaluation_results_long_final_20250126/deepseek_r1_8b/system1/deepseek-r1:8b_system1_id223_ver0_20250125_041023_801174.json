    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this person's risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's straightforward. Age might play a role in risk assessment, but it alone isn't determinative.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest could be a red flag, but without a conviction, it doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk. People can be arrested without being found guilty or having charges dropped.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 160 lbs. That's within the average range, so I don't think physical build contributes much to risk factors here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Being single might affect social ties, which could relate to risk, but again, it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe holds a high school diploma and is in college. Education level can be a protective factor as it indicates he's striving for more, which might reduce some risks associated with criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. Employment stability is generally seen as positive, indicating responsibility and structure, which could lower risk.\n\nHe used drugs (cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is concerning, but the lack of current depression might indicate he's managing it or not experiencing the usual triggers that could lead to further issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can have various social and economic challenges, which might increase risk factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to risk environments.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity could be a protective factor as it provides a sense of purpose and structure, potentially reducing criminal involvement.\n\nPutting this all together: He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a concern. Past drug use is another point. Growing up in an urban single-parent household might have exposed him to more risk factors. However, his current employment, education, and religious beliefs are positive indicators that could mitigate some risks.\n\nI should also consider other possible factors like family support, economic stability, and social ties. Since he's enrolled in college and holding jobs, he might have stronger supports that reduce risk. Additionally, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently despite past drug use suggests he might be managing his mental health better now.\n\nThe arrest without a conviction is the most concerning factor here. It indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, which can sometimes be a precursor to higher risk behavior or further legal issues in the future. However, without more information on the nature of the arrest (like whether it was for a minor offense or something more serious), it's hard to assess the severity.\n\nIn risk assessment models, prior arrests, especially if unchargeable or with dropped charges, might not significantly increase overall risk unless accompanied by other factors like a history of violence or repeated offenses. Since there\u2019s only one arrest and no convictions, it's a moderate concern but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nThe combination of factors leans towards a moderate risk, but given the mitigating circumstances like education, employment, and current mental health, I might lean towards a lower confidence in assessing a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
