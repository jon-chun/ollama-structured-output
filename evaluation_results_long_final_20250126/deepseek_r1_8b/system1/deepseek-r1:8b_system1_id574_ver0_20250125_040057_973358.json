    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, White, and hasn't been convicted but was arrested once. That arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction in terms of criminal history. But still, any arrest can be a red flag.\n\nShe has no jobs this year and is enrolled in college. That suggests she's either focusing on education or perhaps facing some economic challenges. Not having a job could indicate financial instability, which might be related to other risks like theft or drug-related offenses.\n\nHer past drug use includes marijuana and cocaine within the last four years. This is concerning because substance abuse can lead to further criminal activity or arrests. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so maybe her mental state isn't as fragile as it could be.\n\nShe's living alone now but grew up in an urban area with her biological mother. Living with a single parent in an urban environment might expose her to different risks compared to someone from a more stable family background or a rural setting.\n\nHer religious beliefs about God influencing her personal life might indicate she has a support system or moral framework that could influence her decisions. It's unclear how this would directly impact risk, though.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, drug use, no job or income stability, and some aspects of her background that might contribute to higher risk behaviors. However, without a conviction, her immediate risk is lower. She's also enrolled in college, which could indicate she's working towards a better future, reducing some risks.\n\nI'm on the fence because there are signs of potential risk factors but no concrete evidence of current or high-risk behavior beyond past drug use and an arrest that didn't result in a conviction. Without more information about her recent behavior or whether she's seeking help for substance abuse, it's hard to assess higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
