    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall assessment.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Being a young adult could be a factor, but I'm not sure how much that alone contributes to higher risk without more context. Age can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested seven times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and convictions, which usually points towards higher risk. People with multiple run-ins are more likely to reoffend, so this is a strong indicator.\n\nHer physical description is 5'5\" and 120 lbs. Not sure how relevant weight or height is here unless it relates to other factors, but in this case, probably not directly related to criminal risk beyond what her arrest history suggests.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, as there might be less oversight or support systems in place. However, without more information on her social supports or environment, it's hard to weigh this factor heavily.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant predictor of future criminal behavior, especially if she has previous arrests related to substance abuse or other issues that could be linked to socioeconomic factors.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity due to financial stressors or lack of structure in her life. This is another factor pointing towards higher risk.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Recent drug use, especially chronic use like using in the past month, is a strong indicator of higher risk for further criminal behavior. Drug use often correlates with other high-risk activities.\n\nShe feels down and hopeless, unable to be cheered up during the past month. This depression or emotional distress can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including criminal ones, as a way to cope or escape.\n\nShe comes from a background where she lived with both parents in a rural area at a young age. Rural backgrounds can sometimes have different rates of crime, though it's not clear if that's relevant here. However, her family situation might influence her current behavior, especially if there were issues in the household.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with her life personally. This lack of spiritual belief could impact her coping mechanisms and social supports, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/criminal history, current drug use, unemployment, lack of education, living alone, emotional distress, and a background that might not provide strong support. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
