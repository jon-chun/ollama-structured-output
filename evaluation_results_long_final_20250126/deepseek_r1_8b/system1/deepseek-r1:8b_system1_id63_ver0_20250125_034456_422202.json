    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Being young and possibly facing some life challenges could be a factor. She hasn't been convicted but has been arrested once. That arrest history might indicate some prior issues, though not necessarily severe.\n\nHer physical description is 5'2\" and between 100-124 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is, but maybe in terms of health or ability to commit certain crimes? Not a big factor here.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone. She has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which could point to educational deficiencies that might be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year, which suggests she might be unemployed, possibly increasing her vulnerability or stress levels. That's another point towards potential risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but was feeling down and hopeless in the past month. Depression could lead to higher risk behaviors, either through poor decisions or increased likelihood of criminal activity as a coping mechanism.\n\nHer upbringing was in a large household with both biological parents in an urban area. That might mean she had some support, but it's also possible that there were stressors from living in an urban environment, which can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nShe believes God plays a role in her personal outcomes, which could indicate religious beliefs that might influence her behavior or decision-making in certain ways.\n\nPutting this all together: she has an arrest record without a conviction, educational issues, unemployment, possible mental health struggles, and a supportive but possibly stressful upbringing. These factors can contribute to higher risk behaviors, including criminal activity. The lack of a job and education can limit opportunities, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nI think her age might work in her favor as she's still young and could have more opportunities ahead, but considering the other factors, it seems like there are several red flags that could indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 9, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
