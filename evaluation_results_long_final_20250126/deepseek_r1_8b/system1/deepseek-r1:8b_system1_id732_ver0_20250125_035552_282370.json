    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute to or detract from the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. His age is relatively young, which could be a factor in criminal behavior, though it's hard to say on its own. Being male is often associated with higher rates of certain crimes, but again, it's just one factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests he has some history of illegal activity. This is a significant indicator because prior arrests can predict future ones. The fact that he was convicted means there's a recent criminal record, which increases risk.\n\nHis physical build: 6 feet 0 inches and over 250 lbs. While being larger might sometimes be associated with higher risk in physical confrontations or thefts, it's not a direct indicator of overall criminality without other factors.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor as it might lead to more opportunities for criminal behavior or isolation. However, many people live alone without issues, so this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher rates of crime because it limits job prospects and can lead to economic hardship, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial stress, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activities as a means of coping or due to desperation.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't inherently a crime, but it's a significant risk factor because it can lead to further criminal behavior or involvement with the justice system. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest some stability in that area.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. Growing up in a large family could have both protective and risk factors. It might provide more supervision or it could be chaotic, contributing to delinquent behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his personal outcomes, which is an atheist stance. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior because it instills values and norms that discourage crime. Without that, there might be less inhibition.\n\nPutting all this together: he has a prior conviction, uses drugs, lacks education and stable employment, and doesn't have a strong belief system that might deter him. These factors are concerning and point towards higher risk. The lack of depression in the past month is a bit confusing but could mean he's managing stress effectively or that his situation hasn't recently worsened.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think there's a moderate to high risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
