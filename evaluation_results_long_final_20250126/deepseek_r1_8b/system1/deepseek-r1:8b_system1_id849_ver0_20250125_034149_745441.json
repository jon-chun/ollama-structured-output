Let me go through each point carefully.\n\nFirst, she's White and hasn't been convicted, but she was arrested once. That's a minor arrest record, so that's not too concerning on its own. \n\nShe's 5'6\" and 160 lbs. Not particularly tall or overweight, which doesn't immediately raise any red flags related to physical risk factors.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone now. Single living can sometimes be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, but it's not definitive without more context.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, holding two jobs this year. Stable employment suggests she's responsible and maybe less likely to engage in risky activities, which could lower the risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. However, she mentioned feeling \"so down\" during some months, indicating possible mental health issues or stress. This could be a risk factor if it's not addressed.\n\nReligious beliefs tied to God might influence her coping mechanisms, potentially leading her to rely on faith instead of other methods when stressed.\n\nShe lived with both parents in a rural area as a child. Rural backgrounds can sometimes correlate with different social dynamics, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nPutting this all together: She has no criminal history beyond an arrest, is employed, doesn't use drugs, and has some emotional struggles. Without significant prior issues or high-risk behaviors, her risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
