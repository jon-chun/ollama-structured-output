    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high-risk individual based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's straightforward demographic info. Now, his criminal history: two arrests and one conviction. Wait, so he was arrested twice but only has one conviction? That might indicate that he's been in trouble before but maybe not always convicted. So, the fact that he's been arrested shows some involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 170 lbs. Not sure how physical build plays into risk factors, but sometimes it can be a factor in assessments. He's never married and lives alone now. Living alone at 19 could mean he doesn't have a stable social support system, which might increase certain risks.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Holding two jobs in the year suggests he's working, maybe providing some stability, but not being in college might indicate he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk factor depending on the context.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Recent use of marijuana within four years is relevant because current substance use can correlate with higher risk behaviors or recidivism. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so his mental health seems stable at the moment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a larger family in an urban environment might expose him to different stressors or influences compared to living alone now. The fact that he considers God has nothing to do with his personal happenings suggests he might have a non-religious worldview, which could be a protective factor or not, depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history indicates some involvement, current substance use, and living alone without a stable family support system. These factors can contribute to higher risk in assessments, especially if there's concern about recidivism or other high-risk behaviors. However, since he's been arrested but only convicted once, maybe the threat isn't extremely high. Also, no recent depression could lower some risks.\n\nI think I need to weigh these factors. Criminal history is a strong indicator, and current substance use adds to that. Living alone might increase risk of certain outcomes, like higher risk behaviors or lack of supervision. However, since he's holding jobs, maybe there's some stability. But considering all, it's likely he does pose a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
