    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if the person is at high risk based on criminal justice criteria. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Gender and race can be demographic factors but might not directly correlate with criminal risk. However, being male is sometimes associated with higher risk due to gendered criminology.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted, which suggests he's had interactions with the justice system before. Prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk because they indicate a history of illegal behavior.\n\nHis physical build: 6 feet 0 inches and 180 lbs. While physical stature can vary widely, there's no specific indicator here that directly relates to criminal risk. Sometimes, factors like obesity or height can be correlated with certain types of crimes, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might not inherently pose a risk, though it could relate to social support or supervision. Being single doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education may be linked to higher risk. Not being in college might indicate limited opportunities, which can contribute to delinquent behaviors.\n\nHe's held seven jobs in the year. Employment history is positive because it suggests he has some stability or structure, which can deter criminal behavior. More job stability often correlates with lower risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator of future criminality, but frequent use, especially recent use (some months), could increase risk. The fact that he's used them recently might suggest higher likelihood of continued or more severe behavior.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, unable to be cheered up. Depression or emotional distress can lead to coping mechanisms like substance abuse or criminal behavior as a way to escape problems. This is a significant factor because mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household might provide more supervision and guidance, but urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. However, his current living situation is alone, which might not directly relate.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life personally. Religion can play a role in behavior, so lack of belief might mean he lacks a moral framework or support system that religion provides.\n\nPutting it all together: three arrests, current drug use, recent emotional distress, and lower education. These factors are all positive indicators of higher risk. His job history is positive but the other negative factors outweigh it. The combination suggests he's more likely to engage in criminal behavior again.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
