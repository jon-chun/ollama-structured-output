    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but alone, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate higher risk because they show criminal behavior, even if it didn't result in a conviction. But since he hasn't been convicted, maybe his situation isn't as severe.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and 160 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything related to risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe's never married and is not living alone. Living with others might mean more social support or supervision, which could lower risk, but I'm not sure how much weight that should have.\n\nHe completed an associate/junior college education and isn't enrolled in college now. Education level can be a factor; higher education sometimes correlates with lower criminal activity, but again, it's context-dependent.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year, which is positive as employment can indicate stability. More stable individuals might have less reason to engage in criminal activities.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It indicates possible involvement in the criminal justice system, although he hasn't been convicted yet. However, the fact that he's using drugs could mean higher risk of future offenses or more severe charges if something happens.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can influence risk; being asymptomatic might lower some concerns, but I don't know enough about his history to say for sure.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Growing up in a larger family could provide more support or potentially lead to different social dynamics, which might affect behavior. It's a bit ambiguous how this would influence risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal outcomes. A lack of religious beliefs might not directly relate unless it's part of a broader context that influences decision-making, but I'm not sure.\n\nPutting all this together: He has an arrest history, uses drugs, and is young. These are red flags. The fact that he hasn't been convicted doesn't negate the risk posed by his current behavior. His employment suggests some stability, which might mitigate some risks, but drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk.\n\nI think these factors do indicate high risk, so I'll lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence around 65 because there are some positive indicators but also significant negative ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
