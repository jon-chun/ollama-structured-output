    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. I don't know if age or ethnicity directly contribute to criminal risk, but sometimes younger people might be more impulsive. Being Hispanic doesn't inherently pose a higher risk either.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant factor. A history of arrests and convictions suggests he's had problems with the law before, which could mean higher risk for recidivism.\n\nHis physical stats: 5'7\" and 190 lbs. Not sure how that relates to risk factors beyond maybe health issues, but not directly about criminal behavior.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, though I've heard that some criminals manage their lives while committing crimes as well. It's a neutral factor in terms of risk assessment.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED might indicate he's not pursuing further education, which could relate to lower socioeconomic status, possibly linked to higher criminal activity, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Employment can be a positive indicator, suggesting he has some stability, which might reduce risk. But if he lost his job or had issues at work, that could contribute differently.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use is definitely a red flag for higher risk. The recent feelings of being down (depressed) might indicate stress or instability, which can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of 4. A large family size can sometimes mean more supervision or support, but it's unclear if that's positive or negative here. It might relate more to his upbringing rather than current risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. That could indicate a strong religious faith, which is often associated with lower criminal activity due to moral beliefs, though I'm not sure how impactful this is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: past criminal history is a major factor pointing towards higher risk. His drug use and recent emotional issues also contribute. Employment might be a positive sign, but his history of arrests and substance abuse outweigh that. The rest of the factors don't negate these significant concerns. So, I'd say he has a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
