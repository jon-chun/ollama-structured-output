    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person indicates a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male, which is relatively young and might be more impulsive or have less experience with decision-making. That could contribute to higher risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think race directly correlates with criminal risk in a significant way, so maybe not a big factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. One arrest isn't a strong indicator of future behavior, especially since he might have had a minor offense or it was first-time. So this isn't a major red flag.\n\nHis physical description\u20145'8\" and 144 lbs\u2014is average, so not particularly concerning.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Living alone could mean more access to opportunities for criminal behavior if he's using his time unsupervised, but it's also common among young adults.\n\nEducation: He has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education might limit career prospects, which can sometimes lead to higher risk-taking, but there are other factors here too.\n\nEmployment: Held 4 jobs in the year. That shows responsibility and structure, which is a positive indicator as it suggests he's capable of holding down work, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in four years and feels not depressed recently. No recent drug use and mental health seems stable could reduce risk factors associated with substance abuse or impulsive crimes.\n\nHis background: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes be more conducive to higher crime rates, but family structure might provide support which reduces risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior positively by promoting ethical living and may deter criminal activity.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are neutral or positive. One arrest is minor, and he's working, not using drugs, and has a support system from religion. He doesn't show signs of current mental health issues or substance abuse. His past arrest might be a single incident without a history of repeated issues.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, the overall risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
