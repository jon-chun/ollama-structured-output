    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to break this down step by step. The user is asking for a risk assessment based on several factors provided about a 20-year-old male. They want a JSON response with either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a confidence score between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each of the risk factors listed:\n\n1. **Demographics**: The person is a White male, 5'6\", 135 lbs. He's never been married and lives alone. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. He's held five jobs this year, which shows some stability but not necessarily higher risk on its own.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: He's been arrested four times with convictions. This is a significant factor as prior arrests often correlate with higher recidivism rates. However, the nature of these arrests isn't specified, so I can't assume they're for violent crimes unless told otherwise.\n\n3. **Substance Use**: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and especially during the past month he feels down. This indicates possible drug use that could be contributing to his mood and potential criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household of four in an urban area with both biological parents suggests some stability but also possible exposure to stressors or environments that might contribute to higher risk factors.\n\n5. **Religious Beliefs**: He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life, which could indicate a lack of support system or guidance that some might find through religious beliefs.\n\nPutting this together, the key factors here are the criminal history and recent substance use. The combination of arrests, especially if they're for criminal offenses, and ongoing drug use can significantly increase risk. Without specific information on the nature of his arrests, I have to assume he's been involved in behavior that led to those convictions.\n\nThe fact that he feels down and has been using drugs recently could point towards potential issues with mental health or higher risk of further antisocial behavior. His job history is positive, indicating he can hold down employment, which might suggest some stability but doesn't negate the impact of criminal history and substance use.\n\nI also consider that living alone at 20 could mean he's more susceptible to negative influences without the support of a family structure. This isolation might exacerbate feelings of being down or lead him towards risky behaviors.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm fairly confident because criminal history is a strong indicator, but there are variables like the nature of arrests and whether substance use leads to further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
