    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but I don't know how much that alone contributes to risk. Maybe more about behavior or history?\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. So he's had some run-ins with the law, but no convictions. That could be a red flag because it suggests he might have engaged in criminal activity or at least been involved in situations that led to arrest.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\", 145 lbs. Not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe more about his environment or stress levels?\n\nHe hasn't married and is not living alone. He's either with family, a partner, or another situation. Living alone might be a factor in risk assessment because it could relate to independence or access to resources.\n\nEducational background: No high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can sometimes correlate with higher risks due to limited opportunities and potential stressors.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. So he has some work experience, which might indicate stability or financial security, but maybe not enough if he hasn't completed schooling.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive because substance abuse and mental health issues are often risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a rural area with a household of four. Rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics or access to resources, but I'm not sure how that ties in here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That's a religious belief which might influence his coping mechanisms or decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: He has an arrest history without a conviction, lower education, some work experience, no current substance use or depression, and a stable living situation. The lack of criminal convictions is tricky because it could mean he's not been convicted before but might have engaged in behavior that led to arrests. The absence of drug use and depression reduces some known risk factors. His religious beliefs might provide him with a support system or coping mechanisms.\n\nI'm not sure if the arrest history alone is enough to classify him as high risk without more information about the nature of the arrests or his criminal history beyond just one incident. Maybe there's more context needed, like whether the arrest was for minor offenses or more serious crimes. Without that detail, it's hard to assess accurately.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction because while he has some risk factors like an arrest record and lower education, other factors like no current substance abuse and stable living might mitigate those risks. However, without knowing the specifics of his past behavior or if he's had more serious interactions with the law, it's uncertain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
