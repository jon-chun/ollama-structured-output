    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted, which is a criminal history indicator. That's a red flag. Now, she's married and living with her spouse, which might suggest she has a stable lifestyle, but it doesn't negate her criminal past.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Limited education can be a risk factor as it may correlate with higher recidivism rates. She held one job last year, which shows some work history but isn't extensive enough to offset other risks.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently, which are positive signs as they indicate she's addressing substance issues and mental health. However, her past arrest might have been for drug-related offenses or something else.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a large household in a rural area. Growing up in a stable environment could be protective, but her current situation involves a recent conviction which complicates things.\n\nShe believes God plays a role in her life personally. Religiosity can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, but it's not the only factor to consider.\n\nLooking at all these factors, while some are protective (stable family background, no drug use, no depression), her criminal history is significant. Without more information on the nature of her past arrest, I have to assume it was a serious enough offense that could pose a high risk. Plus, limited education and being unmarried might increase risks compared to someone in a stable relationship with more support.\n\nI think she does present a moderate to high risk, so my confidence is around 75% based on the given factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
