    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not inherently high risk, but other factors might influence that.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, especially if there's a pattern or if the arrest was for a violent crime, which isn't specified here. Without knowing the nature of the arrest, it's hard to say.\n\nHis physical description is 6'0\" and 135 lbs. Not particularly notable in terms of risk factors.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability in living situation can be a protective factor, suggesting he has strong social ties which might reduce risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While not having higher education could be a concern, it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own unless combined with other factors like criminal history or substance abuse.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, indicating some level of employment stability, which can be a positive factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. The lack of recent drug use is a positive sign, as long-term substance abuse is often linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment can be protective, though urban areas might have higher crime rates, but his current situation seems stable now.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can sometimes be linked to lower risk behaviors, as it may provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest without conviction, some education, employment, no recent substance abuse or depression, stable living situation, and religious beliefs. These don't paint a clear picture of high risk. There's no mention of prior convictions, which would be more concerning. Without additional information about the nature of the arrest or any other potential red flags like criminal history, it seems he might not be at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
