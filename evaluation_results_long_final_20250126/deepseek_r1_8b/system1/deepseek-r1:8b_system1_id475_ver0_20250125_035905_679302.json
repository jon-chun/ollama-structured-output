Her arrest history shows two times without any convictions. That might suggest she's been in trouble but hasn't had a criminal record yet, which could be a good sign.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'2\" and 180 lbs. Not sure how that ties into risk factors directly, but maybe it's more about demographics.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. That might indicate she has a stable family life, which could be a protective factor.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college. She's held four jobs, so she's employed, another positive sign.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That might indicate some substance usage, but without more severe issues like addiction or recent depression, it's not a major red flag.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Early stable family environment could be protective. She also mentions God plays a role in her life personally, which might relate to her personal beliefs and coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting this together: No criminal convictions, some stability in marriage and employment, current substance use but not severe, and positive personal beliefs. These factors don't point towards high risk. So the prediction would be NO with moderate confidence around 60.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
