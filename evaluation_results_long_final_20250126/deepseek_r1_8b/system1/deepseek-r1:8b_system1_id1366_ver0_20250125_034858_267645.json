    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this risk factors case for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age might be a factor here; younger individuals can sometimes have higher risk tendencies due to impulsivity or less experience in managing risky behaviors.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one arrest, which isn't too severe on its own but indicates some prior criminal behavior. The fact that she was convicted means she's had contact with the justice system before, which could be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHer physical description is 5 feet 4 inches and between 125-149 lbs. Not particularly notable, so I don't think this affects the risk assessment much.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that could deter her from engaging in risky behaviors or that might help her avoid criminal activities.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can influence future opportunities, but it's not clear how this ties into potential risks yet.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the year. Employment indicates stability, which could be a protective factor against criminal behavior. People with steady jobs might have less time or fewer motivations to engage in illegal activities.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if she's been using within the recent past. The substances involved (marijuana and cocaine) are both illicit and can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of current depression symptoms might reduce some risks associated with mental health issues that could lead to criminal behavior. However, her history of drug use could have contributed to previous mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a larger family and an urban environment might expose her to different stressors or influences, which could increase risk factors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens personally. Religiosity can sometimes be protective, but it's also possible that she uses this belief as justification for certain behaviors, potentially complicating the assessment.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a history of arrest and conviction, which is a strong indicator. Her drug use is recent, which increases the likelihood of ongoing risky behavior. Her current employment might offer some stability, but the presence of past drug use could indicate underlying issues that may persist. The lack of depression symptoms in the past month could suggest she's managing her mental health well now, but we don't know about the past.\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially the arrest history and recent drug use, it seems like she might pose a high risk. The confidence level isn't certain because while there are clear red flags, some protective factors exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
