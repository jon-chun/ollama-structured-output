    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors and determine if it's a high risk situation. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female, which is young but not necessarily a red flag on its own. She identifies as White, which might be relevant in certain contexts but I don't know if that directly impacts risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted, so she does have a criminal history, which is a bit concerning. But the fact that it's only one arrest and conviction might not alone indicate high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'9\" and 135 lbs. Not sure how that plays into it unless weight affects her ability to commit certain crimes, but I don't think so. Maybe if she's using drugs, but the weight could be related to drug use or health.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has more access to opportunities for criminal activity since there are no others around to witness or stop her. Or it might make her more isolated, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate lower educational attainment, which is sometimes associated with higher rates of criminal behavior because education can be a deterrent.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs during the year. That's not bad; it shows she's capable of holding down employment, which might suggest she has some structure in her life. But I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment.\n\nDrugs: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and in the past month, she felt really down. That's concerning because drug use can lead to criminal behavior or other risky actions. The feeling of being \"down\" could indicate potential for higher risk behaviors like theft or violence if she's using drugs to cope.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 when young. I don't know how that affects risk, but maybe larger households can have different dynamics that influence behavior later on.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That could be seen as a factor that might influence her decisions or coping mechanisms. Sometimes people turn to religion or spirituality for guidance, but it could also be a source of stress if she feels like her life is outside of her control.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young, has a criminal history, uses drugs, feels down, lives alone, and isn't in college. These factors could increase her risk, especially considering that drug use often correlates with higher risk behaviors. Living alone might make it harder to have support systems, which can lead to more risky decisions.\n\nI'm not sure if the fact that she's held 4 jobs is a mitigating factor or not. On one hand, having a job shows responsibility and structure, but on the other, maybe her job isn't in a criminal field, so it doesn't directly affect risk.\n\nThe combination of drug use, feeling down, and criminal history does point towards higher risk. The prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence score around 70-80 because there are several concerning factors, but not all extremely high-risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
