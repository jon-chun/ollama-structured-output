    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on the information provided. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their implications.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Being young and part of a minority group can sometimes be a risk factor due to higher rates of interaction with the criminal justice system. However, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHe has been arrested six times but not convicted. This suggests he's involved in criminal activity but hasn't been formally charged or convicted yet. Arrest history can be indicative of higher risk, especially if there's a pattern.\n\nHis physical description is 6'2\" and 140 lbs. While height and weight aren't direct indicators of risk, they might influence behavior or interactions with authorities.\n\nHe has never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean he lacks supportive social structures, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or not having\u76d1\u7763\u3002\n\nHis educational status: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it may limit employment opportunities and contribute to higher criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment, especially for someone in their early 20s, is concerning because it can lead to financial stress and higher involvement in criminal activities to support themselves.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, including all of the past month. Recent and persistent drug use significantly increases the risk of criminal behavior, as substance abuse is a known correlate of crime.\n\nHe feels consistently down during the past month and considers God's involvement in his personal life. This could indicate mental health issues such as depression or anxiety, which are risk factors for criminal behavior. Reliance on religion might also influence his coping mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is a positive or negative factor.\n\nHe comes from a household of four at a young age. Growing up in a larger family might have provided some support, but since he's living alone now and hasn't held a job, the lack of support structures could be contributing factors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: arrest history, drug use, unemployment, low education level, and potential mental health issues. These elements are strongly associated with higher risk of criminal behavior. Each factor individually is concerning, but collectively they create a significant risk profile.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
