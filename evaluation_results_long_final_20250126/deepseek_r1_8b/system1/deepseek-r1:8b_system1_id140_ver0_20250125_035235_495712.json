    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor that could be relevant, but on its own, it might not be a strong indicator of higher risk unless coupled with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted, which suggests a history of illegal activity. This is a significant red flag because a prior criminal record often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis physical description\u20145 feet 7 inches and 154 lbs\u2014isn't particularly indicative of risk. Physical build doesn't usually correlate directly with criminal behavior unless there's other factors at play, like socioeconomic status or substance use.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to social isolation, which is linked to higher recidivism. However, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a well-known predictor of higher involvement in the criminal justice system because it limits employment opportunities and can contribute to economic hardship, which is a strain on individuals and communities.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, but if he's only had two jobs in a year, maybe they aren't secure or long-term, which could indicate economic instability.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent use of marijuana is concerning because it's linked to criminal behavior and can contribute to higher recidivism rates. Additionally, he feels down \"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\" some days during the past month. This indicates potential mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which are known risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can be more challenging due to higher crime rates and socioeconomic pressures. A large family size might have contributed to inadequate supervision or modeling of positive behaviors.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of control over events, which might influence his decision-making processes in ways that could lead to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: prior arrests and convictions, lack of education, substance use, potential mental health issues, living alone, employment instability, and an urban upbringing with a large family size\u2014these factors significantly increase the risk. Each of these elements contributes to higher recidivism rates and involvement in the criminal justice system.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
