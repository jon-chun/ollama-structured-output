    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female, White, which might be relevant in terms of demographic factors that could influence judicial outcomes.\n\nShe has seven arrests and convictions. That's significant because a history of criminal activity suggests higher risk. Each arrest isn't necessarily a conviction, but having been convicted indicates past conduct that led to legal consequences.\n\nHer physical description is 6'0\" and between 175-199 lbs. Not sure how relevant body size is here unless it relates to something specific like physical health or ability to commit certain crimes, which isn't detailed.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone, which might indicate she has fewer support systems. Living alone could be a risk factor if it affects her stability or access to resources that might deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a predictor of higher risk as it might correlate with lower employment opportunities, economic instability, and involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which is better than none but still indicates she may not have stable income or support, potentially increasing her risk factors.\n\nShe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use can be a significant indicator of higher risk, especially if it's within the past month as mentioned.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently with nothing cheering her up. This could point to mental health issues like depression, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household in an urban environment can have adverse effects on behavior and may contribute to higher risk factors.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal outcomes. This could imply religious beliefs that might influence her behavior or views on justice, possibly affecting how she interacts with the legal system.\n\nPutting all this together: arrest history, current drug use, possible mental health issues, lack of education and stable living, and a challenging upbringing in an urban environment are all red flags. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
