    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who hasn't been convicted but has been arrested once. That's not a strong indicator on its own, especially since she hasn't been convicted yet. Maybe she got charges dropped or is awaiting trial.\n\nShe's using drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently she feels really down. The drug use could be a risk factor, but how recent is the use? She used them in the past month, which might indicate more current substance abuse.\n\nHer mental state seems concerning because she's been feeling so down that nothing cheers her up. That's a red flag for possible mental health issues. Feeling down or hopeless can lead to higher risks of various negative behaviors.\n\nShe has two jobs and is not enrolled in college after having a GED. Employment suggests she's responsible, but maybe she's struggling with something else given the feelings of despair.\n\nLiving with both parents in an urban area as a child might have exposed her to more stressors or environmental factors that could contribute to higher risk behaviors. Also, her belief in God's influence on her personal life could indicate a different coping mechanism, which might be positive or negative depending on how she uses it.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014arrest history without conviction, current drug use, mental health concerns, and some stability with jobs\u2014it's a mix of potential risks. Her current feelings of despair are significant, but without more information about her criminal history beyond the one arrest, it's hard to say if that's directly related. However, the combination of substance abuse and emotional distress could heighten the risk. She might be at risk for more serious behavior due to her mental state and drug use.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but based on the factors given, especially the recent feelings of despair and current substance use, it seems like a high-risk scenario.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
