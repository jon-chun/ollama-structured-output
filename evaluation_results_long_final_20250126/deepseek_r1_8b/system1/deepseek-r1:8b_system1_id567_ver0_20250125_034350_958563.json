    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factors for a criminal justice risk assessment. The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which might be a red flag. His physical stats are average\u20145'10\", 145 lbs. He's married and living with his spouse, which could indicate he has a stable home life.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, which is concerning because it limits educational achievements and future opportunities. He's held two jobs this year, which shows some responsibility. His drug use is nil for the past four years, and he hasn't felt depressed recently, suggesting he's stable mentally.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a rural area as a young child\u2014rural backgrounds can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors due to different community dynamics or access to resources. Religiously, he believes God plays a role in his life, which might influence his decision-making.\n\nConsidering all these points: arrest history is low (only one), no current convictions, stable living situation, employment, lack of substance use, mental stability, and some education through jobs but not formal education. His background includes growing up in a potentially challenging environment, which could contribute to higher risk factors as he might have learned certain behaviors or been exposed to situations that increase recidivism risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because despite some positive indicators like employment and current stability, the lack of formal education and his early living situation could be concerning. The belief in God's influence might also impact decision-making, potentially leading to higher risk behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
