    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if this person is at high risk based on the given criteria. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that might influence risk assessment in certain contexts, but I'm not sure how significant it is here without more info.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can indicate higher risk of recidivism, especially if there are prior issues, but since she hasn't been convicted, her criminal history isn't as established. However, the fact that she's been arrested suggests possible involvement with the justice system.\n\nHer height is 5'7\", which doesn't seem particularly notable. Maybe in some contexts, like physical ability or vulnerability, but not directly related to risk assessment here.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate she has fewer support systems, which could be a risk factor for things like substance abuse or other issues. It can also mean she's more isolated, potentially leading to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher rates of criminal activity and poverty, which are risk factors. Without educational attainments, she might face more challenges in securing employment, which can contribute to delinquency or further issues.\n\nShe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities as a means of income. This could be a significant factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of ongoing substance abuse, which is a high-risk factor for further criminal behavior and poorer outcomes in various aspects of her life.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. The lack of current depression symptoms might not directly indicate her mental health status over a longer period. It's possible that she has experienced depression in the past or could be at risk of developing it, which would be another factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2. Growing up in a single-parent household can have negative effects on a person's development and may increase the likelihood of behavioral issues. Additionally, having only two people might mean there were limited resources or inconsistent parenting, which are risk factors.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal outcomes. This could indicate a sense of control or external locus of control, which can be both positive (religion as a coping mechanism) and negative if it leads to risky behaviors influenced by religious beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together, several factors stand out as high-risk indicators: her arrest history, unemployment, drug use, lack of education, and living situation. Each of these can contribute to higher risk behaviors, especially considering she hasn't been convicted but has had run-ins with the law. The lack of educational and employment stability further exacerbates this risk.\n\nHer substance abuse is a particularly concerning factor because it's recent (within four years) and could lead to more severe issues down the line. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which might drive criminal activities as a means of survival or for other reasons. The household she grew up in might have provided an environment that was not supportive, possibly contributing to her current situation.\n\nWhile her mental health doesn't show depression recently, there's no information about past episodes or ongoing mental health issues, so I can't use that as a factor here. However, the combination of these other risk factors is substantial enough to suggest high risk.\n\nI'm also considering the judicial system's perspective. Her two arrests could indicate familiarity with the justice system, which might increase her likelihood of future interactions if she continues on a similar path. The lack of education and employment makes reintegration into society difficult, possibly leading to more criminal charges.\n\nIn summary, while not all factors alone are determinative, their combination strongly suggests high risk. I'm fairly confident in this assessment based on the presence of multiple high-risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
