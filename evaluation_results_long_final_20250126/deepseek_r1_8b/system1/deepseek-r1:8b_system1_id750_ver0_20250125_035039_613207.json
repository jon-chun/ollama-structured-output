    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it's not necessarily indicative of higher risk. However, considering other factors might change that perception.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrest history can sometimes be a sign of higher risk, especially if there are multiple arrests or if they involve violent offenses. But here, he only has one arrest with no conviction, so maybe not as concerning yet.\n\nHis physical description is 6'2\" and over 250 lbs. While being larger could be a factor in certain situations, like resisting arrest or causing harm to others, it's not directly linked to criminal risk without more context.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, as there might be less supervision or accountability. But again, this isn't definitive on its own.\n\nHe is enrolled in school, which suggests he's engaged in a positive activity and has structure in his life. This could mitigate some risks by providing routine and responsibility.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year, indicating he's employed, which is another positive factor as it shows he's contributing to society financially and has commitments.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent or involves more serious drugs. However, not feeling depressed in the past month might indicate improved mental health, which could reduce some risks.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally positive and could reduce risk factors compared to unstable environments.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor, as it often correlates with higher levels of social support and lower rates of delinquency.\n\nPutting all this together: he's arrested once, has some negative behaviors (drug use), but also has positive factors like employment, school enrollment, stable family background, and religious beliefs. The fact that he hasn't been convicted yet might mean he's at a lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions or more severe issues.\n\nThe drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent, but without knowing the severity or if it's impacting other areas of his life, it's hard to say it's a high-risk factor on its own. The lack of depression could indicate he's managing stressors effectively.\n\nHis enrollment in school and employment suggest he's working towards goals, which are protective factors. His family background in an urban area but with both parents might provide some level of support or stability.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the overall risk is moderate rather than high. He has some red flags like past drug use and an arrest, but strong mitigating factors that could lower his likelihood of re-offending or causing harm.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
