    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old male. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, he's White and hasn't been convicted despite two arrests. That might lower the immediate risk since convictions are often tied to higher recidivism.\n\nHe's employed with three jobs in the past year, which is a positive indicator as it suggests stability. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe he's seeking other ways to improve his situation.\n\nHis substance use includes marijuana recently and some feelings of being down in the dumps. Recent drug use can be a risk factor, especially if combined with other issues like emotional instability.\n\nHe comes from a background where he lived with his mother in a rural area as a child. That might contribute to his current mental health or stress levels. Also, his lack of belief in God could indicate a different coping mechanism, which might affect how he handles stress or conflict.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past arrests without convictions, some substance use, emotional issues, and a stable job. He doesn't have a criminal history beyond arrests, which is a mitigating factor. His employment suggests he's actively seeking to improve his situation, which could reduce risk. However, his recent drug use and feelings of despair might point towards higher risk behavior.\n\nI'm a bit torn because while there are negative factors like substance use and emotional distress, the lack of criminal history and stable job might counterbalance that. I think it leans more towards a moderate risk but not necessarily high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
