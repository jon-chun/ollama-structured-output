    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors provided and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's relevant because age, gender, and ethnicity can influence various behaviors. Being young and male might be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests he has a criminal history. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential risk in further criminal activities.\n\nHis physical description: 6'3\" and between 175-199 lbs. While height and weight can vary, this alone isn't a high-risk indicator, but combined with other factors, it might contribute to behaviors like substance abuse or aggression.\n\nHe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone could mean he has more access to substances or fewer accountability structures, which might increase risk.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor as it's linked to lower income, higher unemployment, and potential criminal activity.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Unstable employment or limited work experience is often associated with economic stress, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and was feeling down a lot recently. Recent heavy substance use, especially if coupled with negative emotions, can heighten risk of further issues.\n\nHis upbringing: Lived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Family structure and environment can influence behavior. A large family might have provided more supervision or support, but without knowing the dynamics, it's hard to say. Being rural could mean less access to resources or different social influences.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his personal life.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0a\u5e1d\u6307\u5bfc\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u884c\u4e8b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\n\nPutting it all together, having a criminal history, limited education, unstable employment, drug use, and negative mental state are significant red flags. These factors often correlate with higher recidivism rates and increased risk of future criminal activity. While some factors like his religious beliefs might mitigate risk, the overall combination suggests a high likelihood.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
