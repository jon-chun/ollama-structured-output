    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor assessment for a 20-year-old female. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, she's White and hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. That suggests she might not have a criminal history beyond that single incident, which is a good sign.\n\nHer weight is 180 lbs at 5'0\", which is on the higher side for her height, but I'm not sure how relevant that is to risk factors unless it relates to health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Being independent might indicate she's managing things on her own, which could be a positive factor or a potential stress point if she feels isolated.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college, but she's held nine jobs in a year. That shows she has work experience and is employed, which are both positives as they contribute to stability.\n\nHer drug use includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and she's felt down in the dumps recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor, especially if she's using harder drugs like cocaine. The recent feelings of sadness could indicate stress or mental health issues, which might increase her risk of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nShe grew up in a large household in a rural area with both biological parents. That's a stable background, but I'm not sure how that affects her current situation unless there are unresolved family issues.\n\nHer belief in God and personal involvement of religion in her life could be a protective factor if it provides her with support or moral guidance. However, if she uses religion to cope with stress, it might not address the root causes.\n\nConsidering all these points: she has some risk factors like drug use and possible mental health issues, but she also has positive indicators like employment and living independently. The key here is her recent emotional state and past drug use, which are significant concerns that could increase her risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 9 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
