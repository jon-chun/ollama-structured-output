    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's a 19-year-old female who's been arrested four times but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can be a red flag because they show a history of illegal activity, even if she wasn't convicted. But I need to consider other factors too.\n\nShe lives with her mother in an urban area, along with two others. That's a household size of three, which might offer some support or supervision, but it's also a busy environment. Past drug use is another point\u2014she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug usage can sometimes lead to more severe criminal behavior or reoffending, so that's concerning.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase reliance on criminal activities for income or status. She's held two jobs this year, which is positive because it indicates she has some structure and income stability, which might reduce risks.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so there's no current indication of emotional instability that could exacerbate criminal behavior. Her faith in God being a factor in her personal life might provide her with a sense of purpose or social support, which could be protective.\n\nConsidering all these factors: arrests without convictions, past drug use, lack of education, and household situation. The presence of two jobs is a positive indicator, but the other factors lean towards higher risk. Without a criminal conviction, it's hard to definitively say she's high risk, but the pattern of behavior suggests potential for higher risk. I'm leaning towards 'YES' with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
