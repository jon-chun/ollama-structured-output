    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, which is a young adult. Being young might increase the likelihood of certain behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own. He identifies as White, which could be relevant in some contexts, but without more info, I'm not sure how much that affects risk here.\n\nHe has two arrests and one conviction. Two arrests suggest he's had interactions with the law before, which is a concerning sign. The fact that it resulted in a conviction means there was a formal judgment against him, so this factor leans towards higher risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not particularly concerning on its own. Job history: he's held two jobs in the year. Stable employment can sometimes indicate lower risk factors, but it doesn't negate past issues with substance use or legal problems.\n\nHe hasn't married and lives alone, which is common at his age and could be neutral or even positive if he's managing independently. Education-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower education levels can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors like drug use or criminal activity, so this is another point towards potential risk.\n\nSubstance use: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has felt down in the dumps recently. Recent mood issues could indicate possible mental health concerns, which are often linked to higher risk behaviors. Previous substance use history, especially with cocaine, can be a significant indicator of higher risk factors.\n\nHis upbringing: He lived with his biological dad in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and may expose individuals to more risk factors. However, without info on whether the household was stable or problematic, it's hard to assess its impact.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. This could influence his coping mechanisms or decision-making, but I'm not sure how this directly affects risk without more context.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like past arrests and convictions, substance use history, mood issues, and lower education level are concerning. His age and employment might mitigate some of these risks, but the combination of legal problems, drug use, and emotional distress suggests a higher likelihood of continued problematic behavior or recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
