Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is mixed race and 5'8\", weighing 148 lbs. Her marital status is married and living with her spouse, which might indicate some stability. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't in college, which could be a risk factor as education levels are linked to lower criminal involvement.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted, so she has a history of legal issues. Her current situation includes using cocaine in the past four years and feeling consistently down for the past month. The inability to feel cheered up can be a sign of mental health issues like depression.\n\nHer background includes living with her biological mother in an urban area with a household of three at a young age. Growing up in a larger family might have exposed her to different influences, possibly leading to higher risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these points: past criminal history, current substance use, possible mental health struggles, lack of education, and challenging upbringing\u2014these are all high-risk indicators. Each factor contributes to an increased likelihood of further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
