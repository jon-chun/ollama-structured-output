    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. So, the person is a 19-year-old female, White, married, living with her spouse. She's had two arrests and convictions, so that's a red flag for criminal history. Her age is 19, which might indicate she's still young and possibly less established in life.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't enrolled in college. That could mean she's less educated, which might limit her job opportunities and increase her risk of engaging in criminal activities for survival or other reasons.\n\nShe has held one job during the year, so she's employed, but maybe not enough to sustain herself financially. She uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine, which is another risk factor related to substance abuse.\n\nShe feels down a lot, which could point towards mental health issues. At a young age, she lived in a rural area with her biological mother in a household of four. That's a big family, but without knowing the dynamics, it's hard to say if that's supportive or not. She also believes in God's influence on her life, which might be a form of religious belief but could also be a coping mechanism.\n\nHer criminal history is two arrests and convictions\u2014so she has had interactions with the justice system before. That's concerning because it suggests she's already been involved in some criminal activities. The fact that she's married and living with her spouse might indicate she has a stable family life, which could be a protective factor, but her substance use and financial situation might complicate that.\n\nConsidering all these factors: criminal history, low education, employment issues, substance abuse, mental health indicators (feeling down), and possible lack of support from family. These seem to converge towards higher risk. She's had two arrests, which suggests she's been involved in some form of illegal activity before, and the other factors might increase her likelihood of recidivism or further criminal behavior.\n\nI'm not sure about how much weight to give each factor, but they all point towards high risk. The confidence level I'd assign is around 85 because while there are several red flags, it's also influenced by the fact that she has a stable marriage and perhaps some protective factors, which might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
