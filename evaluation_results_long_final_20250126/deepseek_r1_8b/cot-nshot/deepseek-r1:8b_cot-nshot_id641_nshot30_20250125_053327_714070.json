    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one and assigning a weight based on how significant it seems compared to others.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once and convicted. That's a point against her, but considering she only has one arrest, maybe it's not extremely high. I think this is a medium risk factor because having prior convictions increases the chances of recidivism but it's not as impactful as, say, multiple arrests or more severe crimes.\n\nNext, she's 19 years old. Younger individuals are generally more likely to reoffend due to lower self-control and decision-making abilities. So this is probably a high risk factor because age plays a significant role in recidivism rates.\n\nHer weight is 120 lbs at 5'8\". I'm not sure how much BMI affects recidivism, but being underweight might indicate potential stress or instability which could contribute to further issues. Maybe low since it's not directly linked to criminal behavior as far as I know.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it may lead to more exposure to situations that could lead to recidivism, but without family support, maybe medium. It's a bit of a nuanced factor.\n\nHaving a GED is actually positive, so this is a low risk factor. Education often correlates with lower crime rates, so this is a good sign.\n\nShe held 3 jobs last year. Stable employment usually reduces the likelihood of recidivism because it provides structure and income. This seems like a high positive factor, so I might give it a medium to high weight since job stability is protective.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is another positive. Substance abuse is a big contributor to criminal behavior, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe sometimes feels down and has felt depressed recently. Depression can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a way to cope with emotions. This is probably a medium risk since mental health issues can lead to recidivism but it's not the most significant factor alone.\n\nShe lived with her mother in an urban area when she was young. Urban environments may have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe in God or religion. Studies show that religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without strong ties to a faith community, maybe this is a low risk factor because it's not directly tied to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the factors with higher weights are prior conviction, age, job stability, and mental health issues. Lower ones are education level and having no drug history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having a prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend due to lower self-control\"),\n    (\"body_weight\", \"low\", \"BMI is not directly linked to criminal behavior but can indicate stress\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase exposure to negative situations\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED indicates higher education levels, which reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Job stability provides structure and income, reducing recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use is a positive factor as substance abuse is a major contributor to crime\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"household_size_young\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion_belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief is not directly tied to criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
