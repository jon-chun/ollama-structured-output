    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this case to analyze for predicting whether the person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. His age being 19 might make him more prone to certain risks compared to someone older or younger, but I'm not sure if that's directly a risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That suggests he might have had multiple run-ins with the law, which could indicate higher risk behavior. Maybe he hasn't learned from previous mistakes or hasn't received proper intervention yet.\n\nHis weight is 290 lbs, which is on the heavier side. I'm not sure how that directly ties to recidivism, but being overweight can sometimes be associated with health issues or other behaviors that might contribute to criminal activity indirectly.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have a strong support system or supervision, which could increase the chances of reoffending. Without a stable environment, it's easier to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nHaving a GED certificate shows he has some education, which can be a positive factor by indicating he's motivated to improve his situation. Not being enrolled in college might mean he's not focused on building a better life through education, but having a GED is still a good sign.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability could provide structure and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. One job isn't much, though; maybe he needs more consistent work or better employment opportunities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive because drug use can lead to further criminal activity. His lack of recent drug use might lower his risk compared to someone who is still using.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but that's a short timeframe. It doesn't tell us much about long-term mental health issues, which could be linked to recidivism. However, feeling good mentally now is a plus.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a two-parent household can provide better support and supervision, which might reduce the risk of reoffending. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so that's another factor to consider.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his situation. Religiosity or a lack thereof can influence behavior. Believing in a higher power might provide moral guidance, but not having such beliefs could increase the risk if he lacks a sense of purpose or accountability.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, factors like prior arrests and being un employed were weighted as high. His three arrests are similar to someone with multiple prior convictions, so that's a strong indicator.\n\nHis job history is minimal, which aligns with high risk. Not having stable employment makes it harder to stay out of trouble.\n\nLiving alone without a support system could also be medium-high. Without supervision or guidance, it's easier to engage in criminal activities.\n\nHis education level (GED) might mitigate some risks, so maybe that's low-medium.\n\nThe lack of drug use is positive, so that's low.\n\nHis upbringing in a two-parent household in an urban area seems protective, so that's medium.\n\nNot believing in God could be high risk since it might indicate a lack of accountability or guidance.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks are prior arrests and job instability. The lower risks include having a GED and no recent drug use. The moderately risky factors are living alone and upbringing.\n\nSo, weighting them as high for prior arrests, high for job stability, medium for living alone and upbringing, low-medium for education, low for no drugs, and high for lack of belief in God.\n\nAdding all these together, the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence because the high-weighted factors strongly indicate a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested multiple times increases the risk of further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"high\", \"Minimal job history indicates potential instability and increased risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of support system may contribute to higher risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"education_ged\", \"low\", \"GED certificate suggests some motivation for improvement\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing in a two-parent household provides some protection against recidivism\"),\n    (\"god_belief\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief in a higher power may increase risk of criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
