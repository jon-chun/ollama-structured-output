    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one and assigning a weight based on what I've learned from the previous examples.\n\nFirst off, she's been arrested once and convicted. From the examples, it seems like prior convictions are taken pretty seriously. In example 3, someone with 17 arrests was predicted to be rearrested, but without more info on her past offense or its severity, maybe I should consider this as medium risk since a single conviction can indicate some criminal history.\n\nHer weight is 115 lbs, which is on the lower side. Looking at examples, being underweight wasn't directly mentioned, but in example 27, someone who was heavier (219 lbs) wasn't rearrested. Maybe her weight isn't a major factor here, so I'll give this a low weight.\n\nShe's married and currently living alone. From example 2, someone not living alone had higher recidivism, so maybe being married provides some stability. But she's living alone now, which could be a risk factor. Hmm, conflicting info. Maybe medium since marital status can both help and hinder, depending on circumstances.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. From the examples, lack of education was a significant factor. In example 27, someone without an education wasn't rearrested, but others with similar backgrounds were. It seems like this is a medium to high risk factor because lower educational attainment correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nShe's held only one job this year. In example 2, someone who didn't hold any jobs was rearrested, and in example 28, someone with three jobs had a high risk. So having minimal employment might be low, as she has at least some work history.\n\nShe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. From examples, drug use itself isn't conclusive. In example 3, someone who used drugs was rearrested, while others like her weren't. It seems like moderate to high risk based on substance abuse history.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Looking at example 27, someone who was depressed wasn't rearrested, so maybe not feeling depressed is a low risk factor as mental health issues can sometimes be protective.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size five. From examples, larger households didn't directly correlate, but having a stable family might reduce recidivism. So this could be a lower risk factor since she had at least some family support growing up.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal matters. In example 28, someone with strong religious beliefs was rearrested, so perhaps her lack of belief is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks seem to be her criminal history and educational status, each being high or medium. The rest of the factors are lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction indicates some criminal history\"),\n    (\"educational_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held only one job, which may provide some stability\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed might be a protective factor\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with family which can offer support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious beliefs doesn't directly correlate to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
