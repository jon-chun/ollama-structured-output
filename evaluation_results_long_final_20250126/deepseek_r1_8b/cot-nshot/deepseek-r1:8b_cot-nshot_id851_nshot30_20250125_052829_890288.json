    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big factor. He's 21, which is considered young in the justice system. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have developed better decision-making skills or stability in their lives.\n\nNext, his criminal history. He's been arrested twice and convicted. That's two strikes against him. A history of convictions suggests he's had issues with the law before, which increases the chance he'll do it again.\n\nHis current job situation is that he has held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to stress or financial difficulties, which might push someone towards criminal behavior as a way to cope. So this factor could be another point in favor of higher recidivism.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. A stable family life can provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. But he has no job, so maybe that stability is being tested.\n\nHis weight is 207 lbs., which is on the heavier side. While it's not directly linked to crime, obesity or being overweight can be associated with health issues and stress, which might contribute indirectly to recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. This is a positive sign because his substance use isn't a current issue. However, drug use often goes hand-in-hand with other criminal behaviors, so this could mean he's more stable now.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health plays a role in behavior. If he's not currently struggling with depression, that might reduce his likelihood of committing crimes as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four with both biological parents. Larger families can provide more support and supervision, which is usually beneficial. But it's also possible that he had access to better resources or role models growing up.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor against crime by providing moral guidance and social support.\n\nPutting all these together: He's young, has a criminal history, is unemployed, hasn't used drugs recently, and isn't depressed. His stable family life and religious beliefs might help, but his past convictions and current joblessness are concerning. \n\nI think the key factors here are his age (high risk), criminal history (very high), unemployment (high), and lack of substance use (low). Maybe I should assign higher weights to age, criminal history, and employment, and lower to the others.\n\nSo, assigning medium to religious beliefs and household size because they're positive but not as impactful as other factors. Lack of depression is a plus but maybe not as significant.\n\nFinal prediction: He has several risk factors pointing towards recidivism, especially being young and having prior convictions. But his current stability might help him avoid it. It's a bit of a toss-up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"very_high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"no_substance_use\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
