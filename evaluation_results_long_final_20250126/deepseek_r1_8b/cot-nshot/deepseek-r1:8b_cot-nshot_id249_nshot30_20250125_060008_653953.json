    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. The person is 19 years old, which is relatively young. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might not have established strong bonds or motivations to avoid criminal behavior.\n\nNext, prior arrests and convictions. He's been arrested once and convicted. A history of arrest increases the likelihood of future rearrests, especially if there's a pattern or if he's part of a criminal network.\n\nHis current weight is between 225 and 249 lbs. I'm not sure how this directly affects recidivism, but being overweight might correlate with other risk factors like substance abuse or mental health issues, which could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more opportunities for criminal activity, as there's less supervision or accountability. On the other hand, it might also mean he doesn't have a stable support system, which could increase his chances of getting rearrested.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education is a positive factor that can reduce recidivism by providing structure and goals. However, given that he has a prior conviction, his ability to focus on school might be limited, especially if there are financial or personal issues complicating his situation.\n\nHe held three jobs this year. Employment can also be a protective factor as it provides stability and reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. Having multiple jobs suggests some responsibility, which could mitigate recidivism risks.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and rearrests. Regular drug use often leads to more interactions with the criminal justice system.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but this might be a one-month snapshot. Mental health issues, including depression, are known risk factors for recidivism. If he's experiencing mental health problems, even if not currently depressed, it's possible they could affect his behavior in the future.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a two-parent household is generally protective, but since he's now 19 and making decisions on his own, the influence of his upbringing might still be present. Urban environments can also expose individuals to more criminal activities and stressors.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of purpose or external control, which might either positively or negatively influence his behavior depending on how he interprets it. It might provide him with a support system or moral framework, but if it leads to religious activity that conflicts with the law, it could be a risk factor.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, several factors like age, prior convictions, drug use, and employment status had varying weights. Factors like current mental health and parental upbringing also played roles. For this person, I think his age and history of substance abuse are high risks. His employment might mitigate that, but only to a medium extent. Living with both parents was protective, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, considering the factors:\n\n- Age: High\n- Prior convictions: High\n- Substance use: High\n- Employment: Medium\n- Mental health (current): Low\n- Parental support: Low\n\nSo the overall prediction would lean towards \"YES\" for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"parental_support\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
