    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. She's a 19-year-old married woman who has been arrested twice but not convicted. I'll need to look at each risk factor individually.\n\nFirst, her criminal history: two arrests without convictions. That's a low number, so maybe that's a medium or low risk factor since she hasn't had any successful convictions leading to imprisonment.\n\nNext, her weight is 140 lbs and height is 5'5\". Body weight isn't directly tied to criminal behavior, but overall health could play a role in substance abuse. I'll consider this as a low factor because without more info, it's hard to link it to recidivism.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Family support might reduce the chances of returning to criminal activities, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHer education level: no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can increase the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities as it limits job opportunities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe has held only one job this year. Job stability is important; having a steady income reduces stress which can lead to criminal behavior. One job isn't much, so maybe this is medium risk because it's not strong evidence of stable employment.\n\nSubstance abuse: she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use itself is a high risk factor as it's associated with higher recidivism rates. However, she has a spouse, which might provide support to help her quit or reduce use, so maybe medium.\n\nHer mood was down during the past month. Depression or stress can lead to criminal behavior, especially drug-related. This is definitely a high risk because emotional instability can increase the likelihood of relapse or new crimes.\n\nShe comes from a household of size 3 with her biological mother in rural areas. A single-parent family might have economic and social challenges that contribute to criminal behavior. The rural setting might limit access to resources, so this could be medium to high risk.\n\nHer belief in God's influence on her life: considering she thinks religion plays a role, it might mean she seeks guidance from faith-based programs or support, potentially reducing recidivism. So maybe low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n- Criminal history: 2 arrests, no convictions \u2013 Low\n- Body weight/height: Low\n- Marriage: Low\n- Education: High\n- Employment: Medium\n- Substance abuse: High\n- Mood: High\n- Family background: Medium to High\n- Religion: Low\n\nI need to assign weights. The most significant factors seem to be education (High), substance abuse (High), and mood (High). These three are all high risk factors, so the prediction leans towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"body_weight_height\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mood_depression\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion_belief\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
