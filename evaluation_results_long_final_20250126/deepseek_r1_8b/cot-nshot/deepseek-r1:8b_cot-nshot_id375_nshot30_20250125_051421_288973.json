    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the likelihood of this individual being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. The person is 21 years old. From what I know, younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may have higher impulsivity. So, I'll consider this as a high risk factor.\n\nNext, criminal history. He's been arrested 3 times and convicted, which means he has a history of engaging in behavior that leads to arrest. Having prior convictions strongly correlates with recidivism because it indicates a pattern of behavior that continues despite legal consequences. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis current employment status is another point. He's held 3 jobs this year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, providing structure and financial stability which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, he's currently not living alone. Living with others might mean less accountability and more exposure to negative influences or stressors that could contribute to recidivism. So, his current situation is a bit mixed. I think this is medium risk.\n\nHe does not have a high school diploma or GED, nor is he enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and life skills, increasing the chances of falling into criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is associated with higher rates of criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that his substance use isn't currently driving problematic behavior. Still, having recently used drugs is concerning enough to be considered a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone, which could mean he lacks the support systems that married individuals or those in stable living arrangements often have. This lack of social support can increase vulnerability to criminal behavior. So, this is another high risk factor.\n\nHis current weight is 135 lbs., height is 5'11\". I'm not sure how relevant physical build is here, but being within a normal weight range might not directly impact recidivism much. Maybe low or medium, but it's less significant than the other factors.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior by promoting values and social connections that discourage crime. However, without knowing how strong his religious beliefs are, it's hard to assess. Still, given that he attributes his outcomes to God, there might be some influence keeping him on a more positive path, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: age (high), criminal history (high), employment (medium), education (high), substance use (medium), living situation (high), and religiosity (low). Each of these factors contributes to recidivism differently, but the strongest factors are age, criminal history, education, and living situation, each being high risk. Substance use is medium because he hasn't been using recently, which might reduce immediate risks.\n\nSo, considering all that, I would rate the factors as follows:\n\n- Criminal History: High\n- Age: High\n- Education: High\n- Living Situation: Medium (since he's not living alone but has held jobs)\n- Substance Use: Medium\n- Religiosity: Low\n\nTaking into account the combined effect of these factors, it seems like there is a moderate to high likelihood of recidivism. However, without knowing more about his current mental state or support systems, it's a bit tricky, but based on the given factors, I would lean towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
