    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each of their characteristics one by one and assign a weight to them based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst off, they're a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. From the examples, age seems to play a role where younger individuals might have higher risk factors, but it also depends on other aspects like criminal history and environment. So I'd say age is probably a medium factor because being 22 isn't extremely high or low in terms of recidivism.\n\nNext, they've been arrested once and convicted. Having a prior conviction definitely increases the likelihood of rearrest. Looking at the examples, those with more arrests and convictions had higher chances. So this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nTheir height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight is 178 lbs. I don't see any direct correlation between height or weight and recidivism in the provided data, so maybe these are low factors because they don't seem to influence behavior much.\n\nThey've never been married and are living alone now. Living alone might be neutral or even a positive factor if it means they have more structure, but I'm not sure. In the examples, being single didn't stand out as a major factor either way, so perhaps this is medium.\n\nHaving a GED certificate suggests some level of education, which could be a protective factor. From the examples, those with higher educational attainment had lower chances of rearrest, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nThey're not enrolled in college and haven't held any jobs this year. Not having a job or being in school can be risky because it might indicate instability or fewer resources. In the examples, job stability was a positive factor, so not having one could be medium to high.\n\nThey've used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use itself isn't explicitly tied to recidivism without more context like frequency or severity. But since they haven't been using recently and don't feel depressed, maybe this is low. However, considering that substance abuse can contribute, it might still be medium.\n\nThey lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Living in a large urban household could mean more social influences or stressors, which might increase recidivism risk. From the examples, living situations influenced outcomes, so this is probably a high factor.\n\nLastly, they believe that God has something to do with their life events. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, but it's unclear how this ties into criminal behavior. It doesn't seem directly related, so maybe low.\n\nPutting all these together: prior conviction (high), living situation (high), education (low), employment (medium), substance use (medium), and age (medium). The highest factors are the prior conviction and their living situation, both high. So I think they have a 70% chance of being rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22, which is within the young adult range, moderately increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"One arrest and conviction significantly elevate the likelihood of future rearrest\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might be neutral or slightly protective, but it's not a major factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED may indicate some stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No job and not enrolled in college can indicate instability, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use could be a risk factor, though it's moderate here\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Urban household without biological parents may expose to higher stressors\"),\n    (\"religion_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Beliefs about God's influence don't directly tie to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
