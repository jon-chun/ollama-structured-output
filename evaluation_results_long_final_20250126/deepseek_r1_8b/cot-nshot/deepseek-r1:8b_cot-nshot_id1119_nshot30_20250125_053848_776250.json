    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. I'm going to go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight based on what I've learned from the previous examples.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Looking at the past cases, younger individuals, like 18 or 19, had higher recidivism rates. So, being 22 might be lower than those but still medium because he's still in the younger adult range where recidivism is more common.\n\nNext, he identifies as Black. From the examples, Black individuals had mixed outcomes, but those with higher numbers of arrests were more likely to reoffend. Since he's been arrested six times, that's a high number, so this factor should be weighted high.\n\nHe's never been convicted, which is positive. In the previous data, non-conviction didn't directly correlate with recidivism, but it might indicate he hasn't had the same consequences pushing him to reoffend as others have.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs., which isn't particularly low or high. The examples didn't show a strong link between weight and recidivism, so I'll consider this a low factor since it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors, but without more context, it's hard to say. From the examples, being single or not didn't always predict recidivism, so maybe medium.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. In past cases, education levels were significant. Lower education usually means higher recidivism rates, so this should be weighted high because without education, he might find it harder to stay employed or avoid crime.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without income, people often turn to criminal activities for money, so this factor is definitely high.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and is currently feeling down. Drug use is a major factor. From examples, substance abuse was consistently linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if he's currently experiencing depression or low mood. This should be weighted very high.\n\nHe feels down all the time, which is significant. Mental health issues contribute to criminal behavior. Feeling constantly sad or discouraged can lead to more antisocial actions, so this factor is also high.\n\nHe comes from a household of size 4. Family structure can influence behavior. Larger families might provide more support, but in some cases, chaos at home increases delinquency. It's a medium factor because it's not as directly linked as others but still relevant.\n\nLastly, he believes God has control over his fate. Religiosity or belief systems can influence behavior. If he finds solace in religion, it might lower recidivism, so this could be a low factor since it might help him avoid crime.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks are: multiple arrests (high), substance abuse and current mood issues (very high), unemployment (high), lack of education (high). These combine to make his likelihood of rearrest quite high. The other factors like age, living alone, family size, and belief system are lower but still contribute.\n\nSo, I'd say the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence around 75% based on these weighted factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, younger adult increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals showed higher recidivism rates in examples\"),\n    (\"no_convictions\", \"low\", \"Non-conviction doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight not significantly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be risk factor but context needed\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education strongly linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"very_high\", \"Recent drug use and current mood issues are major risks\"),\n    (\"mood\", \"very_high\", \"Depression increases antisocial behavior risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger household might offer support but not directly linked\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may reduce recidivism through solace\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
