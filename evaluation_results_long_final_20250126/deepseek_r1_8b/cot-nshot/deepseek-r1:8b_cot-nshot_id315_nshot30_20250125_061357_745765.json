    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine the likelihood of this individual being rearrested within the next three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 21 years old. Typically, younger individuals have higher recidivism rates compared to older adults. So, this is a medium risk.\n\n2. **Arrest and Conviction History**: He has been arrested twice and convicted. A history of convictions significantly increases the likelihood of future rearrests. This factor is high risk.\n\n3. **Employment Status**: He's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but since he hasn't completed any college education, this might not counterbalance his criminal history as much. It's medium risk here.\n\n4. **Substance Abuse History**: He used marijuana recently. Substance abuse is a known contributor to recidivism, so this is high risk.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: He didn't mention any issues, but feeling down or being depressed could affect behavior. However, without specific information, it's hard to assess, so maybe low risk here.\n\n6. **Family Dynamics**: Growing up in a household of four with both parents present might provide some support, which is positive. This is medium risk.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs**: He considers God influential in his life, potentially providing a sense of structure and deterrence from criminal behavior. This is low risk.\n\n8. **Current Living Situation**: Living alone at 21 might expose him to more negative influences or make it harder to stay engaged in positive activities. Medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: His criminal history, substance abuse, and past arrests are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like employment and family support reduce the likelihood slightly, his extensive arrest record is a dominant factor. So overall, he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Convictions and arrests correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism but limited impact here\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Substance use significantly raises rearrest likelihood\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No direct info, lower impact\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Supportive family reduces risk, minor effect\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Potential deterrent effect, minimal influence here\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may pose risks, moderate impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
