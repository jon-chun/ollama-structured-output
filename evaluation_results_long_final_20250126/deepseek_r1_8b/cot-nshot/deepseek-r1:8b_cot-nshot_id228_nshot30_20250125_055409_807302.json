    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their characteristics one by one and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, they have been arrested four times and convicted. That's pretty high compared to some others who had fewer arrests. So I think that's a strong indicator, maybe medium or high.\n\nThey are 18 years old, which is a young age associated with higher recidivism rates. That seems like a significant factor, so probably high weight.\n\nThey weigh 170 lbs and are living alone now. I don't know if being of average build affects recidivism much compared to other factors like criminal history or substance use. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Solitary living might not directly correlate with rearrest, but it could mean he's more likely to engage in risky behavior without supervision. I think that might be a medium factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism, so lacking an education would be a significant risk. That should probably be a high weight.\n\nHe held two jobs this year, which suggests he's trying to support himself. Stable employment can reduce criminal behavior, but having only two jobs might not be enough. Maybe medium or low.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a well-known predictor of rearrest. Since it's marijuana, maybe less severe than other drugs, but still significant. Probably high weight.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which means he's currently mentally stable. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so if he's not currently depressed, that might lower the risk. So perhaps low or medium.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size three growing up. Family structure can influence behavior. A larger family might provide more support or supervision, which could reduce recidivism. Maybe medium weight.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity or spiritual beliefs can sometimes deter criminal behavior. If he finds purpose through religion, that might lower his risk. So perhaps low or medium.\n\nNow, compiling all these:\n\n- Criminal history: High\n- Age: High\n- Employment: Medium\n- Education: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Mental health: Low\n- Family structure: Medium\n- Religion: Low\n\nEach of these factors contributes to the likelihood of rearrest. The highest weights are criminal history, age, education, and drug use. These seem like the most influential factors.\n\nSo for prediction, I think it's more likely he will be rearrested within three years. Confidence is around 70% based on the weight of these high factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
