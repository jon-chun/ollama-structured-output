    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their factors one by one.\n\nFirst, age: 22 years old. From the examples, younger people seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates, especially around that age when they're more impulsive or perhaps facing more challenges. So I'd say this is a medium risk factor because as a young adult, they might be more prone to making bad decisions.\n\nNext, race: White male. Looking at the examples, it seems like being White isn't inherently a higher risk, but factors like prior convictions and other aspects play a bigger role. So maybe this is a low risk factor since race alone doesn't seem to determine much here.\n\nPrevious arrests and convictions: He's been arrested once and convicted. The examples show that even one conviction can significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism. For instance, someone with just one arrest in the examples often had higher chances. So this might be a high risk factor because a prior conviction shows they've already been in trouble.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'2\" and 120 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical size affects recidivism, but from the examples, it doesn't seem like these factors alone are major contributors. Maybe this is low risk since there's no clear link to criminal behavior.\n\nMarital status: Never been married. In some cases, being single might correlate with higher risks due to lack of support or accountability. But in other examples, it didn't stand out much. I'll go with medium risk here because it could be a contributing factor but isn't the main determinant.\n\nLiving situation: Currently not living alone. Sharing a place might provide more structure or supervision, which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education tends to lower recidivism rates because it provides better opportunities and coping mechanisms. This seems like a strong protective factor, so I'll rate this as low risk for recidivism.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Having a job can stabilize someone's life, reducing the chances of getting into trouble. So this is another positive factor, making it a low risk.\n\nDrug use: No history in the past four years. Not using drugs significantly lowers the likelihood of criminal behavior, so this is definitely a low risk factor.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression or other mental health issues can contribute to criminal activity, but since he's not reporting it now, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHousehold structure at a young age: Lived with his mother in an urban area. Growing up in a supportive environment can buffer against delinquency. So this is another positive factor, making it a low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't think God affects him. Religiosity can be a protective factor, but since he doesn't see it that way, maybe it's less effective here. Still, without evidence of it being problematic, I'll consider this a low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are low or medium, but the prior conviction stands out as high risk because it directly ties to recidivism. Even though some other factors might lower the risk, the prior arrest is a significant indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age can increase the likelihood of impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not significantly predict recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Conviction indicates a history of legal trouble, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not being married may increase risk due to lack of support\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others can provide structure, reducing recidivism chances\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education generally lowers recidivism through better opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held a job, which can stabilize life and reduce criminal activity\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug history significantly lowers recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate lower mental health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"household_structure\", \"low\", \"Supportive upbringing can buffer against delinquency\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief does not inherently increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
