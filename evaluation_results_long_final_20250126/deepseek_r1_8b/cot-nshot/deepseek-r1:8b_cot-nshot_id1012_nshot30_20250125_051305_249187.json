    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, older individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own. I'll consider this as medium risk because being an adult might increase likelihood, but there are other factors too.\n\nNext, race: she's Black. In the examples, Black individuals had mixed outcomes, but I notice that those with more severe charges or multiple arrests were more likely to recast. So, her race itself isn't a direct indicator, but combined with other factors, it might contribute.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. From the examples, having a prior conviction seems like a significant factor. People with criminal history often have higher rates of reoffending, so I'll give this a high weight because past behavior predicts future behavior.\n\nHer current charge isn't specified beyond being related to drugs (marijuana and cocaine). The use of multiple substances suggests a more severe addiction or dependency issue, which can be a strong indicator of recidivism. So, substance abuse is definitely a high risk factor here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Being single doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, but living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase risks. This is probably a medium risk factor because it's more about social circumstances than direct criminal history.\n\nEducation: she lacks a high school diploma or GED. Education is a strong predictor of future success and lower crime rates. Without education, individuals often struggle to find stable employment or address underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior. I'll assign this as a high risk factor because it's a significant barrier.\n\nEmployment: she has held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to higher crime rates as people may feel compelled to engage in illegal activities for income. This is another high risk factor because consistent employment is protective against recidivism.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana and cocaine recently. Current substance abuse is a major indicator of potential reoffending. High weight here because active addiction can drive further criminal behavior.\n\nMental health isn't explicitly mentioned, but her feelings of sadness and hopelessness are noted. Mental health issues are known to contribute to recidivism. Without specific information, I'll consider this a medium risk factor as it's a known contributing factor but not the primary issue here.\n\nFamily background: she lived with her mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and family instability may contribute to criminal behavior. This is likely a medium risk factor because while it's a stressor, other factors like substance abuse are more directly related to recidivism.\n\nReligious beliefs: she considers God in her personal life. Religion can provide moral support and reduce criminal behavior. This might lower the likelihood of recidivism, so I'll give this a low weight as it could act as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, substance abuse, lack of education, unemployment, and prior conviction are the strongest factors. These often work together to increase the likelihood of further arrests. The presence of mental health issues adds some risk, but not as much as the others. Religious beliefs might help mitigate some of that risk. \n\nSo, considering these weights: high for substance abuse, lack of education, unemployment, and prior conviction; medium for age, race, mental health, and family; low for religious beliefs. The combined impact is likely to lead to a rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Older individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to accumulated issues\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Race itself isn't directly indicative, but combined with other factors it can contribute\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Prior conviction is a strong indicator of future behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Current drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Single and living alone may increase risks through lack of support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education is a significant barrier to successful reintegration\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Unemployment can lead to higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Mental health issues contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Urban environment and family instability may increase risks\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
