    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions and more exposure to criminal influences. So I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, race/ethnicity: he's Black. Looking at the examples, Black individuals had mixed outcomes. Some had higher recidivism, others didn't. It doesn't seem as straightforward, but I'll note it as medium because it might influence systemic factors but isn't determinative on its own.\n\nArrest history: he's been arrested twice and convicted once. From the data, those with more arrests or convictions had higher rates. Since he has two arrests and one conviction, this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 152 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stature affects recidivism, but maybe being taller or within a average weight range doesn't pose significant risks either way. So I'll consider this as low.\n\nMarital status: never been married. In the examples, being single didn't seem to correlate with higher recidivism. Some had been married and others not, but it didn't stand out as a factor. So this is probably low.\n\nLiving situation: currently living alone. From the data, living alone doesn't seem to impact recidivism much either way. So I'll assign this a low risk.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma. Having an education might reduce recidivism because it provides more opportunities and structure. This could be a protective factor, so I think this is medium in terms of reducing risk.\n\nEmployment: held one job this year. Being employed can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior as it provides stability. So this is another protective factor, likely medium.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana recently. Drug use, especially among young offenders, is often linked to higher recidivism. He has used marijuana in the past four years, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed recently. The examples didn't mention mental health directly, but being mentally unstable can increase criminal behavior. Since he's not feeling depressed now, it might not be an immediate factor, but I'm unsure how to weight this. Maybe low.\n\nFamily background: lived with his mother in a household of five. Growing up in larger families doesn't seem to have a consistent impact. Some examples had big families, others didn't. So I'll consider this as low.\n\nReligious beliefs: he considers God has something to do with his life. Religion can be a protective factor by providing moral support and structured behavior. This could reduce recidivism, so it's medium in terms of reducing risk.\n\nPutting all these together:\n\n1. Age - High\n2. Race - Medium\n3. Arrest History - High\n4. Physical Factors - Low\n5. Marital Status - Low\n6. Living Situation - Low\n7. Education - Medium (protective)\n8. Employment - Medium (protective)\n9. Drug Use - High\n10. Mental Health - Low (since he's not depressed now)\n11. Family Background - Low\n12. Religion - Medium (protective)\n\nI think the highest risks are age, arrest history, and drug use. Those three are all high factors that significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"physical_factors\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
