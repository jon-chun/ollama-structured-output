    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case and assign weights to each risk factor based on the examples provided. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 20 years old. From the previous examples, younger ages seem to have higher recidivism rates. For instance, an 18-year-old had high recidivism with many arrests and convictions. So, age is a significant factor here. I'll assign this a high weight.\n\n2. **Race**: Hispanic. The examples show that race can influence outcomes, but it's not clear if being Hispanic specifically increases risk more than other races. However, since the person identifies as Hispanic, it might contribute to higher recidivism rates similar to other minorities. Medium weight.\n\n3. **Number of Arrests and Convictions**: He has been arrested 4 times and convicted. The examples indicate that a higher number of arrests and convictions significantly increases the risk. For example, someone with 17 arrests had high recidivism. This is a critical factor. High weight.\n\n4. **Employment Status**: Unemployed. From the examples, unemployment seems to correlate with higher recidivism rates. Without stable employment, it's harder to reintegrate into society, leading to more crimes. Medium weight.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Never been married. Being unmarried can contribute to higher recidivism as studies suggest it may lead to more criminal behavior due to lack of social ties and support. Medium weight.\n\n6. **Education Level**: Doesn't have a diploma or GED. Education is linked to lower recidivism. Without education, it's harder to find jobs and reintegrate, increasing the likelihood of further arrests. High weight.\n\n7. **Substance Abuse History**: He has used marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism. The examples show frequent drug use leading to higher arrest rates. High weight.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: He feels down most of the time, indicating potential depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can lead to criminal behavior as they may impair judgment and increase stress. Medium weight.\n\n9. **Family Structure at Young Age**: Lived with both parents in a household of 6. While large families might provide more support, the person's current situation is living alone, which could be stressful. However, having both parents might have provided better support than not. But since he's now alone, it might contribute to higher recidivism indirectly due to lack of support. Medium weight.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs**: He considers God has something to do with his life. Religion can sometimes be a protective factor but may also lead to stricter moral codes that could influence behavior. However, without more info on how religion impacts his choices, it's hard to assess. Low weight.\n\nNow, I'll assign the weights based on these considerations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_structure_young_age\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
