    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their characteristics one by one and see how they might contribute to that likelihood.\n\nFirst off, age is 22. From the examples provided, it seems like younger individuals have a higher chance of recidivism because they're still developing and might not have as much stability yet. So I think age would be a high risk factor here.\n\nNext, race. The person identifies as White. In the examples given, both Black and White individuals had varying outcomes, but there's no clear pattern that makes one more likely than the other. So maybe race isn't as significant a factor here.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested 6 times and convicted. That's a lot of prior run-ins with the law, which definitely points towards a higher likelihood of being rearrested again. This seems like a very high risk factor because repeated criminal behavior is often indicative of continued issues.\n\nCurrent legal status: He hasn't been married and is living alone now, but previously had some issues. However, his arrest history suggests that he's already been through the legal system before, which could mean he knows how to navigate around it or has a pattern of not adhering to laws, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nEmployment: He held 2 jobs in the past year. Having employment can sometimes indicate stability, but given his arrest history, maybe that's more of a challenge for him, like holding short-term or inconsistent jobs. This could actually increase his risk if he's not able to maintain steady work, which might contribute to further issues.\n\nEducation: He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag because it limits job opportunities and can lead to more involvement in criminal activities as a means of survival or past bad influences. So this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nSubstance abuse: He used marijuana in the past four years, which is a significant factor. Substance abuse often goes hand-in-hand with criminal behavior, so this could be a medium to high risk depending on how severe his use is and whether he's seeking help now or not. Since it's mentioned as something he has done recently, it might still pose a risk.\n\nMental health: He felt down sometimes in the past month, which suggests possible mental health issues. This can lead to higher chances of criminal behavior if not addressed. So this could be another medium to high risk factor.\n\nHousehold background: He lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and may expose individuals to more negative influences, which can contribute to criminal behavior. So this is probably a medium to high risk factor depending on how stable that environment was.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with what happens to him. This might indicate he has some moral framework or faith, which could help in reducing recidivism by providing a reason to behave better. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together, the most significant factors are his extensive arrest history (6 times), lack of education, substance abuse, and current mental health issues. These high-weighted factors make me lean towards him being rearrested again within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age increases the likelihood of impulsive decisions and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not significantly affect recidivism in this case, as both White and Black individuals have varying outcomes.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Extensive arrest history indicates a pattern of lawbreaking behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Past employment suggests some stability but given his legal issues, it may not be sufficient\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and can lead to criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues, if untreated, increase the likelihood of continued criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and possible exposure to negative influences contribute to higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Faith may provide moral support, reducing recidivism risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
