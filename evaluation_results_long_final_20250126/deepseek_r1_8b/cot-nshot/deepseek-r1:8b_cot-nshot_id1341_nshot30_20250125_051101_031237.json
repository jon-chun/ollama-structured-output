    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this recidivism prediction problem step by step. The case is a 21-year-old Hispanic woman who has been arrested five times and convicted. She's married but living alone now. Let me go through each risk factor one by one to determine their weights.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21 years old, which is considered an adult and likely more set in her ways, increasing the probability of further arrests. I'll assign this a medium weight because while it's a factor, it might not be as significant as others like criminal history.\n\nCriminal history: She has been arrested five times and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that could lead to future rearrests. This seems high, so I'll give it a high weight since prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nMarital status: She's married but living alone. While marriage can sometimes be protective, her current living situation might be strained, which could increase stress and likelihood of criminal behavior. However, without more context, this factor is medium-weighted.\n\nEmployment: She held two jobs last year. Employment is generally a positive indicator as it provides structure and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This should have a low weight because having a job is a protective factor.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs in four years. Abstinence from drugs can reduce criminal behavior, especially if drug use was previously linked to her arrests. A high weight makes sense here as this could significantly lower the chance of rearrest.\n\nMental health: The case doesn't mention any issues, but even without depression or anxiety, lack of mental health support can sometimes contribute. Without specifics, I'll assign a low weight because it's not explicitly mentioned.\n\nLiving situation: She lived with her biological mother in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, and family dynamics can influence behavior. This is medium-weighted as it's a contextual factor but might not be the most significant alone.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God doesn't affect her life. Religion can provide moral support and reduce criminal behavior. A low weight here because without active religious involvement, its effect is unclear.\n\nPutting it all together, her extensive criminal history and recent abstinence from drugs are high-weight factors. Other factors like age, employment, living situation, and religion are medium or low. Her current marital status might not have a huge impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: She is an adult, which increases the likelihood of criminal behavior becoming a habit\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern likely to repeat\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Marriage can sometimes be protective, but her current living situation may be strained\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding two jobs suggests stability that could reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Abstinence from drugs can lower criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No mention of issues, but lack of support might still affect behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Urban background and family dynamics may influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in God's absence may not provide enough moral support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
