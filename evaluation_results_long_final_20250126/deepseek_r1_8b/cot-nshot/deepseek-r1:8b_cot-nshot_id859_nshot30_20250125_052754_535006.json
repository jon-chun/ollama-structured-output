    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old White female will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of her risk factors one by one and assign a weight based on what I've learned from the previous examples.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. From the examples, it seems that a history of arrest or conviction carries some weight. Looking at example 30, someone with multiple arrests and convictions was considered high risk. Since she has a prior conviction, this might be a medium factor because having one doesn't always predict recidivism on its own.\n\nHer age is 22. The examples show that younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates. For instance, in example 27, an 18-year-old had several high-risk factors but was still considered NO. So maybe her age is a medium factor since she's not extremely young but hasn't reached the mid-to-late twenties yet.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. From the examples, stable family environments seem to reduce recidivism risk. In example 22, someone in a stable relationship was less likely to reoffend, so this could be a low factor because having a supportive home life might provide better support and structure.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a big factor; lacking education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. In example 27, lack of education was a significant factor but the outcome was NO. However, since she's not working either, this might be a medium-high risk because without education and employment, she's less likely to have positive outlets.\n\nShe has held only one job this year. Employment is another key factor. Having a job can provide structure and income, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. Since she hasn't held many jobs or isn't working now, this might be a medium risk because some work history is better than none, but not enough to significantly lower the risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Sobriety and mental health can greatly influence recidivism. The examples show that substance use often leads to rearrests, so her abstinence could be a low factor since she's addressing one high-risk area.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a household of size six in rural area. Family structure and upbringing play roles here. Having both parents is positive, but a large household might mean less individual attention, which could be either medium or low. From examples, stable family environments are usually low risk, so I'll lean towards low.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religiosity can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates as it provides a sense of purpose and structure. This might be a low factor because believing in a higher power can influence behavior positively.\n\nPutting all these together: prior conviction (medium), age (medium), stable family (low), education (medium-high), employment (medium), sobriety (low), family background (low), religiosity (low). So the highest risk factors are education and employment, which I'll weight as medium-high for education and medium for employment. The rest are either low or medium.\n\nSo, assigning weights:\n- Prior conviction: medium\n- Age: medium\n- Education: medium-high\n- Employment: medium\n- Sobriety: low\n- Family background: low\n- Religiosity: low\n\nNow, considering all these factors, her overall risk seems moderate. She has some high-risk factors like lack of education and a prior conviction but also has protective factors like sobriety, family support, and religiosity.\n\nBased on the examples, someone with multiple medium-high risks might tip towards YES, especially if there's a prior conviction. So I'm leaning towards predicting \"YES\" with a confidence around 60% because while she has some protective factors, her lack of education and previous conviction are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having a criminal history increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less decision-making experience\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium_high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Employment provides structure and reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"sobriety\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use can support better decision-making\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a large household may provide stability\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can contribute to positive behavioral changes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
