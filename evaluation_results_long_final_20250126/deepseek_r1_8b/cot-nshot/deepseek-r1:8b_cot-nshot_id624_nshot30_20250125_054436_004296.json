    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested in the next three years. I'm going to go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on how it might influence recidivism.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From what I know, younger people, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are more likely to have higher rates of recidivism because they might not have as much accountability or structured life plans. So, I think this factor is probably a high risk.\n\nNext, arrest history: he's been arrested 6 times but hasn't been convicted. This suggests he has a history of getting into trouble, which could indicate a pattern that's hard to break unless there's intervention. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe he's been lucky or had lenient sentences, but the fact that he keeps getting arrested is concerning. I'll consider this as high risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and contribute to criminal behavior as people with fewer resources might turn to illegal activities for income or status. This factor seems like it's medium to high risk.\n\nHe's living alone now but hasn't been married, which might mean he lacks strong social support systems that could help him stay out of trouble. Being alone can sometimes lead to more risky behaviors because there's no one to check in on you or hold you accountable. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has held no jobs this year, which is another red flag. Not having work can mean less stability and more time for engaging in criminal activities. This should be high risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While substance use is definitely a risk factor, especially for crimes related to drugs, his current mental state isn't showing signs of depression, which might mitigate some risks. Still, the fact that he's using drugs is significant enough to be considered high risk.\n\nHe was raised in a household of size 10 in a rural area. Growing up in a large family might mean there were more opportunities for exposure to criminal influences or less supervision. Also, rural areas sometimes have different crime rates compared to urban areas, which could be medium risk.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Religiosity can play a role in reducing recidivism as it often provides moral support and community ties. Without that, he might lack some protective factors, making this another high risk factor.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most concerning factors are age, arrest history, lack of education, no job, substance use, large family size, and lack of religious beliefs. Each of these contributes significantly to recidivism risks. While his current mental state isn't showing depression, the other factors are strong indicators that he's at a high risk for being rearrested in three years.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think each factor is either medium or high, with some overlapping heavily. Given the combination, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to have higher rates of recidivism due to lack of accountability and structured life plans.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Six arrests indicate a pattern of trouble, which is concerning even without convictions.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No jobs this year means less stability and more time for illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is a significant risk factor, especially for drug-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Large household size in rural areas may expose him to more criminal influences.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Lack of religiosity can remove a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
