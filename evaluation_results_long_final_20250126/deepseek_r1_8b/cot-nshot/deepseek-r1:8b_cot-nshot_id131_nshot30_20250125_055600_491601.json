    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine the likelihood of this individual being rearrested within the next three years based on the given risk factors. First, I'll go through each factor one by one and assess its weight as low, medium, or high.\n\nStarting with age: The person is 20 years old, which is a common age for higher risk behaviors, so I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, racial identity: He identifies as Black. From the examples, being Black seems to correlate with higher recidivism rates, so that's also a medium factor.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested 3 times and convicted. A significant number of arrests indicates a pattern, so this is high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: He\u2019s 5'8\" and 156 lbs. While not directly related to criminal behavior, being taller can sometimes be a protective factor, but since he's also at a higher weight, it might contribute to health issues that could lead to further problems, so I'll give this a low weight.\n\nMarital status: He has never been married. Being single can sometimes increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, so I'll consider this medium.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone now, which might indicate some independence but could also mean he lacks supervision, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nEducation level: He doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism, so that's definitely high.\n\nEmployment status: He has held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to criminal behavior for lack of structure, so medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor contributing to criminal behavior and recidivism, so high weight.\n\nDepression indicators: He hasn't felt depressed recently. While depression can contribute to crime, not feeling down could be a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nHousehold structure as a child: Lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up without both parents might increase risks, but it's not the most critical factor, so medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God plays a role in his life. Religion can be a protective factor against crime, so low weight here.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest weighted factors are arrest history and education level, both high risk. The other factors like race, employment, and drug use also contribute significantly but are medium or high. I'll sum up the weights and compare them to previous examples to make a prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Text: Young age is often associated with higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Text: racial identity as Black is a known predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Text: multiple arrests and convictions indicate high recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Text: height and weight do not directly correlate to criminal behavior but may influence other factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Text: single status can increase engagement in risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Text: living alone may indicate lack of supervision, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Text: no diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Text: unemployment can lead to criminal behavior due to lack of structure\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Text: recent drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Text: no indicators of depression may be a protective factor\"),\n    (\"household_structure\", \"medium\", \"Text: growing up in a single-parent household is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Text: religious beliefs can be protective against crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
