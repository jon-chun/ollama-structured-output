    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White female will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of her factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 7 times and convicted, which is a strong indicator. Previous criminal history usually points towards higher recidivism. So that\u2019s probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe\u2019s 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. While height and weight don\u2019t directly correlate with crime rates, being in that weight range could be associated with certain behaviors, but I'm not sure if it's a significant factor here. Maybe medium or low.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more opportunities for criminal behavior since there might not be accountability partners. That might be a medium risk.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a high school diploma or GED, which is a big red flag. Lack of education often leads to more criminal activities as individuals struggle to find meaningful employment and get involved in more illegal activities. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe held only 1 job this year. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which might contribute to criminal behavior. So that\u2019s another medium or maybe high.\n\nShe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use itself isn\u2019t always a predictor of future crime, but combined with other factors like lack of education and prior arrests, it could increase the risk. Maybe medium to high.\n\nShe felt down during some months, indicating possible mental health issues. Depression or anxiety can lead to criminal behavior as individuals might cope negatively. That\u2019s probably a medium risk.\n\nShe lived with her mother in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in a single-parent household can have negative effects on behavior, but it's not always a guarantee. Maybe medium.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her outcomes seems like she might lack personal control and could rely on external factors, which might contribute to poor decisions. That\u2019s a bit tricky, but perhaps medium.\n\nPutting this all together: previous criminal history is the biggest factor\u2014high risk. Lack of education also high. Unstable employment medium-high. Drug use medium-high. Mental health issues medium. Living situation medium. Belief system medium.\n\nSo weighting them:\n\nPrevious convictions - High\n\nNo education - High\n\nJob instability - Medium-High\n\nDrug use - Medium-High\n\nMental health - Medium\n\nHousehold - Medium\n\nReligious belief - Medium\n\nOverall, the strongest factors are previous convictions and lack of education, which are both high. The others add some risk but not as much.\n\nSo prediction is \"YES\" she will be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_convictions\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"no_high_school\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"job_instability\", \"medium_high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium_high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
