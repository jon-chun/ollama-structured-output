    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. Maybe medium because they're still developing and might make poor decisions.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's a lot, indicating a history of criminal behavior. The examples with high numbers like 7 or 17 had \"YES\" outcomes. So this should be a high weight for arrest history.\n\nRace is Black. In the examples, Blacks had mixed results but more \"NO\" outcomes. Maybe medium since it might not directly correlate as strongly.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Single and living alone can increase risk due to lack of support and potential isolation. From examples, this seemed to lead to higher recidivism. So high weight for living situation.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Having education but not using it might indicate lower motivation or opportunities, increasing the risk. Maybe medium.\n\nHe held only 1 job last year. Unstable work can contribute to criminal behavior. Examples with fewer jobs had \"YES\" outcomes, so high weight for employment.\n\nHe used marijuana recently and felt down. Drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism. Also feeling depressed might increase the risk. High weight for substance use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his mom in an urban area. Urban environments can have more crime opportunities. Examples with urban living sometimes had \"YES\" outcomes. Maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God has control over his life. Religiosity didn't seem to factor much in examples but might provide support. If he relies on religion for guidance, maybe lower risk? Or vice versa. Not sure, so medium.\n\nCombining all these, the highest weights are arrest history, substance use, job instability, and living alone. These factors likely increase his chances of being rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"9 arrests and convictions indicate a high risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black race may contribute to increased likelihood based on example patterns\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Never married and living alone can increase criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate without further education may indicate lower motivation\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Only 1 job held last year suggests instability and higher risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and depression may lead to further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Lived with mother in urban area, which can provide more crime opportunities\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Believes God controls his life; unclear impact on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
