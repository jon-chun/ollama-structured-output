    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on what I've learned from the previous examples.\n\nFirst, age: He's 19. From the examples, younger people seem to have higher recidivism rates. Maybe because they're less experienced or more impulsive. So, this might be a high risk factor.\n\nNext, number of arrests and convictions: He has been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, someone with one arrest was considered medium risk, but others with more had higher risks. So, maybe medium here because he's only got one so far, but it resulted in a conviction which could indicate higher likelihood.\n\nHis weight is between 175-199 lbs. I'm not sure how weight directly correlates to recidivism, but in the examples, being heavier didn't seem to have a clear pattern. Maybe it's a low risk factor since it doesn't strongly predict behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. From previous cases, living alone might mean more access to negative influences or less supervision. So that could be medium risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a big predictor; without it, people often struggle more, leading to higher recidivism. This should definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job this year. employment can be a stabilizing factor. One job might not be enough, so maybe medium risk here because he's not established in the workforce.\n\nHe has used marijuana recently. Drug use is a significant factor. In the examples, drug use often led to higher recidivism rates, especially if there's a history of convictions. So this should be high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but without current problems, maybe lower risk here.\n\nHe lived with his mother in an 8-person household. Family structure can influence behavior; larger households might provide more supervision or chaos. I'm not sure, but it might not be as impactful as other factors like education or employment. Maybe low risk.\n\nFinally, he believes in something higher (religion). Belief systems can influence behavior, but without specific info on how this affects recidivism, it's hard to judge. Perhaps medium risk because it could provide moral constraints.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are lack of education and current drug use, each likely high. The others like age, employment, and family might be medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age is often linked to higher recidivism due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"single arrest leading to conviction indicates some risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"living alone may lead to more exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"holding one job might not provide enough stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"current drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health_depression\", \"low\", \"no current depression noted\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"large household may provide more supervision or chaos\"),\n    (\"religion_or_belief_system\", \"medium\", \"belief system might offer moral constraints\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
