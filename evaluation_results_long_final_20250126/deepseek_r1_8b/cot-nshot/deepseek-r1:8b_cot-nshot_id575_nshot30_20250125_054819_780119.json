    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. From the examples given, age seems to play a role, but it's not clear if younger people are more likely to reoffend or if older individuals have better odds due to greater responsibility. I think age might be a medium risk factor since younger adults can still make poor decisions, but they might also be more motivated to change.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, those with prior arrests, especially without a conviction, sometimes have lower recidivism rates because they haven't been formally charged or sentenced yet. But an arrest record itself can indicate higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history. I might weight this as medium.\n\nHis physical build is 5'9\" and 143 lbs. From the examples, taller and heavier individuals sometimes had higher risks, but it's not a consistent factor. It seems more about behavior than physical size. Maybe this isn't a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is currently not living alone. Living arrangements can affect decision-making and access to resources. Being single might mean he has fewer ties or accountability, possibly increasing risk. So maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is a strong indicator of reduced recidivism. Those with higher education are less likely to reoffend, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs this year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. High job stability is a good sign, so medium-low risk here.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and isn't depressed now. Lack of substance use and mental health issues are significant protective factors. Not using drugs and not feeling down are strong indicators, so low risk.\n\nAt 21, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Family dynamics and environment play a role. Growing up in a single-parent home might have some risks, but urban areas can also expose individuals to more stressors. Maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him. Religiosity or spiritual beliefs can influence behavior. If he finds purpose or structure through religion, that could reduce recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either low or medium. The only higher might be the prior arrest record, but since it's just one and no conviction, it's not extremely high. Overall, I think the risk is medium-low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age contributes to decision-making but can also indicate motivation for change\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate some risk but not as high as multiple convictions\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical size doesn't directly correlate with recidivism behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Single and not living alone might increase access to poor choices\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and further education are strong protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs indicate stability but may not negate other risks entirely\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a significant protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed and maintaining mental health can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with single parent may pose some risks\"),\n    (\"religion_or_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in higher power can provide structure and purpose\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
