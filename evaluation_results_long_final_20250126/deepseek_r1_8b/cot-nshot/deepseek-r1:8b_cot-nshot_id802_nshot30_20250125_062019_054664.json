    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each of his characteristics one by one and assigning a weight to them based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, it seems that an arrest without a conviction is a bit of a neutral factor or maybe slightly negative since it shows some history of involvement with the legal system. I think this might be a medium risk because it indicates some prior issues but isn't as severe as multiple convictions.\n\nNext, he's 19 years old. From the examples, younger age seems to correlate with higher recidivism risk. For instance, in example 27, an 18-year-old had several other high-risk factors and was predicted a \"NO\" outcome, but his age might have contributed. So I'll consider this as medium because he's a teenager, which is a common age for higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe identifies as White. In the examples, race didn't seem to directly influence the prediction, so maybe it doesn't add much weight here. I'll go with low since it doesn't contribute significantly.\n\nHe's living alone now. From example 27 again, living alone without family support might increase the risk, but in this case, he has a stable living situation on his own, which could reduce some risks compared to being in unstable environments. So maybe medium for having a stable home life.\n\nHe has a high school diploma, which is positive. In the examples, education was sometimes a protective factor, so I'll give it a low weight since it's a positive indicator.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's at risk; many people don't go to college and still lead stable lives. So maybe low here because having an education isn't directly linked to criminal behavior unless other factors are involved.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Having employment is generally a positive factor as it indicates responsibility, so I'll assign a low weight since job stability can reduce recidivism risk.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a determining factor; some people use drugs without engaging in criminal behavior. But given that he's been arrested once, it might indicate higher risk. So medium because substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe feels down sometimes, which could be related to mental health issues. From example 27, having feelings of being down was considered a risk factor. However, without more information on whether it's a diagnosed issue or just occasional feelings, I'll give it a low weight unless it's severe.\n\nHe has been living with both parents in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and may expose individuals to more risks. Also, having supportive parents might mitigate some risks. So maybe medium because of the urban environment but also because he's still living with his parents which could provide support.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his life. Religiosity can be a protective factor, so if he doesn't have any religious beliefs or practices, it might increase his risk compared to someone who does. So I'll give this a medium weight since lack of religious involvement is a known risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks seem to be related to substance abuse and possibly mental health issues. His job stability and education are positives, which might reduce the overall risk. But with an arrest history and substance use, it's moderate. I think there's a medium likelihood he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"Indicates prior legal involvement\"),\n    (\"Age (19)\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age may increase risk\"),\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"low\", \"Race does not significantly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Stable living can mitigate some risks\"),\n    (\"Education (High School Diploma)\", \"low\", \"Positive indicator of stability\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"low\", \"Job stability is protective\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse (Drugs)\", \"high\", \"Significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (down feelings)\", \"low\", \"Potential but unclear impact\"),\n    (\"Family (both parents)\", \"medium\", \"Support may mitigate risks\"),\n    (\"Religiosity (no belief in God)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religion can increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
