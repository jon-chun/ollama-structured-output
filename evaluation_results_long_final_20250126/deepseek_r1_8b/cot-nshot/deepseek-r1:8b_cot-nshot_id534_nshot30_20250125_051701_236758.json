    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 20-year-old Black male will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of his characteristics one by one and assign a weight to them based on what I know from the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. I remember in some cases, an arrest without a conviction didn't necessarily predict recidivism as strongly as a criminal history. So maybe that's a lower risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. The examples don't really talk about physical build affecting recidivism, so I'm not sure how to weight this. It might be low since it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. From the examples, being single or having a stable living situation didn't seem to have a strong correlation with recidivism either. So maybe that's another low factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having an education level of high school might be a positive factor, suggesting he has some stability. But not being in college could mean he's not as motivated or structured, so it's a bit conflicting. I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nHe held two jobs this year. Employment is generally seen as a positive indicator because it suggests he has a routine and responsibilities. This could reduce the likelihood of recidivism, so I'll assign high weight here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't necessarily predictive of future behavior, but the examples often linked drug use to higher recidivism. However, he hasn't been using other substances like cocaine or has more severe issues. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe felt down sometimes and had low spirits recently. Depression or emotional issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a two-parent household is generally better for children's development compared to single-parent or unstable environments. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his life. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior by providing moral support and structure. That's another low risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest weighted factors are employment (high) and recent emotional issues (high). The next highest is drug use (medium), followed by education level (medium), household background (low), and religious beliefs (low).\n\nSo overall, there are significant positive factors like employment and protective ones like religion, but he's dealing with some high-risk factors like emotional struggles and substance use. It might balance out, leaning towards a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest record\", \"low\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, which is less impactful than a conviction history\"),\n    (\"Physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive but not enrolled in college might indicate lack of further stability\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs, which is a strong indicator of stability and reduced risk\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana is less severe than other substances but still a concern\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Feelings of being down indicate possible emotional instability and higher risk\"),\n    (\"Household background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a two-parent household is generally protective\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
