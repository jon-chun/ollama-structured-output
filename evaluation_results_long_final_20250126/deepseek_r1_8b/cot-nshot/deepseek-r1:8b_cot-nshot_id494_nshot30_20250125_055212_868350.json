    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. I'll start by going through each factor one by one and assigning a weight based on what I know from previous examples.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates. So, I might consider this a high risk factor.\n\nNext, race: he's White. Looking at the past data, White individuals had outcomes split between YES and NO, but it doesn't consistently show a higher or lower rate. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested once and convicted. From previous cases, even one arrest can be significant. So this might be a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: He's 5'8\" and 144 lbs. I don't see a direct correlation in the examples between physical stats and recidivism, so probably low or medium. Maybe low here since it doesn't seem impactful.\n\nMarital status: Never married. In the examples, being single didn't consistently predict recidivism either way, but sometimes single individuals had higher rates. Maybe medium weight.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone now. From past data, living alone didn't show a clear pattern, so maybe low weight here.\n\nEducation: He has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. The presence of a GED was sometimes protective but not always. Maybe medium weight since it indicates some education but no furthering.\n\nEmployment: He held 4 jobs this year. Higher employment can be protective, suggesting he's more stable. So, I might give this a low or medium weight. Since holding multiple jobs suggests responsibility, perhaps lower risk here.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years. No recent drug use is positive, so probably high protection against recidivism. That would be a high weight for this factor.\n\nDepression: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can contribute to criminal behavior, but since he's not experiencing it now, that's protective. Maybe high weight here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. Larger households might provide more support or structure, which could be protective. So, perhaps low weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has influence over his life. Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior. Maybe medium weight here since it's a positive factor.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant factors are arrest history and lack of recent drug use. These seem to have high weights, suggesting higher likelihood of recidivism. However, other factors like age, education, employment, and household size might mitigate some risk. So overall, the prediction leans towards YES but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals have higher rates of recidivism in previous examples\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: No consistent pattern between race and recidivism observed\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Previous cases show even one arrest can be significant\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Physical stats don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Single status sometimes associated with higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone doesn't consistently predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: GED present but no further education\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Multiple jobs indicate stability, lower risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: No recent use is protective\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Absence of depression is protective\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Larger household may provide support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Religiosity can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
