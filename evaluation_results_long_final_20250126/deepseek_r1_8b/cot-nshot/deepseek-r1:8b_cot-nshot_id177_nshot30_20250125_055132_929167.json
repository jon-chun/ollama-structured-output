    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the likelihood of this 18-year-old male being rearrested within the next three years based on several risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight to them.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting because sometimes an arrest without a conviction doesn't carry the same stigma as a conviction. However, having a recent arrest is still concerning. I think this should be a medium risk because it shows he's engaged in behavior that could lead to further issues.\n\nNext, his height is 6 feet 0 inches. I'm not sure how relevant height is in this context. Maybe taller individuals might have different circumstances, but without more info, I'll consider it low impact. So, low weight for this factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to more exposure to negative influences or less support. But if he's in school, maybe that provides some structure. Still, the lack of marriage and living alone could be medium risk.\n\nHe is enrolled in school currently. School involvement can be a protective factor, suggesting he's involved in constructive activities. This seems positive, so I'll assign it a low weight because it reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might increase the risk of getting involved in criminal behavior again. This is a medium risk factor because without work, he may have more time or motivation for problematic activities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Not using drugs is a positive sign, indicating he's making healthier choices. This should be a low weight since it suggests he's less likely to engage in criminal behavior tied to substance use.\n\nSome of the time during the past month, he has felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. Depression or similar mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism because they might lead to despondent behaviors or poor decision-making. This is a high-weight factor because untreated mental health issues are significant risks.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially with just a mother, can have both positive and negative influences. It's medium risk because it provides some support but might also expose him to stressors common in urban environments.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity or belief in a higher power can be protective, as it often correlates with better decision-making and social support. This is low weight because the presence of such beliefs is generally positive.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risk factor is his current emotional state, followed by unemployment, arrest history, living situation, and lack of marriage.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Having a recent arrest increases the likelihood of further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"Height does not significantly impact recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marriage can lead to exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school suggests positive engagement and lower criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment increases stress and potential for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs indicates better decision-making and reduced criminal risk\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down can lead to poor decisions and increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban household with a single parent may introduce stressors\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide protective factors against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
