    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested, but it's not a direct correlation. Maybe medium weight since at 170 lbs he\u2019s on the higher side but not extremely so. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might increase risk due to fewer supports.\n\nHe has a high school diploma, which is positive, reducing some risks compared to those without education. He isn't enrolled in college, which could be negative because education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe held 2 jobs this year. Employment seems like a strong positive indicator; people with stable work are less likely to reoffend.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t used drugs for four years. No recent drug use is definitely a positive factor, reducing the likelihood of future offenses linked to substance abuse.\n\nHe reported feeling down at times during the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so this might be a risk factor.\n\nHe comes from a household of size 4 with both biological parents, which is stable but doesn't directly indicate much about his current situation.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his life. Religiosity isn\u2019t explicitly tied to recidivism in the examples, but it can sometimes be protective.\n\nHe's been arrested 3 times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior. This is a strong negative factor.\n\nLooking at all these factors together: He has a stable household background, is employed, educated, not using drugs, but has a history of arrest and conviction. The fact that he feels down might indicate some stress or instability, which could be a risk. His lack of college enrollment might limit his options, increasing recidivism risk.\n\nThe key factors seem to be his criminal history (high), employment (low to medium positive), education (low negative if not enrolled in higher ed), and mental health (could be high negative). His weight is neutral.\n\nConsidering all, I'd assign high risk to criminal history, medium to employment, low to education, medium to mental health, and possibly low to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
