    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each of their characteristics and see how they might contribute to recidivism.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is on the younger side but not extremely high. People in their early twenties often have higher rates of criminal behavior, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nThey're male, and from the examples provided, males tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to females. So that's another medium risk.\n\nIdentifying as Black might be a demographic factor; from the previous cases, being Black sometimes correlates with higher recidivism, but it can vary based on other factors. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nThey've been arrested once and convicted, which suggests they have some criminal history. Prior convictions are a strong indicator of future rearrest, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nTheir weight is 190 lbs., height 5'9\", so they might be in a moderate build, which doesn't directly correlate but could influence behavior choices.\n\nNever been married and currently living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that's medium risk.\n\nThey don't have a high school diploma or GED and aren't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and increases chances of involvement in criminal behavior. That's a high risk.\n\nNo jobs held during the year indicates they might be unemployed or not stable, which can contribute to recidivism. So that's medium.\n\nThey haven't used drugs in the past four years, but being downcast most of the time suggests possible emotional instability or stressors that could lead to criminal behavior. That's a bit tricky\u2014maybe low since no recent drug use, but the depression might be a factor. I'll go with medium.\n\nAt a young age, they lived with their biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 6. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban setting, can have both positive and negative influences. Without more info on whether the home was supportive or not, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this as low.\n\nThey don't believe God affects their life, which might indicate a lack of religious or spiritual support, potentially increasing risk. That's medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction is high, lack of education and employment are high, living alone is medium, being male is medium, criminal history is high, emotional issues are medium. So the highest risks are prior conviction (high) and lack of education/employment (high). The other factors add some but less weight.\n\nSo overall, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age may increase risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Males often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Being Black may correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Prior arrest and conviction increase risk\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Moderate build doesn't directly correlate with behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone may reduce supervision, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education limits employment and increases criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: No jobs held suggests instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No recent drug use, but emotional issues may contribute\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Large household in urban area's impact is unclear\"),\n    (\"religion_or_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of belief in higher power may increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
