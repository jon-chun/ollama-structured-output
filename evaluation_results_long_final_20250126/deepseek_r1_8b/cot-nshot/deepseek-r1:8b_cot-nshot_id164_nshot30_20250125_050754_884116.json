    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll give that a medium weight because being young can indicate higher risk, but not as high as other factors sometimes are.\n\nNext, race: he's White. In the examples, both Black and White individuals had varying outcomes, so maybe race alone isn't the most significant factor here. I'll assign it a low weight since it might not be as impactful on its own.\n\nArrest history: he has been arrested once and convicted. Multiple arrests are shown in some examples to correlate with higher recidivism rates. So this is a key factor; high weight makes sense here because prior convictions often predict future behavior.\n\nWeight is between 150-174 lbs, which is within a normal range. In the examples, being overweight or underweight wasn't directly correlated with recidivism, so I'll give this a low weight since it doesn't seem to contribute much.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married. In some cases, marriage can be a stabilizing factor. If someone is single, especially if they have fewer ties, they might be more prone to reoffending. So this could be medium weight because unmarried individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates.\n\nLiving situation: currently living alone. From the examples, living alone sometimes led to higher risk, but not always. It's a factor that could increase risk moderately, so I'll give it a medium weight.\n\nEducation level: he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is a strong protective factor. Those with higher education are less likely to reoffend. So this should be given a high weight because education significantly reduces recidivism risk.\n\nEmployment: he held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, which are protective factors. However, only holding one job might not be as impactful as having more stable employment. Still, it's a positive sign, so medium weight makes sense.\n\nDrug use: he hasn't used drugs in four years. Histories of drug use are strong predictors of recidivism. Being clean for four years is a good indicator, so this should be high weight because substance abuse is a major risk factor.\n\nMental health: he hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, but it's complex. Without more info, I'll give it a low weight since recent mental health isn't reported as an issue here.\n\nFamily background: he lived with both parents in a household of size 4. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective. So this is a strong positive factor and should be given high weight because family support can deter recidivism.\n\nReligious beliefs: he considers God influential in his life. Religiosity can be a protective factor, so I'll give it medium weight since it's not explicitly stated how strong that influence is.\n\nPutting it all together: the strongest factors are arrest history and education, both high weight. Employment is medium, living alone is medium, family background is high, and religious beliefs are medium. Age is medium, race low, weight low, marital status medium, drug use high.\n\nSo, considering these weighted factors, I think the prediction leans towards \"NO\" rearrest because of the strong protective factors like education, stable family, employment, and no recent drug use. However, having a prior conviction does increase risk moderately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"race alone doesn't significantly affect recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"prior convictions are strong predictors\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"weight within normal range, not impactful\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"unmarried individuals may have higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone can increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"higher education reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"job stability is protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"no recent drug use is a strong positive factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no info on current mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"stable family environment is protective\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"religious beliefs can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
