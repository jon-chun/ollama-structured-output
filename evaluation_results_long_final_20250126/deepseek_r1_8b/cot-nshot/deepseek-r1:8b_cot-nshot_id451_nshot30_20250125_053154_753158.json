    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 20-year-old White female will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of her factors one by one and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst off, she's been arrested once and convicted. That suggests she has some criminal history, which usually increases the likelihood of further arrests. I think that's a significant factor, so maybe medium weight.\n\nShe's 5'8\" and weighs 135 lbs. Not sure if her height or weight are relevant here, but maybe if she's taller or heavier, she might be more capable of avoiding situations that lead to rearrest. But without clear indicators, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently not living alone. That means she's likely still dependent on others for support. Living alone can sometimes correlate with better decision-making or access to resources, so her situation might be a bit of a risk. Maybe medium weight here because not having a stable living situation could lead to more criminal opportunities.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a four-year college. Education level is generally a positive factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. Being in college might also provide structure and support that prevents rearrest. So this seems like a strong protective factor, probably medium weight.\n\nShe's held three jobs this year. Employment usually indicates stability and financial independence, which can deter criminal activities. This looks promising, so high weight here.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor, but since she's not currently using it and isn't experiencing depression, this might be less concerning than if she were using now or dealing with mental health issues. Maybe low to medium weight.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of two. Growing up in a small family in an urban environment can have mixed effects. On one hand, it might provide some support, but on the other hand, urban areas often have higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal behavior. I think this could be medium weight.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has something to do with her outcome. Religious beliefs can sometimes influence behavior positively, so this is a protective factor. Maybe high weight here because it suggests she might seek alternative ways to cope without resorting to crime.\n\nPutting it all together: Arrest history is significant (medium), employment is strong (high), education is positive (medium), living situation is mixed (medium), drug use is low impact now (low), family background could be medium, and religious beliefs are high. So overall, I'm leaning towards lower risk factors, but her criminal history still counts.\n\nI think she has some risk factors, especially the arrest record, but there are also protective factors like education and employment. It's a bit of a balance, so my confidence isn't super high either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, indicating some criminal history which typically increases the likelihood of further arrests\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"She has held three jobs this year, indicating stability and financial independence which can deter criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which are positive factors reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"She is currently not living alone, which might increase risk as she may have less stable support and more exposure to potential criminal opportunities\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana in the past but isn't currently using it or dealing with depression, reducing immediate risk factors\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a small urban household could expose her to higher crime rates despite potential family support\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Her belief that God influences her outcome may contribute positively by encouraging lawful behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
