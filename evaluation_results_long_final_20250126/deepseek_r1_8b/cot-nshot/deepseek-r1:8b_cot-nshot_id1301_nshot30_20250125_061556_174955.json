    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their factors one by one and assign a weight based on what I know from the previous examples.\n\nFirst off, she's been arrested twice and convicted. That's two convictions, which seems significant. Looking back at the examples, having multiple arrests definitely increased the chance of recidivism. So, I think this is a high risk factor because a history of convictions is a strong indicator that someone might reoffend.\n\nNext, her age is 18. Younger individuals are generally more impulsive and may have less developed decision-making skills. From previous data, younger people had higher recidivism rates, so being 18 is probably medium to high risk. Given she's just 18, maybe a high weight here because youthfulness can contribute to higher likelihoods.\n\nShe identifies as Black. In the examples provided, race didn't directly correlate with recidivism outcomes in an obvious way, but some studies suggest that systemic issues might affect recidivism rates differently for different groups. However, since there wasn't explicit data on this aspect, I might lean towards medium risk here because it's a social factor that can influence outcomes.\n\nShe lives alone now. From the examples, living situations varied, and sometimes being alone was seen as a positive (like having more stability), but in other cases, it didn't have a clear effect. I think this could be medium risk since independence might contribute to better outcomes, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment, which often correlates with recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor because education is crucial for reducing criminal behavior.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Having employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which are protective factors against recidivism. The more stable her job is, the less likely she might be to reoffend. So, having two jobs is a positive sign. This would probably be a low risk factor because work can deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past year. Drug use, especially marijuana, is often linked to higher recidivism rates. However, it's important to note that she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's addressing some underlying issues. Still, substance use itself is a high risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior and more arrests.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is a critical factor in recidivism. If she's not experiencing depression now, that could mean she's managing her mental health effectively, which would be protective. This might be a low risk factor because good mental health can reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 when younger. Larger households might offer more support and supervision, which can be protective. However, being in a household with five people could also mean higher stress or overcrowding. It's hard to determine without more context, but I think this is medium risk because family support can both help and hinder depending on the dynamics.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it provides a sense of purpose and social support. This might reduce recidivism, so I'd assign low risk here since it's a positive influence.\n\nPutting all these together: convictions (high), age (high), race (medium), living situation (medium), education (high), employment (low), substance use (high), mental health (low), household size (medium), and religiosity (low). \n\nSo, weighting them as:\n- High: convictions, age, education, substance use\n- Medium: race, living situation, household size\n- Low: employment, mental health, religiosity\n\nAdding these up, the high factors are more impactful, so I think there's a 70% chance she'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
