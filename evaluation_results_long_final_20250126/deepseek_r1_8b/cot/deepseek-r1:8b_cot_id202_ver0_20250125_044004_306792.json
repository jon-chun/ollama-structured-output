    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down each part step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a White female. I remember that race can be a factor in the criminal justice system, but it's tricky because sometimes it's conflated with other variables like socioeconomic status. So maybe her race is a low factor on its own, but combined with others, it could contribute more.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted, which means she has some history of violating the law. That seems pretty straightforward\u2014arrest and conviction are medium risk factors because they indicate past criminal behavior.\n\nHer height is 5'7\" and weight between 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats directly correlate with recidivism, but obesity can sometimes be linked to higher risks due to mental health or socioeconomic issues. Maybe that's a low factor unless combined with other high factors.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she lacks the support system that could help her stay on track, so that could be medium risk. Being single doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk, though.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to poverty, which is linked to criminal behavior. So that's definitely a high factor.\n\nShe held one job last year. Having a job is positive but only once. If she's employed, maybe it stabilizes her life, so this could be medium or low, depending on how stable the job is. The text here says \"held 1 job,\" which might not indicate strong commitment.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't a huge indicator unless it's frequent or leads to more severe issues. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe her substance use is less problematic now. So drug use could be medium risk because it's recent but not necessarily severe.\n\nShe doesn't feel depressed over the past month. Mental health is a big factor in recidivism. Feeling not depressed could mean lower risk, so that might be low unless other factors push it higher.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Growing up in a large, possibly chaotic family and an urban environment can contribute to higher risks due to exposure to crime and instability. That's probably high risk because it's a significant adverse childhood experience.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective or sometimes lead to more rigid thinking. I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism, so maybe low unless combined with other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: arrest and conviction are definite medium risks. Education is a high factor because lack of it is strongly linked. Family background is also high. Employment is medium. Drug use is medium. The rest seem lower, but the family and education might outweigh others.\n\nSo confidence is about 70% based on these factors, but I'm not entirely sure. It's a balance between her past conviction, lack of education, family issues, and some protective factors like current employment and no recent depression.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White female's potential impact in criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest and conviction indicate past legal issues\"),\n    (\"physical_statistics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits opportunities, linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job may indicate stability but not commitment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use could pose risks\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression recent\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Adverse childhood experience increases risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer protection\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
