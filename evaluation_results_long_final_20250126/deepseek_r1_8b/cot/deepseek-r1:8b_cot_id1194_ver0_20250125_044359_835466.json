    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a 19-year-old male identifying as Black. Being a young adult can be a risk factor because younger people might have higher impulsivity and less developed decision-making skills. Also, being Black in the criminal justice system often means they face systemic biases that could increase their chances of rearrest.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That means he's had some contact with the law but hasn't been found guilty yet. This could mean he's more likely to continue behaviors that might lead to further arrests, either because he's learned from past interactions or because he's testing boundaries.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 185 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight plays into criminal behavior, but being in this range isn't particularly low or high. Maybe it's a neutral factor unless there are other considerations like health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure of a family to support him or monitor his activities, potentially increasing risks. Also, being single could mean less accountability mechanisms in place.\n\nHe hasn't completed high school or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities and life skills, making it harder to integrate into society positively. Without education, he might turn to more risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. This shows some responsibility and income stability, which could be a positive factor. Employment often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides structure and purpose.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is a good sign. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, so not feeling depressed lowers that risk. However, he might have other underlying issues or stressors not mentioned here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Growing up in such an environment could increase his chances of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. This could be a protective factor if it gives him a sense of purpose or control, but sometimes religious beliefs aren't enough on their own to prevent criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Age and race are high risks. Arrest history is medium because he's had contact but no conviction. Living situation and education are medium\u2014living alone can be risky, not having an education makes it harder. Employment is a positive, lowing the risk. No recent drug use and no depression are positives. The urban background and religious belief are medium factors.\n\nSo, weighing these, I think there's a medium to high risk. But considering he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe medium overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age may increase impulsivity and lower decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Systemic biases in the criminal justice system can disproportionately affect Black individuals\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction may indicate behavior that could lead to further arrests\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone provides some autonomy, though without family structure\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and life skills\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs, showing responsibility and income stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk associated with substance-related crimes\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed lowers the risk associated with coping mechanisms for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"childhood_env\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing increases exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a sense of purpose but alone isn't sufficient\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
