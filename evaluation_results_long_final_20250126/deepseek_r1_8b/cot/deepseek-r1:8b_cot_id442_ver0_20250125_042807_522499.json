    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. He's Black, 6'1\", 180 lbs, single, living alone, enrolled in school, has held 5 jobs this year. He's used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. He grew up in a big household in an urban area with his biological mother, and he believes God plays a personal role in his life.\n\nFirst, I should break down each factor one by one.\n\nRace: Being Black is often associated with higher risk factors due to systemic issues and higher likelihood of rearrest. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nAge: 20 is considered a prime age for recidivism, so medium to high.\n\nHistory of substance use: He used marijuana recently, which is a drug, increasing the risk. High.\n\nEmployment: Held 5 jobs; stable employment can reduce risk, so low or maybe medium.\n\nEducation: Enrolled in school, which is positive, so lower risk.\n\nFamily background: Grew up in a large household in an urban area, which might mean more exposure to crime, so high.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes in God's influence on his life. This can sometimes be protective, but it might also tie into substance use if he uses as part of coping. Maybe medium.\n\nCurrent emotional state: Felt down recently; emotional issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so medium to high.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Single parents are more at risk for recidivism? Not sure. Maybe medium.\n\nPrior arrest and conviction: He's been arrested once and convicted, which is a strong indicator. High.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\nRace - high\nAge - medium\nSubstance use - high\nEmployment - low\nEducation - low\nFamily - high\nReligion - medium\nEmotional state - medium\nMarital status - medium\nPrior conviction - high\n\nSo each of these factors contributes to the risk. The presence of a prior conviction is a significant factor, so that's definitely high. Substance use and family background also point towards higher risk.\n\nNow, considering all together, it's likely he will be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues contributing to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adulthood is a high-risk period for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use increases likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school suggests positive trajectory\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing and large family may expose to crime\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence can be protective or lead to coping issues via substance use\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single living alone may increase risk\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Arrest and conviction are strong predictors of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
