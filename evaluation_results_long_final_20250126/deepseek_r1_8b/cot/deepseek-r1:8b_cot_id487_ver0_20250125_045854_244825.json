    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old female who has been arrested twice but not convicted. She's White, 5'2\", 160 lbs, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma and is in college. She's held two jobs this year. She has a history of drug use, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and she's been feeling down a lot recently. She grew up in a rural area with both biological parents in a household of four. She doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, I should break down each factor one by one to determine their weights as low, medium, or high. The goal is to predict if she'll be rearrested within three years.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: She's been arrested twice but not convicted. This suggests she has some criminal involvement but hasn't been formalized yet. I think this is a medium factor because it indicates she's engaged in criminal behavior but might not have a significant history of convictions, which could influence future behavior.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and feels down a lot. Drug use itself can be a high risk factor as it's linked to higher recidivism rates. Feeling down could indicate stress or instability, potentially increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior again.\n\n3. **Employment Status**: She's held two jobs this year. Stable employment is usually a positive sign, so I'd consider this a low factor. It suggests she has some structure and responsibility, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Living Situation**: Living alone might mean she lacks supervision or support, which could be a medium risk factor. Without family around, she might have more freedom to engage in risky behaviors.\n\n5. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household of four with both parents is generally stable, so this would likely be a low factor. Stability in upbringing can contribute positively to behavior.\n\n6. **Lack of Belief in God**: This could indicate a lack of moral framework or social support, which might be a medium risk factor. If she doesn't find guidance from religion, she may have fewer resources for self-improvement.\n\n7. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma and is in college, which are positive indicators. Higher education can reduce recidivism, so this would be a low factor.\n\n8. **Age**: Being 21 is relatively young, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. However, younger individuals might have higher energy levels that could lead to more risk-taking behavior, making this a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors seem to be arrest history and drug use, both of which are high risks. The other factors like employment, living situation, family background, education, and age are lower or medium. \n\nHer feeling down could exacerbate issues, possibly leading to more criminal behavior. Without a strong support system (like belief in God), she might struggle more. However, her current job stability is positive.\n\nSo, I'd assign high risk to drug use and arrest history. The others are medium, low, or negligible. Combining these, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with high confidence because of the high-risk factors outweighing others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating some criminal involvement without formal convictions\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs this year, indicating stable employment which can deter criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lead to more freedom for risky behaviors without supervision\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up in a stable household with both parents, providing positive influence\"),\n    (\"lack_of_belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief might reduce access to moral or social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are positive indicators for behavior\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger age may contribute to higher energy levels and risk-taking behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
