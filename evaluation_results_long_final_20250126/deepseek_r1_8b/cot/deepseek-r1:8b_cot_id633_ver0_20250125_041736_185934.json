    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this guy's risk of rearrest within the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. I know that age can be a big factor\u2014yOUNGER people might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing, right? But his specific age is 20, which is on the lower side. His ethnicity is Hispanic; I've heard that some demographic groups might have different rates, but I'm not sure if it's a significant indicator or not.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That seems pretty high, especially for someone so young. If he's been in trouble before, it suggests he might continue that behavior. So this factor is probably a 'high' risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and 180 lbs. Doesn't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior. Maybe if he had a history of violence or something related, but nothing here stands out as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Single people can sometimes have different circumstances\u2014maybe more time for troublemaking? Or maybe they're more isolated and have less support. This could contribute, so I'll consider it medium to high risk.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a big red flag. Without basic skills, it's harder to find stable employment and might lead to more criminal activities. Definitely a 'high' risk here.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having some work experience isn't great if it's just one job and maybe not stable. Doesn't show strong ties to the community or support systems, so this is another high risk factor.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of future behavior, but for someone who has been arrested before, it might mean he's continuing risky behaviors, which could lead to more arrests. This is medium to high.\n\nHe feels down and nothing cheers him up most days. That sounds like depression or emotional issues. People with mental health problems can be at higher risk for criminal behavior because they might struggle with coping mechanisms. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area as a kid. Urban environments are known to have higher crime rates, and growing up in a big household might mean he was exposed to more chaos or learned behaviors from family. Plus, being in an urban setting now increases his exposure. So this is medium to high risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That's a bit of a personal belief. I'm not sure how that ties into criminal behavior but maybe it relates to his choices and mindset. It might be more of a background factor, so perhaps low to medium risk here.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors like arrest history, lack of education, current substance use, mental health issues, urban background, and past job indicate high risk. The belief in God is less clear, but maybe it's not as impactful. So I think most factors are high, with some possibly medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age may contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone isn't a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and convictions suggest continued risk\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"No relevant physical description for risk assessment\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate isolation or lack of support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma and no college enrollment is a high risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"One job may not provide stability or support\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use in the last four years could be a medium risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down frequently indicates potential for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing and large household may increase exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might not directly correlate to criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
