Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, demographic factors. He's White, which might have some implications in the criminal justice system, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a significant factor on its own. His age is 21, which is young, and younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates. That seems like a medium risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support system that could help him stay out of trouble. That could be a medium factor as well.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can contribute to higher unemployment rates, which is linked to criminal behavior. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, so not having a stable job might increase the risk, making this another high factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't always a red flag, but considering he's been convicted, it's likely related to criminal activity, so that's medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can lead to substance abuse and criminal behavior, so not feeling depressed might lower his risk slightly, making this a low factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four with his biological mother. Larger families can provide more support or sometimes lead to higher stress if there are issues. Without knowing the family dynamics, it's hard, but maybe medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God. Religion can play a role in providing moral support and guiding behavior. Losing that might increase risk, so that's medium.\n\nPutting this all together: age is young (medium), education level is high risk, employment is high, drug use is medium, living alone is medium, no religious beliefs are medium, lack of depression is low, family structure might be medium. So the highest factors are education and employment at high, others as medium or low.\n\nNow, predicting rearrest: High from education and employment, plus other mediums. That could lead to a prediction of YES with confidence around 75.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Stable employment reduces the risk of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Previous drug use is a known risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression may lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger households can influence family dynamics\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"No religious beliefs might increase risk behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
