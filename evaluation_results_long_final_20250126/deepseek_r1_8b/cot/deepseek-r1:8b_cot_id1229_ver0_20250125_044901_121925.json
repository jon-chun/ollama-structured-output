    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst off, her age is 19, which is pretty young. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less experienced in managing their behavior and decisions. So I think that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black. From what I know, being part of a minority group can sometimes increase the likelihood of rearrest due to systemic issues and discrimination in the criminal justice system. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe has no prior convictions, which is positive. But she has been arrested once, which shows some involvement with the legal system, so maybe that's a medium risk.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'5\" and 145 lbs. I don't know if that directly relates to recidivism, but sometimes health or size can affect how someone interacts with law enforcement. Maybe low risk there.\n\nShe hasn't married yet and lives alone. Independence might be good or bad depending on the situation, but without more info, it's hard to say. Maybe medium.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not in college. Lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism because people may struggle to find stable jobs or cope with stress. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs this year. Stable employment is usually a positive indicator, so that might be low risk.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years and feels down recently. Drug use itself isn't always bad, but feeling down could mean higher stress or instability, leading to potential criminal behavior. That looks like a medium-high risk factor because substance abuse can contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe was part of a household with five people as a child. Larger families might provide more support, but sometimes lead to higher crime rates too. I'm not sure, maybe medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: She thinks God is involved in her personal life. Religion can be a source of support or may influence decision-making differently. Not sure if that's high, medium, or low risk here. Maybe medium because it could either help or hinder, depending on the situation.\n\nPutting it all together, I think she has several high and medium risk factors that could increase her chances of rearrest. But there are also some positive factors like employment and no prior convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age may contribute to higher recidivism due to lack of experience in decision-making\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Minority status can increase risk due to systemic issues in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history indicates potential for future criminal behavior despite no convictions\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical stats don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate independence but could also lead to stress or instability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Low education increases risk as it affects job stability and coping skills\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a positive indicator reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium_high\", \"Recent drug use and mood issues may lead to higher criminal activity\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may provide support but could also be associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can either support or hinder behavior, making the impact uncertain\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
