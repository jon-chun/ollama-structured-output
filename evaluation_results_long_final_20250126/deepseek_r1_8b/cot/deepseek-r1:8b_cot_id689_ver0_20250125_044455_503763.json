    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's likelihood of being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. The race or ethnicity might influence things like sentencing practices or social support systems. I'm not sure if it's high risk or medium. Maybe medium because some studies show that racial disparities exist but they can be influenced by other factors too.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests he's had some interaction with the criminal justice system before. That might lean towards a higher risk since previous involvement is a predictor of recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight is 130 lbs. I don't know how physical appearance affects risk, but maybe it doesn't have much impact. Maybe low or medium here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support system that married individuals often have, which could increase risk because they lack supervision or help when needed. So perhaps medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having an education level of high school can sometimes be a protective factor, but not having further education might be a risk. I think this could lean towards medium since being employed (from the next point) is a positive, but without college, it's a slight negative.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs during the year, which shows some stability and responsibility. Employment can deter criminal behavior as it provides structure and income. So this should be a strong protective factor, maybe high.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. He also felt down and hopeless in the past month, which could indicate higher risk of committing crimes due to emotional issues. So drug use and emotional distress both point towards high risk here.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in an urban area as a young child. Urban areas tend to have higher crime rates and more social issues, so that's another medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religion or spirituality can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support or a sense of purpose. So maybe low here.\n\nPutting it all together: age, criminal history, employment, drug use, living situation, and family background. The big factors are the criminal history and recent drug use, which are high risks. His education and employment might mitigate some of that, but they're not enough to override those two. His feelings of hopelessness and urban upbringing add medium to medium-high risk.\n\nSo overall prediction leans towards YES with high confidence around 85% because of the strong factors pointing towards recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Previous studies indicate that racial disparities can influence outcomes, but other factors also play a role.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical appearance\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics have minimal impact on criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk due to lack of support\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is protective, but lack of further education is a concern\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Employment provides stability and reduces crime\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"emotional state\", \"high\", \"Feelings of hopelessness can lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to higher social issues\"),\n    (\"religion/spirituality\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective, but impact varies\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
