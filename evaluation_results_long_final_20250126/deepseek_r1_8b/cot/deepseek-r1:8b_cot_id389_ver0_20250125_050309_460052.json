    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person and predict if he'll be rearrested in three years. Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nHe's a 22-year-old White male, single, living alone, and has a high school diploma. He's been arrested once and convicted, so that's a point against him. But only one arrest isn't a huge red flag on its own. He's held three jobs this year, which shows he can commit to work, maybe indicating some responsibility.\n\nHe doesn't use drugs anymore and hasn't felt depressed recently, which are positives. Not using drugs lowers the risk compared to someone who might be abusing them. His past living situation was with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. That's a bit vague, but family structure can influence behavior. I'm not sure how much that contributes, though.\n\nReligiously, he believes God has something to do with his life personally. That could mean he has strong beliefs that might guide his actions positively or negatively. It might give him a sense of purpose, which is good, or maybe he uses religion as an excuse for behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone, so there's no spouse or dependents. That might increase risk because there's less accountability or support systems. Or it could mean he has more freedom to engage in criminal activities without consequences from a family.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma, not college, which is a common factor linked to higher recidivism. Employment history is three jobs this year, which is positive, but if he had previous issues at work or volatility, that might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the factors one by one: criminal history is low (one conviction), employment is medium (three jobs), religion is unclear but potentially medium, family structure maybe low or medium. Age is 22, which is younger and often associated with higher risk due to impulsivity.\n\nThe prediction should consider these weighted factors. If I assign moderate weights except for the ones that are clearly positive like employment and no recent depression. Criminal history is a strong indicator of recidivism, so maybe high weight there. Family and religion could be medium, age is medium, education low.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history (high), age (medium), family/religion (maybe medium), education (low). If I sum these up, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"He has been convicted once, which is a significant indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher risk due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household with four members may provide some stability but details are limited\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence could indicate a support system or potential for positive behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is common, but not as protective as college education\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs this year suggest responsibility but more context needed\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
