    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. I know that age can play a role in recidivism, but it's not clear how significant. Younger people might have higher rates, but being 21 isn't necessarily high risk on its own. His race is white, which sometimes can be a demographic factor, but I'm not sure if that directly impacts rearrest rates.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because arrest alone doesn't always lead to conviction or future criminal behavior. Maybe he was arrested for minor offenses or had charges dropped. Unconvicted individuals might have lower tendencies to reoffend, but it's not a sure thing either.\n\nHis physical build is 5'11\" and 182 lbs. I don't know how physical size relates to recidivism. It could affect factors like job stability or ability to commit certain crimes, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and lives alone. Single people might have different social influences, but living alone doesn't inherently increase or decrease risk of rearrest. It's possible he has more time for criminal activities if he's home more, but that's speculative.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can impact employment opportunities and socioeconomic status, which are tied to recidivism. Higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, so not being in college might be a risk factor.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Having only one job doesn't tell me much on its own, but if it's steady or low-paying, that could increase risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism, so his abstinence from drugs for four years is positive. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, so not feeling depressed lowers the risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family structure can influence outcomes; having both parents might provide better support or discipline, which could reduce recidivism. Urban areas themselves have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than personal factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, so this is a positive sign.\n\nPutting it all together: he's young, hasn't been convicted despite arrests, has some education and employment, no recent substance abuse or depression, grew up in a stable family environment, and has religious beliefs. These factors seem to lower his risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals may have higher rates of recidivism, but at 21 it's not extremely high.\" ),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a demographic factor, being White doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates.\" ),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Arrests without convictions don't always predict future behavior.\" ),\n    (\"physical_size\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone doesn't indicate significant risk for recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently increase rearrest risk, though it might provide more time for criminal activities.\" ),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of college enrollment can be a moderate risk factor due to lower socioeconomic status.\" ),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having one job suggests some stability, which may reduce recidivism risk.\" ),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs for four years is a positive indicator.\" ),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers the likelihood of criminal behavior related to coping mechanisms.\" ),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area provides a stable environment, which can be protective against recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is a positive factor that may reduce criminal behavior.\" )\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
