    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic info: Hispanic, 5'11\", 210 lbs. Being slightly overweight might contribute to health issues which could lead to problems in life, but I'm not sure if that's directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't married yet, lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might mean he doesn't have the structure of a family to support him or monitor his activities. On the other hand, some people thrive independently.\n\nEducation: He didn't complete high school or get his GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is often a significant factor in recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment, which is linked to criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment: He's held two jobs this year. Stable employment is usually a positive indicator; it provides structure and income that can reduce criminal tendencies.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use, especially if it's within the last year or so, is a strong predictor of continued problems and potential recidivism.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior, but since he's not currently experiencing it, maybe this isn't as big a concern right now.\n\nFamily background: He lived with his mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can have negative influences and increase the risk of getting involved in the criminal justice system.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and structure, which might reduce criminal behavior, but it's not clear how strong this effect is.\n\nArrest and conviction history: Two arrests and at least one conviction. Having a criminal record itself increases the likelihood of future rearrests because it affects employment opportunities, housing, etc., which can lead to more strained circumstances.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors that stand out as high risk are his criminal history, drug use, and family background. His education and employment might mitigate some risks, but they aren't enough on their own. His mental health seems okay for now, but past drug use is a concern.\n\nSo, I think he has a medium to high risk of rearrest in the next three years. But considering his current employment and no recent depression, maybe it's more towards medium-high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"past arrests and convictions significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"recent drug use is a strong predictor of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"living in an urban single-parent household increases exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"lack of education may contribute but is not the primary factor here\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"stable employment reduces risk, but not enough alone\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no current depression reduces immediate risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs can sometimes mitigate behavior but effect unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
