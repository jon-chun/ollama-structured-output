    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old being rearrested within the next three years. He hasn't been convicted yet but has been arrested once. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographics: he's a white male. I remember that racial factors can influence sentencing, but it's more about how the system treats different races rather than the individual's risk. Maybe it's a low factor because it's more about systemic issues than personal traits.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 185 lbs. I'm not sure how height and weight relate to recidivism. Maybe someone's build affects their ability to escape or physical health, but I don't have enough info here. I'll tentatively mark this as low.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to less supervision or social support. But if he has steady employment, maybe that reduces the risk. His job history is two jobs in a year, which is positive. That could mean he's responsible, so living alone might not be as big of an issue.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a medium to high factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is definitely a risk factor, especially for recidivism. Even if he's not currently using, having a history can indicate higher risk. I'll go with medium here since he's not using now but has a history.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is good because depression can lead to criminal behavior. So this is a low factor.\n\nHe grew up in an urban household of five with his biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and may expose individuals to more risk factors. Also, living in a large family might mean he had more exposure to criminal influences or stressors. This seems like a medium factor because while the environment is risky, it's not the most severe.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism rates as it provides a sense of purpose and moral guidance. So this might be a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: education is high risk, drug use medium, urban background medium, and others are low. I'm leaning towards a medium overall risk because the most significant factors point in that direction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
