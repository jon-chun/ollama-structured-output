    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this 21-year-old white woman being rearrested within three years. She's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her criminal history is limited\u2014only one arrest without a conviction. That might mean she hasn't had much opportunity or reason to reoffend before. But I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator either way. Some people with no convictions might be less likely to reoffend, while others might have underlying issues that lead them back into the criminal justice system.\n\nShe identifies as white, which I know can sometimes be a demographic factor in rearrest rates, but I'm not entirely sure how significant it is compared to other factors like age or socioeconomic status. I should consider if being white correlates with higher or lower recidivism, but without specific data, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's 21, which is on the younger side. Younger people might be more impulsive, and substance abuse can be a factor here since she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which could influence her behavior. If she's not currently depressed, maybe substance use isn't as significant a driver now.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Being alone might mean she lacks the support system that could help her avoid criminal behavior. On the other hand, living alone doesn't necessarily mean she's engaged in any positive coping mechanisms or supports.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma, which is generally better than not having it, but without college enrollment, maybe she doesn't have the same structure or resources as someone with higher education. Job stability might play a role\u2014if she held four jobs last year, that suggests some responsibility and earnings, which could be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nShe has used drugs recently, specifically marijuana and cocaine, which are illicit substances. Current drug use can increase the likelihood of rearrest because it often goes hand-in-hand with other risky behaviors or criminal activities. But since she hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe her substance use isn't as severe or frequent as it could be.\n\nShe was raised in a large household (six people) in an urban area. Growing up in a big family might provide more support or differently influence her behavior compared to someone from a smaller family. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, which could increase the risk of rearrest.\n\nHer religious beliefs, believing that God has something to do with her personal life, might be a protective factor if she uses religion as a coping mechanism or moral guide. However, it's also possible that this belief could conflict with other aspects of her life, though I'm not sure how that would directly affect recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together: low criminal history, no current depression, some job stability, but significant substance use and living in an urban area. These factors seem to somewhat balance each other out. Substance abuse is a strong risk factor, but without a prior conviction, maybe she's more likely to get her life on track rather than reoffending. However, urban environments and drug use are significant contributors to recidivism.\n\nI'm not entirely confident in this assessment because each factor could influence the outcome differently. Maybe there's a medium risk, leaning towards high due to substance abuse and living conditions, but tempered by lack of prior convictions and current mental health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction suggests some involvement with the justice system but no prior convictions; higher risk than no history but not as high as multiple convictions\"),\n    (\"demographics_race\", \"low\", \"White demographic may have lower recidivism rates compared to other groups, though this varies by context\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may increase risk due to impulsivity and exposure to substances\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some education, which can be protective against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"low\", \"Four jobs suggest responsibility and stability, potentially reducing criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases risk of rearrest; marijuana and cocaine are particularly problematic\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support systems but could also indicate independence\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\", \"low\", \"Large urban family might offer some support or exposure to crime, balancing the risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God as influential factor may provide moral guidance or coping mechanism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
