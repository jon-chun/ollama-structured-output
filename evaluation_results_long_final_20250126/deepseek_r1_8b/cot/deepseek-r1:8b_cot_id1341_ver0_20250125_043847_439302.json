    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this 21-year-old woman will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of her factors one by one.\n\nFirst off, she has a history of being arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant red flag because it shows she's had run-ins with the law before. Previous criminal history is usually a strong predictor of future recidivism, so I'd say that's a high risk factor right there.\n\nNext, her age is 21. While younger people can still have issues with recidivism, being in your twenties isn't exactly the best track record either. Maybe medium or low? But considering she already has five arrests, it might lean towards higher risk.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic. I know that certain demographic factors can influence recidivism rates, but I'm not entirely sure if Hispanic ethnicity alone is a significant factor without more context. It might be a medium risk factor, but honestly, her criminal history might outweigh this.\n\nHer weight and height aren't directly related to criminal behavior, so maybe those are low or medium. She's 5'2\" and 218 lbs, which might indicate some weight issues, but I don't see how that ties into recidivism much. Not a big factor here.\n\nShe's married and living alone. Having a stable marriage can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior, so that could be a positive factor. Maybe that reduces her risk compared to someone without such support, so perhaps low or medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education levels can influence future outcomes. Not being in college might mean she's not pursuing further opportunities, which could increase the likelihood of getting into trouble again. So maybe this is a medium factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is a good sign because substance abuse is a major driver of criminal behavior. Feeling not depressed also suggests she's functioning well mentally, so these are both protective factors. I'd rate these as low to medium, maybe even lower for depression since it's only over the past month.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with a household of four, including her biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and may expose individuals to more risks. Also, growing up in a larger family might provide some social support or protection, which could balance things out. Maybe this is a medium factor.\n\nHer lack of religious belief is another factor. I'm not sure how much religion affects recidivism, but some studies suggest it can have a protective effect. Without a strong belief system, she might be more susceptible to engaging in criminal activities. So perhaps that's a medium or high risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together, her extensive criminal history is the most significant factor here. Even though other factors could influence her behavior, the five arrests and convictions are a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. I think she has a high likelihood of being rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 5 times and convicted, indicating a history of law violations\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Although young age can be a neutral factor, her criminal history is more significant\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone does not significantly predict recidivism without more context\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can be protective; living alone may increase risk but overall impact is low\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Not in college might increase risk, though higher education isn't always protective\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests lower mental health risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and larger family provide mixed social support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
