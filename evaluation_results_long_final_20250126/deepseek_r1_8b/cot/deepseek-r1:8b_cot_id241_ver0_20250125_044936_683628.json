    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this 19-year-old woman will be rearrested within the next three years. She hasn't been convicted yet, but she's been arrested once before. Let me break down each of her characteristics and see how they might contribute to her risk.\n\nFirst off, she's a young adult, 19 years old. I know that younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they might make poorer decisions or be less settled in their lives. So that could lean towards medium or high risk. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's not as high.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a huge role here unless there are specific demographics involved. Maybe it's low because it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism much in the justice system.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and 110 lbs. Not sure how physical appearance factors in, but maybe being underweight or not a fit build could be linked to substance use, which is another factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the structure that comes with family or marriage, which can increase risks because there are fewer people checking in on her or supporting her.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education could be a risk factor because it limits her opportunities and might contribute to unemployment or stress, which can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment is important because it provides stability. Having only one job might not be enough, but it's better than none. So maybe this factor isn't as significant unless she's at risk of losing her job.\n\nShe has a history of drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. Recent substance use is a strong indicator for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior. She also feels down most of the time, which might be due to mental health issues or stress, all of which can increase her risk.\n\nShe comes from an urban area with both biological parents, living in a household of four. Growing up in an urban environment often means more exposure to crime and higher stress levels. Also, having two parents might have provided some support, but without knowing their involvement now, it's hard to say. She also believes in God, which might be a form of social support, possibly reducing her risk.\n\nPutting this all together: she has a history of drug use, feels down, and lacks education and employment stability. These are high risk factors. Her age is a medium factor since younger people are more prone, but she hasn't been convicted yet, so maybe not as high. The lack of parental support in her current life could increase her isolation, which might lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nI think the key factors here are her substance use and her emotional state. These are strong indicators that she might be at a higher risk for rearrest. However, without a conviction, there's some uncertainty, but the other factors suggest a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age can lead to impulsive decisions and higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not significantly correlate with recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"physical_appearance\", \"low\", \"Appearance alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risks due to lack of support structure\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"One job shows stability, but not enough to negate other higher risks\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent substance use is a strong indicator for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down may indicate mental health issues that increase criminal risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing increases exposure to crime but benefit from two parents is uncertain\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious belief can provide social support, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
