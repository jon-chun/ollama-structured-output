    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. He's 6'11\" and 230 lbs. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. He hasn't held any jobs this year. In the past four years, he's used marijuana and cocaine. He hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he lived in a household of six, which might indicate some chaotic environment. He also doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, let me break down each factor one by one. Age is 18, which is pretty young. Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may lack impulse control. So, I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, prior criminal history: he's been arrested once and convicted. That's not a lot, but it shows he's encountered the justice system before, which can be a predictor of future issues. Maybe medium or high? It depends on the severity of the conviction. Since it's mentioned as being convicted, it might indicate more than just a simple arrest, so perhaps medium.\n\nRace and ethnicity: he identifies as mixed race. I'm not sure how much this affects recidivism directly, but studies show that minorities are sometimes over-policed, which can contribute to higher rearrests. So maybe medium.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'11\" is taller than average, and 230 lbs is quite heavy for someone his age. Obesity or being overweight can be a risk factor as it's linked to health issues, which might lead to more criminal behavior or poor decisions. I think this could be medium to high.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has fewer supports, which can increase risks. Being single and lacking a stable relationship might contribute to higher recidivism. So maybe medium.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior. Without education, it's harder to find steady employment or improve one's life, leading to more criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment status: He hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment, especially for younger individuals, can lead to boredom, frustration, and higher participation in criminal activities. So this is probably a high factor.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is highly correlated with recidivism. If he's using now, it increases the likelihood of getting rearrested. So definitely high.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes be a risk factor for criminal behavior, but if he's not currently experiencing it, maybe this isn't as big a concern. But past depressions could matter. The info here is limited, so perhaps medium.\n\nFamily structure: Growing up in a household of six might have provided some level of chaos or neglect, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So that's another high factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can be protective against criminal behavior. Without them, maybe higher risk. This could be medium to high.\n\nPutting it all together, I think factors like education, employment, drug use, family structure, and religion are high risk. Age is also a factor but might be slightly lower than others. Prior criminal history is medium since it's not extensive, but he has been convicted. So maybe:\n\n- Education: High\n- Employment: High\n- Drug Use: High\n- Family Structure: High\n- Religion: Medium\n- Prior Criminal History: Medium\n- Age: Maybe High? He's 18, which is quite young and considered high risk for recidivism.\n- Marital Status: Medium\n- Race: Maybe Medium\n\nI'm a bit unsure about how much to weight each. For example, drug use is a strong indicator, so that should be high. Education and employment are also big ones. Age might be high as well. Prior criminal history is medium because it's one conviction.\n\nSo, in the JSON, I'll assign High to Education, Employment, Drug Use, Family Structure, Age, and maybe Race. Medium for Prior Criminal History, Marital Status, and Religion. Maybe lower for Mental Health since he hasn't felt depressed lately.\n\nPrediction: Given all these high-risk factors, especially drug use, lack of education, and unemployment, it's likely he'll be rearrested within three years. So prediction is YES with high confidence, maybe around 85% or so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is strongly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family Structure\", \"high\", \"Chaotic background may contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases risk of impulsive decisions\"),\n    (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Minorities sometimes face over-policing\"),\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"Conviction indicates past legal issues\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships can increase risk\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No current depression, but history could matter\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Without religion may increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
