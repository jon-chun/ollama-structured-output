    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old Black female. From what I know, being younger can be a risk factor because she might have less experience with the criminal justice system and possibly more impulsive behavior. Being Black often correlates with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, so that's a medium risk there.\n\nShe has two arrests but no convictions. Unconvicted people might still have higher risks of future rearrests because they haven't been through the correctional system yet and might not have learned from previous interactions. So I'd consider that a medium risk as well.\n\nHeight is 5'7\". I'm not sure how much height affects recidivism, but taller individuals sometimes have better job opportunities which could reduce criminal involvement. Maybe her height is low, but I don't know if that's significant enough on its own. Maybe it's a low factor.\n\nShe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she lacks the supervision that comes with a family or spouse. That can be a risk because without support, she might struggle more with staying out of trouble. So that's medium.\n\nNo high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big factor for recidivism. Without education, it's harder to find stable employment, which can lead to criminal behavior. This seems like a high risk because education is a strong protective factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment is another major risk factor. Without income and stability, she might turn to criminal activities for money or status. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nDrugs: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of future crime, but if it's recent (within the past year), that could be more concerning. Since it's been four years, maybe it's less immediate, so I'd say medium. But I need to consider if she has other issues like addiction or criminal history tied to drug use.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health can influence behavior. If she's not currently struggling with depression, that might be a protective factor against certain crimes. So this could be low risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of two. Growing up in a single-parent household is often linked to higher rates of delinquency because there's less supervision and possibly fewer resources. That's medium risk.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can be both protective and risky, depending on how it's expressed. If it leads to positive behaviors, it might lower risk, but if she uses it to justify antisocial actions, it could increase risk. Without more info, I'll go with medium.\n\nPutting this all together: Education and employment are high risks because they're strong predictors of recidivism. Drug use is medium, considering the timeframe. Criminal history is two arrests but no convictions\u2014so maybe not as high as if she had a conviction. Age is medium. Living situation is medium, and religiosity is medium.\n\nSo each of these factors would have a medium weight. There's also the factor about drug use, which might be medium because it's recent enough to influence behavior but not too current. The lack of education and employment are definitely high.\n\nIf I were to predict, I think there's a moderate chance she'll be rearrested. Maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger age may indicate higher risk due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues leading to higher arrest rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"No convictions yet, but two arrests suggest some involvement\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height might influence employment opportunities, less directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack supervision, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education hinders stability, strongly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs held recently can lead to criminal behavior for income\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could influence behavior, though less concerning than addiction\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed may be protective against certain crimes\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household linked to higher delinquency rates\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence could either protect or risk, unclear without more info\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
