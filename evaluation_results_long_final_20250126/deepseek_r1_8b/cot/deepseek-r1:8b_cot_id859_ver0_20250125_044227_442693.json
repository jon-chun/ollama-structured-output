    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood that this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From what I know, younger people are generally higher risk for recidivism because they might have less experience with the criminal justice system and may have shorter time perspectives. So that's probably a medium or high risk factor.\n\nShe's White, but I don't think race has a significant impact anymore legally, so maybe that's not relevant here. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. One arrest isn't a strong indicator on its own, but the fact that she was convicted might mean she has some history that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and weight 165 lbs. I don't see how physical characteristics directly relate to criminal behavior, so maybe low here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. A stable family life can be a protective factor, so that might lower the risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it limits employment opportunities and increases stressors that may lead to criminal behavior. That seems like a medium to high risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job this year. Employment can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of\u72af\u7f6a, so having a job might be a protective factor, maybe low or medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is positive, and mental health issues are often linked to higher recidivism, but since she's not currently depressed, that's a lower risk there.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area. A big family might provide more support, which could be protective, so maybe low.\n\nReligious beliefs regarding God's influence on her life.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nPutting this all together, I think most factors lean towards lower risk, but some like age and education are medium. Employment is low, no current drug use is good, and religious beliefs add another layer of protection.\n\nSo overall, the risk might be medium because she has some protective factors but also some risk indicators like age and lack of education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"one arrest and conviction indicates some history that could lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"height and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_status\", \"low\", \"stable family life can provide support and reduce\u72af\u7f6a risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"lack of education is linked to higher recidivism due to limited opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"having a job provides structure that reduces\u72af\u7f6a risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use decreases\u72af\u7f6a likelihood\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"current lack of depression lowers risk\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"low\", \"large family in rural area may provide support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u56e0\u5b50\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
