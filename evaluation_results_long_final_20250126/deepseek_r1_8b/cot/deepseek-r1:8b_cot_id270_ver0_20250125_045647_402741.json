    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this 18-year-old being rearrested within the next three years. He's had two arrests and convictions, which are pretty clear indicators. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. I know that younger people, especially around this age, have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals who have more life experience and might be more settled. So this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From what I've read, racial factors can influence recidivism, but the impact might vary based on other factors. However, being White doesn't automatically determine his risk, so maybe medium here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted. Two prior convictions mean he has a history of criminal behavior. Each conviction increases the likelihood, especially if it's for similar offenses. So this is definitely high.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. I'm not sure how physical factors play into recidivism directly. Maybe larger individuals might have different circumstances, but without more info, I'll stick with low here since it doesn't seem related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to more unsupervised time, which might increase the chances of getting into trouble again. That seems like a medium risk factor because it relates to environment and supervision.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education is often a positive indicator; being engaged in schooling can reduce criminal behavior. So this is a good sign, maybe low risk here.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might increase the likelihood of criminal activity. Without income, he might have more time or need, leading to higher risk. So medium here because it's a contributing factor but not as direct as things like prior convictions.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor. His recent use within the last year could increase his chances of reoffending. But since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that aspect is lessened, so medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. If he's not currently experiencing depression, it might lower the risk compared to someone who is. So low here because his mental state isn't a current issue.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a big household in an urban environment might expose him to more stressors or different influences. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so this could be medium risk due to environmental factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior if it fosters positive values and reduces delinquency. However, without knowing the strength of his faith, I'm not sure, but maybe low since it's a potential positive factor.\n\nPutting all these together: age is high, prior convictions are high, unemployment is medium, drug use is medium, living situation is medium, education is low, no depression is low, and religiosity is low. So combining them, the overall risk seems moderate to high. But I need to assign each a weight.\n\nWait, maybe I should reconsider some factors. Prior convictions are definitely high. Age is high as well. Drug use in the past four years but not recently\u2014maybe that's medium. Unemployment is medium because it can lead to more time for criminal activities. Living with parents in an urban area might contribute, so medium. Education is a positive, low. No depression is good, low. Religiosity could be low or high depending on how strong his beliefs are.\n\nSo finalizing the weights: prior convictions (high), age (high), drug use (medium), unemployment (medium), living situation (medium). The rest are low. So when combined, these factors point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18-year-old male\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested and convicted twice\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"6'1\\\" 180 lbs\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Never married, lives alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in urban area\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
