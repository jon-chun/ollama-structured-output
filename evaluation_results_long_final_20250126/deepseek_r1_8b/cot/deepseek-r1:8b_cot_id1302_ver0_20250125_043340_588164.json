    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nFirst off, he's a Black male, which is a demographic factor that typically has higher recidivism rates compared to other groups. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and between 150-174 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight affects recidivism, but being within the average range might not be as significant as other factors. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to more opportunity for criminal behavior without supervision. So maybe medium.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can increase social marginalization. That's probably high.\n\nHe has held two jobs this year, which is positive. Stable employment reduces crime risk, so that might be low to medium.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant factor, especially if he's using within the past month. That's definitely high.\n\nHe feels down in the dumps recently, which could indicate emotional instability. Stress can lead to criminal behavior, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four with his biological mother. A large family size isn't inherently risky, but living with a single parent might have contributed to his current circumstances. Maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God plays a role in his life. Religiosity can influence behavior, potentially reducing crime, so that's low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like drug use and lack of education are the most significant contributors. His employment is positive but may not outweigh other high factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographic_risk\", \"high\", \"Black male demographic contributing to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight not significantly impacting recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk due to lack of supervision\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces criminal behavior likelihood\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly elevates recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"emotional_stability\", \"high\", \"Feeling down may indicate stress leading to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Household size and single-parent background contributes moderately to risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may reduce crime likelihood through religious influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
