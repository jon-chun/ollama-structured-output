    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 19-year-old male being rearrested within three years. Let me start by looking at each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old, which is relatively young in terms of criminal history. That might mean he's less established in criminal behavior, but it could also mean he's more likely to engage in risky activities as he's seeking identity or status.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and I know that certain demographic factors can influence risk. Studies show that being Black often correlates with higher arrest rates, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That suggests he might have some familiarity with the criminal justice system, which could either be a deterrent or encourage further behavior. I'm leaning towards medium here because it's not nothing, but it's not a strong history either.\n\nHis physical description: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Not particularly tall, and his weight isn't specified as overweight or underweight. Doesn't seem to provide much info, so maybe low impact.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate he has more freedom to engage in criminal activities without oversight. That could be a medium factor since it affects his environment.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a risk factor; those without further education are sometimes more likely to engage in crime. This is probably a medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the year, which shows he has some stability. Stable employment often correlates with lower criminal activity, so this could reduce his risk. That makes it a low factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs lowers the immediate risk of certain crimes, and not feeling depressed might mean he's mentally stable. Both are positive signs, so that's low risk.\n\nHe didn't grow up in a large household\u2014household size was two. Smaller households might offer less supervision or support, which could be a medium factor as it relates to potential influences towards crime.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life personally. Religiosity can play a role in behavior; without that influence, there might be fewer deterrents, making this another medium factor.\n\nPutting all these together, each of the factors is either medium or low, but none are high. The prediction would lean towards 'NO' for rearrest, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors like having been arrested before and living alone could still pose moderate risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The person is a young adult, which may not establish a strong criminal history yet.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often have higher arrest rates according to studies\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction indicates some exposure to legal system\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"No specific physical traits that indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may offer more freedom for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without further education may correlate with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Two jobs indicate stability, reducing criminal risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use lowers immediate substance-related crime risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed and no drug use indicates mental stability\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Smaller household may lack supervision or support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God may reduce deterrents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
