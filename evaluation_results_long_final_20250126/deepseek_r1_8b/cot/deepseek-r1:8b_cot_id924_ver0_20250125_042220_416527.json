    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign weights to these risk factors for a criminal justice risk assessment. The person in question is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which already makes me think he has some history that could lead to recidivism. \n\nHe's 5'8\" and 160 lbs\u2014doesn't seem particularly concerning physically. Never married and living alone now, which might mean he doesn't have the support system of a family, which can be a risk factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED is a big red flag because education is linked to lower recidivism rates. He's holding two jobs, which on one hand is positive, showing some responsibility, but maybe it's not enough if he hasn't completed his education.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine are pretty common, but regular use can increase the risk of criminal behavior. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate he's managing his mental health, but substance abuse can sometimes mask underlying issues or lead to other problems. \n\nAt a young age, living with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area\u2014large families, especially in rural settings, might have different dynamics, and family support could influence behavior. He doesn't believe in God's involvement in his life, which is an interesting point because religious beliefs can play a role in rehabilitation.\n\nLooking at the factors, I think education is a major one here. Without a diploma or GED, he's less likely to have job stability or other supports that reduce criminal behavior. Family support from a large household could be positive, but it might not outweigh other factors like substance use and past convictions.\n\nHis employment seems stable, which is a good sign, but combined with his lack of education, maybe it doesn't provide enough structure. Substance abuse is another high factor because drug use itself can lead to criminal behavior, including recidivism. His past arrests and convictions are definitely high risk indicators.\n\nThe living situation with a large family could be medium, as extended families might offer some support but not enough to negate other higher risks. His current lack of depression might lower the risk slightly, but substance abuse often co-occurs with mental health issues, so it's a bit tricky. \n\nPutting this all together: education low, family medium, employment high (because he's holding jobs), substance use high, criminal history very high. So maybe each factor is weighted accordingly. Based on these thoughts, I think the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence because multiple high-weight factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"The person lacks a high school diploma or GED, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism as education is linked to better outcomes\"),\n    (\"Family Support\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household with family support may provide some protective factors, though the impact is lessened by other higher-weighted risks\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Having held 2 jobs demonstrates responsibility but lacks the stability that comes with education and furthering career opportunities\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"very high\", \"Arrests and convictions indicate a clear pattern of criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
