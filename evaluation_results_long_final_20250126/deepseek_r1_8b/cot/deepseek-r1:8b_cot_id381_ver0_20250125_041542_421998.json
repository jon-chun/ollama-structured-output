    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male applying for a position where they might be involved in criminal justice. The goal is to determine if there's a high likelihood he'll be rearrested within three years.\n\nFirst, looking at his demographic factors: He's a White male, single, living alone, and has a college enrollment. Being 6'1\" and 155 lbs doesn't immediately raise any red flags. Having a job shows some responsibility, which is positive.\n\nHis criminal history is minimal\u2014only one arrest without a conviction. No prior convictions are a good sign, but the fact that he's been arrested once could indicate some involvement in the justice system, possibly increasing risk slightly.\n\nSubstance abuse is another factor. He has used marijuana recently and felt down in the past month. While marijuana use isn't the most severe, it does contribute to recidivism. His emotional state might make him more prone to stress-related behavior, which could lead to further issues.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a large household in a rural area with both biological parents suggests he had a stable upbringing, which is protective. However, his current mental state and potential stressors from school or work could impact his behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: He attributes personal events to God, which might provide a sense of purpose or coping mechanism. If this helps him avoid criminal activity, it's a positive factor, but if he's using religion as an excuse for poor choices, it could be a risk.\n\nLooking at these factors together, substance abuse and recent emotional distress are high risks. His clean record and stable upbringing might mitigate some risk, but the arrest history, age, and potential stressors could mean medium to high likelihood of recidivism. Overall, I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the justice system, which can be a risk factor for future rearrests\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age (19) is associated with higher risk of recidivism due to immaturity and less developed decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use increases the likelihood of drug-related offenses, contributing to potential rearrest\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the past month may indicate stress or instability that could lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a stable household with both biological parents is protective against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide a coping mechanism or sense of purpose, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
