    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male being rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger people are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they might have less experience with the criminal justice system and could make poor decisions. So, I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as Black. Research shows that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, but it's important to note that his race alone isn't a direct indicator of recidivism without other factors. However, I should consider if there are systemic issues that might influence his chances. Maybe this is medium risk because while race can be a factor, individual circumstances matter more.\n\nHe hasn't been arrested before but has been cited for an arrest. That's interesting because it shows he's come into contact with the system without a conviction yet. This could mean he's at higher risk if he continues on a path that leads to more serious issues.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 165 lbs, which isn't particularly notable, so I don't think this contributes much to recidivism risk. Probably low here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he lacks supervision or support, which could increase his risk because he has more freedom to engage in risky behaviors. So maybe medium for this factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so having a GED and being in college suggests he's working towards stability, which could reduce his risk. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the past year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which are protective factors against recidivism. So this is likely low.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years but felt down recently. This recent downturn might indicate stress or other issues that could lead to criminal behavior. It's a concerning factor because lack of substance use doesn't guarantee lower risk if there are other problems, so maybe medium here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable environment can buffer against risk factors, but since he's now facing potential issues, it might not be as protective anymore. Maybe low.\n\nHe believes in God and considers religion important. Religious beliefs can provide social support and moral guidance, which are protective. So this is probably low.\n\nPutting all these together: age (high), race (medium), prior contact with the system (maybe medium if arrest history is a factor despite no conviction). Arrest history itself isn't a direct indicator without more info on charges, but given he's been arrested, it might lean towards medium or high. Employment (low), education (low), living situation (medium), substance use (medium), family background (low), religion (low).\n\nI think the main high factors are age and possibly arrest history. The other factors are more moderate. So overall risk is medium to high.\n\nNow, predicting a YES with 70% confidence because while there are some protective factors like education and employment, his recent emotional state and lack of substance use might not fully counterbalance potential risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"older individuals often have less experience with the criminal justice system and may be more prone to recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, but individual circumstances play a larger role\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"contact with the system could indicate higher risk despite no conviction\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"stable employment provides structure and stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"higher education attainment is associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"living alone may lack supervision, increasing potential for risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"lack of recent substance use doesn't guarantee low risk without other factors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing can buffer against risk factors despite current issues\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
