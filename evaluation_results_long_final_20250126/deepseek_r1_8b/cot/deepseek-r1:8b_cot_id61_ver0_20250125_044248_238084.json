    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographics: he's Asian/Pacific Islander, which might influence cultural factors or community ties, but without more info, it's hard to say if that's a high, medium, or low risk factor. Then he's 6'1\" and 160 lbs, which isn't particularly unusual, so maybe that's a low factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone could mean he has less supervision or support, which might be a medium risk. His education: high school diploma and enrolled in college, which is positive, so that's probably a low factor.\n\nNo job this year, which could indicate instability or lack of structure\u2014maybe a medium risk. Past drug use (marijuana) in the last four years. Recurrent drug use can be linked to higher risk, so high there. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, so that's low.\n\nHe grew up with both parents in an urban area. Urban backgrounds might expose him to more stressors or opportunities for crime, but this is speculative\u2014maybe medium. He believes in God's influence on his life, which could provide a sense of purpose or deterrence, so that's a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like drug use (high), living alone (medium), no job (medium), urban background (medium). The others are mostly low. So overall, the risk is medium confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"6'1\\\" and 160 lbs\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, lives alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs during the year\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in urban area\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence on his life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
