    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman who's been arrested once and convicted. She's Black, 5'0\", 110 lbs, never married, living alone, didn't finish high school, not in college, held one job last year, hasn't used drugs in four years, felt down sometimes recently, grew up in a big household, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, her race is Black. I know that statistically, Black individuals often face higher rates of incarceration and rearrest. So that's a factor that might increase the risk.\n\nShe has a criminal history\u2014arrest and conviction\u2014which directly points to higher recidivism risk. Prior convictions are a big indicator.\n\nShe didn't graduate high school or get a GED. Lack of education is linked to higher crime rates because it limits job opportunities, leading to economic stress which can contribute to criminal behavior again.\n\nUnemployment can also be a factor here. She held one job last year, but not currently enrolled in college or employed\u2014though she did hold a job, that might still indicate some instability or lack of consistent income, which could increase risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive because drug use is a known driver of crime and recidivism. So this is a good sign, reducing her risk compared to others.\n\nShe felt down sometimes recently. Depression or emotional struggles can lead to higher criminal behavior because people might act out when they're not coping well mentally. This could be medium risk.\n\nHer large household growing up\u2014household size of 6. Big families might have different dynamics that could contribute to delinquency, but I'm not sure if this is a strong factor on its own. Maybe low or medium?\n\nShe believes in God. Religiosity can sometimes be protective against crime, but it's unclear how strong this effect is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Black (high), criminal history (high), education (low), employment (medium?), drug use (low), depression (medium), family size (maybe low or medium). \n\nI think the biggest factors are race and criminal history, each being high. Education and employment are also important but perhaps medium. Depression is a significant emotional factor, so medium. Family size might be less impactful, maybe low.\n\nSo assigning weights: race (high), criminal history (high), education (low), employment (medium), drug use (low), depression (medium), family size (low). \n\nBased on these factors, the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" for rearrest in three years. Confidence is around 75 because while there are strong risk factors, some are medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals have higher rates of incarceration and rearrest\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"prior arrest and conviction increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"lack of diploma limits opportunities, contributing to potential crime\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"unstable job history can lead to economic stress\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no recent drug use reduces some recidivism factors\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"emotional struggles may increase criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"large household might have different dynamics but less direct impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
