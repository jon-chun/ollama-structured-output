    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. He's Black, 6'1\", weighing between 175-199 lbs. He's single, living alone, enrolled in school, no job, used marijuana in the past four years, not feeling depressed recently. At a young age, he lived with his mom in an urban area of five people. He also believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes.\n\nFirst, I should break down each factor and assign weights. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Race: Black male. I know that being Black often correlates with higher arrest rates, so this is a high risk factor.\n2. Criminal history: He's been arrested twice and convicted, which suggests he has a history of antisocial behavior. That's definitely high.\n3. Age: 19 years old. Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, so that's medium-high.\n4. Living situation: Growing up in a large urban household might mean exposure to more crime or dysfunctional environments, so this is medium.\n5. Current employment: He hasn't held a job, which could indicate instability and higher risk of recidivism. Medium-high.\n6. Drug use: He used marijuana recently. Drug use is a significant factor linked to criminal behavior, so high.\n7. Mental health: Not feeling depressed. If he were experiencing depression, it might increase risk, but not feeling it doesn't necessarily lower it. Maybe low or medium.\n8. Education: Enrolled in school, which can be protective. So maybe medium-low.\n9. Faith: Believes in God's influence on his life. Faith-based beliefs could sometimes be protective, so maybe low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the highest risks are race, criminal history, age, drug use, and employment status. The lower ones are education and mental health. So, overall, I think he has a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black male statistically associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium_high\", \"Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to crime-prone environments\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium_high\", \"Lack of employment stability increases risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may not directly correlate to recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium_low\", \"Enrolled in school can be protective\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence might offer some protection\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
