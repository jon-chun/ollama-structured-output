    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assign weights to these risk factors for a recidivism prediction. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they might make poor decisions or get caught up in the criminal justice system more frequently. So I'd say this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he's White. From what I know, racial factors can influence outcomes, but it's tricky because sometimes it's conflated with socioeconomic status. Still, studies show that being White might not be as significant here as other factors like age and criminal history.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted before. That's a good sign. People with no prior convictions are less likely to reoffend. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight aren't provided, but I can infer that being taller or heavier might reduce the likelihood of conflicts or easy escape from situations, which could lower recidivism. Not sure about assigning a weight here though.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Having a stable family life is a strong protective factor. This should definitely be low risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED but not in college. Lack of education can increase criminal involvement as people might turn to crime for opportunities. So this could be medium to high risk depending on other factors.\n\nHe's held two jobs, which indicates he has some stability. Employment is a protective factor, so that should be low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. Staying clean and mentally stable are big positives. Both of these are very low risk factors.\n\nHe lived with his mother in a rural area when young. Growing up with a single parent might increase the risk, especially if there were other issues in the household. But without more info, maybe it's medium.\n\nReligious beliefs about God's influence on personal events could be a protective factor as it might encourage positive behavior. So that's probably low risk.\n\nPutting this all together, age is definitely high. Criminal history is low since no convictions. Lifestyle factors like employment and no drugs are also low. The only slightly higher ones are education and family background. So overall, I think the prediction leans towards \"NO\" with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Racial factors can influence outcomes but may be conflated with socioeconomic status\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No prior convictions suggest lower likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\" employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable employment is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education can increase criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Marriage provides stability and reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No drug use in past four years is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Not feeling depressed recently is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up with a single parent may increase risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Religious beliefs can encourage positive behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
