    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this 18-year-old male will be rearrested within the next three years. He's been arrested twice before and has a conviction record. That seems like a strong indicator of higher risk. He's Hispanic and identifies as such, which might contribute to social or systemic factors affecting his chances.\n\nHe's only 5'5\" and 130 lbs., which isn't particularly tall or overweight, but I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism. Maybe it relates more to health or behavior choices, like substance use.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Not having a stable family structure could increase his risk because he might lack support systems. Being single and living alone might mean he has fewer resources or accountability mechanisms in place.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant predictor for criminal behavior, as it limits job opportunities and increases the chances of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which is positive because employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and income. However, he's also used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down or hopeless recently. Current substance use is a high risk factor, even if it's just marijuana. His mental state could contribute to criminal behavior as he might be more susceptible to stress-related issues.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of nine people in an urban area. Big families can have different dynamics, but I'm not sure how that directly impacts recidivism without knowing more about family influence or support. However, urban areas often have higher crime rates and limited resources, which could play a role.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his life, which might give him a sense of purpose or moral framework. Religion can sometimes deter criminal behavior by instilling values, but it varies individually.\n\nPutting this all together: arrest history is high risk, substance use is high, lack of education is medium, living situation and employment are low to medium positive factors, mental state is medium negative, and religion is maybe a mitigating factor. Overall, the factors point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
