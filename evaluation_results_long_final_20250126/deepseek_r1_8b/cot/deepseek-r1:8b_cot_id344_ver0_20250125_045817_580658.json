    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one and assigning a weight.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is on the younger side. Research suggests that younger offenders have higher recidivism rates because they might be less deterred by potential consequences. So, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nNext, she's White, but race alone isn't a strong predictor in criminal justice systems globally. However, in some contexts, it can correlate with systemic issues, but without more data on her specific circumstances, I think \"medium\" is appropriate.\n\nShe has no criminal history\u2014arrested once but not convicted. A clean record usually lowers risk, so that's \"low\".\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 180 lbs. Body size can affect physical control during crimes, though it's subjective. Since she doesn't have a history of violence, I'll go with \"low\".\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014living alone might mean more access to opportunities for criminal behavior or isolation leading to stress, which could contribute to recidivism. So, maybe \"medium\".\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education levels can influence employment stability, which affects crime rates. Without higher education, this is another factor pointing towards higher risk, so \"high\".\n\nPast drug use\u2014she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it often leads to criminal behavior. So, definitely \"high\" here.\n\nFamily background: she grew up with both parents in a large household in a rural area. Family structure can influence resilience. A big family might provide more support or different environments. Not sure how this affects risk, so maybe \"low\".\n\nHer religious beliefs about God's involvement could be a protective factor if it helps her make positive choices. So, that's \"low\".\n\nEmployment history: held 9 jobs in a year. Stable employment is usually good, indicating she has structure and responsibility. This would lower the risk, so \"low\".\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weighted factors are age (high), past drug use (high), and education level (high). These seem to be the strongest contributors. The rest have lower weights.\n\nNow, predicting rearrest: high from age + high from drugs + high from education = medium overall risk? Or does the sum of high factors make it high? I think it's a bit nuanced, but considering her substance abuse and lack of education are major red flags along with being young, she's likely at a higher risk. So prediction is \"YES\".\n\nConfidence: The combination of high-weighted factors suggests she's moderately to highly likely to reoffend. Maybe around 70-80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age increases likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"correlation with systemic issues but not direct predictor\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"no prior convictions, clean record\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"physical control isn't a significant factor here\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"isolated living may contribute to stress or recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"lack of higher education can lead to instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"large family in rural area doesn't directly correlate with risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"protective factor if promoting positive choices\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"stable employment indicates lower risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
