    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. He's living alone, enrolled in school, holding a job, not using drugs, and hasn't felt depressed recently. He comes from a rural background with both biological parents, and he doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, I should consider each factor one by one. Age is 18, which is relatively young. In terms of age and criminal history, a single conviction might be low risk because it's his first offense. History of drug use is nil for the past four years, so that's positive. No recent depression suggests lower mental health risks.\n\nHe's enrolled in school and holding a job, indicating he has structure and responsibilities. Living alone could mean he lacks supervision but also possible stability. His family background is stable with both parents, which is a positive factor. Belief system doesn't tie into criminal behavior directly, so that's neutral.\n\nComparing to others his age, someone with no prior issues except one conviction might have lower risk. But I should weigh how each factor contributes. Maybe factors like age and lack of criminal history are low, work and education as medium positive, family background also medium positive. Drug use absence is high positive, but depression isn't relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got a clean bill so far, structure through work and school, no drug issues, stable family. So the prediction might be \"NO\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age may contribute to lower risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Single conviction suggests low risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in past four years reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers mental health risk\"),\n    (\"education_work\", \"medium\", \"Employed and enrolled in school adds stability\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could be neutral or positive if stable\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Strong family support may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief doesn't directly impact risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
