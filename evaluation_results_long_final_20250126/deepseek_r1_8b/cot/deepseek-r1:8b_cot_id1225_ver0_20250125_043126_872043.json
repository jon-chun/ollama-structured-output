    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weights for each risk factor in this case. Let's see, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. He has one arrest and conviction. His height and weight are average but not particularly notable. He hasn't worked in a year, which might be concerning because stable employment can reduce recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't use drugs anymore, which is positive. He's not depressed recently either, so mental health isn't a current issue. Growing up in a big household in a rural area might mean he had some support or maybe learned certain behaviors from his family.\n\nReligiously, he doesn't believe in God, which could affect his coping mechanisms. Now, considering risk factors for recidivism: criminal history is a significant factor here because he's been arrested and convicted once, so that's probably high. Age can also influence; being 21 is on the younger side but not too low.\n\nRace might be a medium factor because some studies show disparities, though it's tricky as other variables also play in. Living situation\u2014since he's living alone now\u2014is another consideration. Employment is a big one; no job means less stability. Drug use is low because he hasn't used in four years, so that's positive.\n\nMental health isn't an issue here, so that's low. Family background could have either a low or medium impact depending on the specific family dynamics. Belief system\u2014without religious ties, maybe that's medium as it affects social support.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest weight is criminal history, then age, race, living situation, and employment. The prediction leans towards YES with high confidence because of the conviction and other factors like unstable living and lack of work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger age can be both a risk and protective factor; he might still be in a developmental phase\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Research shows racial disparities in recidivism rates, but this needs to be considered alongside other factors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone could increase risk due to lack of support and supervision\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: No stable employment increases risk as it provides structure and financial stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No drug use in the past four years is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Not feeling depressed is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large household might influence behavior patterns and socialization\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of religious belief may affect coping mechanisms and social support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
