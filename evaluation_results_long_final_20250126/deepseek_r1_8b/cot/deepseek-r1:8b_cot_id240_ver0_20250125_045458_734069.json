    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person and predict if they'll be rearrested in the next three years. Let's start by looking at each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. That's relevant because age can influence behavior patterns, and being Hispanic might have cultural or systemic factors affecting arrest rates. I'm not sure if it's medium or high yet, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. One arrest isn't a strong indicator on its own, so maybe it's low risk in terms of past behavior. But sometimes an arrest can indicate higher risk if there's a pattern, but since he hasn't been convicted, it might be lower.\n\nHis physical stats: 5'9\" and 215 lbs. Not sure how that ties in, but being overweight could correlate with health issues or other behaviors that might increase crime risks. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 is common, but sometimes living alone can be a risk factor if it leads to more time for criminal activities. So maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Being educated is usually a protective factor, so this might lower his risk compared to those without education. Maybe low here.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but only having one job doesn't show strong ties to the community or means of support. So maybe medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of substance abuse is positive, and mental health issues are often linked to higher crime rates. So no depression could mean lower risk here\u2014maybe low.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area when young. Growing up in a big family might provide more supervision or support, which can be protective. But being in an urban area is often associated with higher crime rates, so maybe that's a medium factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with personal events. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it might influence behavior towards more prosocial activities. So this could lower the risk\u2014maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting it all together, some factors like education and no recent depression point towards lower risk, while living in an urban area and having arrest history might increase it. Overall, I think the risk is moderate, so maybe medium confidence predicting a 'NO' for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic identity may influence cultural factors and systemic risks\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction may not indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"high\", \"Overweight may correlate with higher risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21 could be neutral or slightly risky\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job shows some stability but not strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression indicates lower risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might influence prosocial behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
