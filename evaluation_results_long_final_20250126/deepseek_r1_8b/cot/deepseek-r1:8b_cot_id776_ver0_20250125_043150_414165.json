    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which could be relevant in terms of demographic factors that might influence recidivism. Now, he's got one arrest and conviction, which is a direct indicator of past criminal behavior. That seems significant, probably medium or high risk.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and 190 lbs, which doesn't immediately ring any bells regarding risk factors beyond the usual. He hasn't been married and lives alone now, but he was raised in a household with both parents in a rural area. I'm not sure how living arrangements impact recidivism, but it might contribute to social support or stress levels.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which are positive indicators. Education can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, so that's probably low risk there. He's held two jobs this year, showing some responsibility, which also points towards lower recidivism risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is a common factor, often linked to higher recidivism rates, so I might rate that as medium or high risk. Not feeling depressed could be a protective factor, counteracting some of that risk.\n\nReligiously, he considers God's influence on his life.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u518d\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u62a4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4f1a\u7ed9\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest and conviction is a significant factor, leaning towards high risk. His education and employment are positives but maybe not as impactful as his criminal history. His drug use is a concern, especially since he's young, so that might be medium.\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u4ed6\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u4e0d\u4f1a\u518d\u88ab rearrest\u3002\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male demographic factors\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"One arrest and conviction\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs, demonstrates responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in rural area\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences his life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
