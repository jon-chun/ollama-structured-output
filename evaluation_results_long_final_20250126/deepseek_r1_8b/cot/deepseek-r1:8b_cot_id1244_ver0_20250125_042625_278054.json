    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this 21-year-old being rearrested in the next three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. I remember that there are disparities in the criminal justice system where certain groups might be treated differently, which could influence recidivism. But I'm not sure if this is a direct indicator or just a correlation. Maybe it's medium since it's a known factor but not entirely clear on its impact.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. That seems positive. People who are arrested but not convicted might have better outcomes, so that could be low risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 148 lbs. I'm not sure how physical factors tie into criminal behavior, but maybe being smaller or lighter doesn't contribute much. Probably low here.\n\nNever been married and lives alone. Some people who live alone might have more time for trouble-making, but it's also common and not necessarily a red flag. Maybe medium because living situation can affect decisions.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education is important; having a diploma could be protective. Not being in college might mean less supervision or structure, so maybe medium risk.\n\n Held two jobs last year. Employment is usually seen as a positive indicator. Being able to hold down a job suggests better stability and lower likelihood of crime. So this should be low.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is great because substance abuse is a big factor in recidivism. Also, not feeling depressed could indicate better mental health, so that's another positive. Both factors might contribute to lower risk.\n\nReligious belief involving God. Religion can be a stabilizing factor. Believing something higher might reduce impulsive behavior. So this is probably low risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of five. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and large households might not have provided much supervision. Also, single-parent households can sometimes lead to different outcomes. This seems like a medium risk factor because the environment could influence behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: race (medium), arrest history (low), height/weight (low), living situation (medium), education (medium), employment (low), substance use and mental health (low), religion (low), family background (medium). \n\nAdding these up, I think there's a moderate risk. Maybe around 60% confidence that he'll be rearrested in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggests lower likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical factors like height and weight are not directly linked to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could contribute to higher risk, but it's also common\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not in college might increase risk compared to those with further education\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs indicating stability and lower criminal propensity\"),\n    (\"substance_use_mental_health\", \"low\", \"No drug use and no depression indicate better mental health\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can reduce impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may increase exposure to negative influences\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
