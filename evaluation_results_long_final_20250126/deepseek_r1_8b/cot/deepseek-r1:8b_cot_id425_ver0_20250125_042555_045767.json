    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male being rearrested within the next three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographics: he's a White male, 5'8\", 160 lbs. Not married and living alone. That could indicate some independence but might also mean less supervision or support systems in place. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Limited education can be a significant risk factor for recidivism because it's harder to find stable employment and may lead to more criminal opportunities.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests he might have some familiarity with the justice system. That could mean he knows how to navigate around consequences or has learned from his previous experience, though it's just one arrest without a conviction.\n\nHis past substance use includes marijuana in the last four years. While not all drug use leads to criminal behavior, frequent use can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like theft or violence to support habits. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mitigate some risks associated with substance use.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year, indicating some work stability. Employment can be a positive factor by providing structure and financial stability, reducing the need to commit crimes for money. On the other hand, if he lost his job, that could increase risk.\n\nHis upbringing was in a large urban household with both biological parents. Growing up in an urban area might expose him to more crime and antisocial influences, which could contribute to higher recidivism rates. But he also lived with both parents, which might have provided a supportive environment.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the role of religion in his life. Without any spiritual or religious ties, he might lack some support systems or moral frameworks that could otherwise deter criminal behavior.\n\nLooking at all these factors, his age is 18, which is relatively young and often associated with higher risk-taking behaviors. His educational status and lack of employment beyond two jobs are concerning. The past substance use adds another layer, but the lack of depression might help a bit.\n\nConsidering each factor's weight: education and employment are probably high because they directly impact life stability. Substance use could be medium since it's a known risk factor. His family background is urban, which is a significant risk, so that's also medium. Belief system is less impactful but still adds some risk, maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, his risk of rearrest seems moderate to high. He has some factors working against him but also a couple of positives like employment and not being currently depressed. However, the lack of education and urban background are strong indicators of higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Limited education makes it harder to find stable employment and increases criminal opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs, indicating some stability but could be lost leading to higher risk\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents may expose to crime influences\"),\n    (\"Belief System\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief might reduce moral deterrence but has less impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
