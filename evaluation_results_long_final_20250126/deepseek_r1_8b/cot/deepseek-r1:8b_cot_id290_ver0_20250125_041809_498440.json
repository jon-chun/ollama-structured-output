    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who hasn't been convicted but has a history of arrest. Let me start by breaking down each part of her background.\n\nFirst off, she's Black, which might relate to systemic issues in the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect minorities. That could be a medium factor because it ties into higher rates of incarceration and recidivism often seen in certain demographics.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college, which makes me think about educational attainment. Not having further education might increase her risk since studies show lower education levels correlate with higher crime rates. So that's another medium factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might contribute to criminal behavior, so that's probably a high risk factor because job instability is linked to recidivism.\n\nHer drug use history is only marijuana in the past four years. Recurrent substance abuse can lead to criminal charges, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's lower than if she had more serious drug issues. Still, past drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so medium.\n\nShe doesn't feel depressed over the past month, which might indicate she's not currently dealing with mental health issues that could contribute to criminal behavior. That's a low factor because current mental health isn't a concern here.\n\nLiving in an urban area with her mother as a child is another point. Growing up in a big city can expose someone to more crime and antisocial influences, which might increase recidivism risk. So medium there.\n\nShe considers God involved in her life, which could be a protective factor. Religious beliefs sometimes reduce criminal behavior, so that's low.\n\nNot being married and living with others might mean she has less accountability or support, but it's not as high as unemployment or lack of education. Maybe medium.\n\nSo putting it all together: age is 22, which is young but not extremely high risk. She hasn't been convicted yet, which is a good sign, so that lowers the probability. Her current mental health seems stable, which helps. But her unemployment and educational status are significant issues. The fact that she has only used marijuana could be better than more serious drugs.\n\nI think the factors leaning towards medium to high would be unemployment, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, living situation, and substance abuse. Mental health and religious beliefs are low factors.\n\nBased on these, I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with moderate confidence because while there are some protective factors like stable mental health and belief systems, the lack of education, job, and exposure to urban issues increase risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues in the criminal justice system which can lead to higher rates of incarceration and recidivism\"),\n    (\"educational_attainment\", \"medium\", \"Low education levels are associated with higher crime rates due to limited opportunities and stressors\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can increase stress and contribute to criminal behavior as individuals may feel compelled to engage in illegal activities for survival\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism, though it may not be as severe as more serious drug issues\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a large family can expose individuals to more crime and antisocial influences\"),\n    (\"religion/spirituality\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as protective factors reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not being married may increase risk due to lack of accountability and support structures\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Stable mental health is a protective factor that reduces recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
