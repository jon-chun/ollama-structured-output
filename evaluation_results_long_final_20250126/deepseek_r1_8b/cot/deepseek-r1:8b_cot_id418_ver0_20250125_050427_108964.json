    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20, which is relatively young and may indicate higher impulsivity or less experience with decision-making, so that's a medium risk.\n\nHe's Asian/Pacific Islander, but I don't have specific data on how this demographic correlates with recidivism. It might be low since there isn't any negative trend mentioned.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted before, which is a positive sign. People without prior convictions are less likely to reoffend, so that's medium.\n\nHis height and weight are within average ranges for men his age, but I don't see how this directly affects risk. Probably low.\n\nLiving alone might mean he has more freedom, which could increase risk. Being in a large household as a child might have provided more supervision, so now being alone is a concern. Medium to high risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and is not in college, which could indicate he's not anchored by responsibilities like family or education. This could be medium risk since it suggests possible instability.\n\nHe has held one job, which is positive as employment can reduce recidivism. So that's low risk.\n\nHis drug use includes marijuana and cocaine, which are serious drugs. Recent use within the past four years increases risk, so high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a good sign because depression often correlates with criminal behavior. So low risk there.\n\nReligious beliefs might influence his decisions. If he believes God plays a role in his life, it could deter him from criminal activities, so that's medium.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the highest risks are drug use and living alone. Without prior convictions but considering his situation, I'm moderately confident he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may contribute to higher impulsivity\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"General demographic without specific data on recidivism\"),\n    (\"no prior convictions\", \"medium\", \"No history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Within average range for men his age\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone may increase risk of poor decisions\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Has completed high school, not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"One job held suggests some stability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may influence behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
