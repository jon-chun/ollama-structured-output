Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 5'11\" and 153 lbs. That doesn't immediately ring a bell for high risk, but it's not low either. Maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education can be protective, so that might lean towards lower risk. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which suggests some involvement with the criminal justice system. That's a bit concerning, so probably medium.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone now but grew up with his mom in an urban area. Living alone as a young adult could mean more independence, but coming from a single-parent home might have some risks. Maybe medium.\n\nHe has used drugs recently\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor linked to recidivism. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health isn't directly mentioned, but not feeling depressed could be a protective factor. Maybe low or medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: He says God has something to do with his personal life. Religion can sometimes be a protective factor, promoting pro-social behaviors. So that might lower the risk, perhaps medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high-risk factor is drug use. The other factors are mixed but don't outweigh the significant impact of drug involvement. His age and being in college might help, but the arrest history and drug use are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"medium\", \"5 feet 11 inches and 153 lbs\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once and convicted\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Never married, currently living alone; grew up with biological mother in urban area\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with personal outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
