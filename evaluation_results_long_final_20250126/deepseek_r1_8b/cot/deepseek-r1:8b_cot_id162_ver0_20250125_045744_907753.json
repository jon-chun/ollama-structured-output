    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 21-year-old man being rearrested within three years. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me start by looking at each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male. From what I know, race can sometimes be a factor in the criminal justice system, but it's a bit tricky. It might influence things like sentencing or treatment, so maybe that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and 135 lbs. That doesn't immediately jump out as a high risk factor. Maybe his weight is average, so I don't think that's a big issue here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, which might lower the risk of recidivism. So maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college right now. Having an education is usually positive, so that's probably a low risk factor too.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Employment can be a good indicator of stability, which reduces the chances of getting into trouble again. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs and being mentally stable are both positives. No drug use is a strong indicator of lower risk, and not feeling depressed means he's probably managing his mental health well. That's definitely a low factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a big family might have given him some support or structure. While urban areas can sometimes be more crime-prone, having that family background could help him avoid rearrest. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. That's a bit of an unknown factor. Religion can be a source of support, but if it's influencing his decisions in a positive way, it might lower his risk. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting all this together: he's got stable living, employment, no drug use, and some family support. He hasn't been convicted before, which is also a good sign. His belief in religion could be a positive influence. The only thing that might tip it towards higher risk is the urban upbringing, but everything else leans toward low to medium risk.\n\nSo I think each factor except maybe the urban background is low or medium. But since he's been arrested once, even without a conviction, there's still some risk. However, with all the positive factors, I'm leaning towards his chances of rearrest being lower than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
