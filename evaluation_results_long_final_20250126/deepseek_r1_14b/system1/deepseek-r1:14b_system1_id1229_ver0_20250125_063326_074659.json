    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the provided factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old. Juvenile age can sometimes be a factor, but it's not inherently high risk unless other variables are present. Being female might influence risk assessments differently than males, though I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nShe identifies as Black. While race itself isn't a predictive factor, it might intersect with other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues, which could contribute to higher risk. However, I don't have data on that here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, even without a conviction, as they might indicate involvement in illegal activities. But since there's no conviction, it's less definitive. Still, it's something to note.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless they relate to physical altercations or other specific risks, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe hasn't married and is living alone. Living alone could mean she has fewer social supports, potentially increasing risk factors if other issues are present. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher risk for recidivism or criminal behavior, as education is often linked to better opportunities and lower involvement in crime.\n\nShe held 3 jobs in the past year. Employment is generally a protective factor, indicating stability, but moving between jobs frequently might suggest instability or difficulties maintaining consistent employment, which could be a risk indicator.\n\nPast drug use\u2014marijuana in the last four years, and recent feelings of depression. Drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if it's part of a pattern or associated with other high-risk behaviors. Depression is also concerning because mental health issues can increase vulnerability to various risks, including substance abuse relapse or criminal behavior.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 when young might indicate a chaotic home environment, which could contribute to behavioral issues but isn't directly predictive without more information.\n\nBelief that God has something to do with personal events is part of her coping mechanism. While this can be a protective factor (as it relates to resilience), it doesn't necessarily predict risk.\n\nPutting this all together: There are several moderate risk factors\u2014arrest, educational issues, employment changes, drug use, and depression. However, no single factor strongly indicates high risk, and some elements like employment and potential religious coping might mitigate risk. I'm leaning towards a lower confidence level for high risk but not entirely dismissing it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 5. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
