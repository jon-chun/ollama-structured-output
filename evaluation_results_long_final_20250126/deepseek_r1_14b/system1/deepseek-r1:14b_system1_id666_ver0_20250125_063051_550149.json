    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the provided factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18. That's a key factor because younger individuals, especially those just entering adulthood, might be more impulsive or have lower self-control, which can contribute to higher risk.\n\nRace: White. I know that race isn't directly indicative of risk, but it can sometimes intersect with other factors like socioeconomic status or community context, though in this case, there's no explicit info on that.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential future risk because they suggest past behavior that could repeat.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 140 lbs. These stats don't directly indicate risk, but sometimes physical size can influence interactions with others or access to resources, though in this case, it's probably neutral.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor if he lacks community ties, but being unmarried at 18 is normal and not necessarily indicative of higher risk on its own.\n\nEducation: Enrolled in school currently. Education can be protective against future criminal behavior because it provides alternatives and opportunities, so this might slightly mitigate risk.\n\nEmployment history: No jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor as it correlates with idleness and potential involvement in illegal activities for income or due to lack of structure.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a red flag because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior, both as a means to obtain drugs and potentially engage in other illegal activities.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but his lack of depression might reduce that aspect.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with biological parents in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior, though he's currently enrolled in school, so maybe some stability.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is often a protective factor against criminal behavior because it provides a sense of purpose and accountability.\n\nPutting this all together: He has arrests and convictions, recent drug use, unemployment, living alone\u2014these are all higher risk factors. His enrollment in school and lack of depression are somewhat mitigating, but the negative factors seem more impactful. Therefore, I think he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
