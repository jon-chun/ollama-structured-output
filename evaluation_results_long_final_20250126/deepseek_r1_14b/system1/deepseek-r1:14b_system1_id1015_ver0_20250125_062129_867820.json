    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male, which might be a bit of an age where people are still establishing themselves but could also be more impulsive. Being White\u2014race isn't directly a risk factor, so I'll note that but not assign risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, especially if there's no clear pattern of rehabilitation. The fact that he was convicted suggests some level of criminal responsibility.\n\nHeight and weight don't typically predict crime unless they're linked to specific crimes like burglary or assault, which might require physical presence, but I'm not sure how significant this is here.\n\nHe lives alone and hasn't been married. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor if he lacks social connections. No prior marriage might not indicate much on its own unless it's related to family issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests possible educational barriers, which can correlate with higher risk of criminal behavior as education is often linked to better job opportunities and lower involvement in crime.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the past year. This shows some work ethic but could also indicate instability if he's moving from job to job frequently without a stable career path.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana isn't as strongly linked to violent crime, any drug use can be a marker for potential substance abuse issues which might contribute to risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms over the past month is positive; mental health struggles can increase criminal behavior if left untreated, so this is a mitigating factor.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother and one other person. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents or stable family might have some protective factors. However, since he's living alone now and possibly disconnected from that support, it could be riskier.\n\nHe feels God has nothing to do with his personal circumstances\u2014this suggests a lack of strong religious or spiritual connections, which can sometimes act as a protective factor against crime.\n\nPutting this all together: he has some negative factors like prior arrests/convictions, educational barriers, unstable employment, and possible substance use. Positive factors include no depression and having held jobs. The urban upbringing might have some influence but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to say. \n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because there are several red flags but also some positive aspects that could indicate he's trying to stay on the right track.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
