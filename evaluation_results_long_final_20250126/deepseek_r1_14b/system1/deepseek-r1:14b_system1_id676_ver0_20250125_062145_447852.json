    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stable lives and more impulsive behavior, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race alone isn't a determinant of risk, but it might intersect with other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues, though I don't see specific info here.\n\nArrested 22 times and convicted multiple times\u2014that's a significant red flag. Repeated arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior, which is a strong predictor of future criminal activity.\n\nHeight and weight are listed but likely not relevant to risk assessment unless they relate to physical altercations or specific crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe\u2019s never married and lives alone. Lack of stable relationships can sometimes correlate with higher risk, as there's less social support and accountability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment often correlates with lower socioeconomic status and higher involvement in criminal activities. It might limit job opportunities and increase stress.\n\nHe held only one job during the year, which suggests possible instability or inability to maintain steady employment. Unstable work history can be a risk factor as financial strain may lead to criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is another major concern. Substance abuse is frequently linked with higher recidivism rates and involvement in crimes to obtain drugs or commit offenses under influence.\n\nHe\u2019s been feeling down for most of the past month, unable to be cheered up. Depression symptoms can contribute to risk factors by impairing judgment and increasing stress, potentially leading to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of size 2\u2014urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates, but without more info on family dynamics or environment, it's less impactful here.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal happenings. Lack of spiritual support might reduce internal controls and increase reliance on external factors, possibly contributing to risk.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests/convictions, drug use, unemployment, depression\u2014all these are strong indicators pointing towards high risk. The confidence level isn't 100% because there's no info on other factors like current charges, employment stability beyond the past year, or specific offense history. But overall, it's a concerning profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
