    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age is young but not particularly indicative of high risk on its own. Race could be relevant in some contexts, but it's more about other factors here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest a low criminal history, but arrests themselves can still be a factor depending on the context.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'3\" and 230 lbs. Body weight alone isn't typically a risk factor unless it's related to health issues or other behaviors, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean she has less social support, but that's not necessarily a high-risk indicator on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Not pursuing higher education could correlate with lower socioeconomic status, which sometimes relates to risk factors like unemployment or stress.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which might indicate financial instability or lack of employability. Unemployment can be linked to higher crime rates in some studies, though it's not a direct cause.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and recently felt down, even feeling so low that nothing cheered her up. Substance use, especially marijuana, can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, but it's more nuanced. Recent depression symptoms (feeling down) could indicate mental health issues, which might be a risk factor if not addressed.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size 6 with her biological mother in a rural area. Large households and rural settings might present different challenges, such as limited resources or higher crime rates in some areas, but this is speculative.\n\nLastly, she considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This might indicate a lack of religious support or coping mechanisms, which could be relevant if religion is seen as protective against risky behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there are several points that might contribute to high risk: unemployment, recent drug use, depression symptoms, and living alone without social support. However, the fact that she hasn't been convicted despite an arrest and her age being relatively young might mitigate some of those risks. It's a bit mixed, so I'm not entirely sure if it's high risk or not.\n\nI think the confidence level should be moderate because while there are concerning factors, they aren't all strongly indicative of high risk when considered together.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
