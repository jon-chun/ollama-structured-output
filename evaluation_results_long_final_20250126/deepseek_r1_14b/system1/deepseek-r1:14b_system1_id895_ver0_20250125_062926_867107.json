    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. So, first, I need to list out all the provided risk factors and assess each one's impact.\n\nThe individual is a 20-year-old Black male. Age-wise, he's young but past the typical teenage years. Being Black might be a factor in some contexts, though it's important to approach this with sensitivity and avoid stereotypes. However, systemic issues could play a role here.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because prior convictions can indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses.\n\nCurrently 6 feet 6 inches tall\u2014tall individuals might be perceived differently, but height alone doesn't necessarily correlate with risk unless it's in the context of intimidating others or committing specific types of crimes. I don't think this is a major factor here.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Lack of family support can sometimes contribute to higher risk because there's no network providing oversight or assistance. Living alone might mean fewer external influences encouraging positive behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is often linked with lower recidivism rates; without it, he might have limited opportunities and be more likely to engage in criminal activities for survival or income.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment can lead to increased stress, financial strain, and potentially resorting to illegal means of earning money. This is definitely a high-risk factor because it removes a protective element against crime.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't typically as directly linked to violent crimes as other drugs, but any drug use can indicate substance abuse issues which may co-occur with criminal behavior. Recent use within the month suggests ongoing issues.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer him up. Depression or hopelessness is a mental health issue that can contribute to risk factors by impairing judgment and increasing stress levels, potentially leading to more criminal behavior as an outlet or due to desperation.\n\nLived in a household of size 7 when young. Large family size might indicate a lack of individual attention or possibly exposure to negative influences early on. This could be a contributing factor but is somewhat mitigated if the environment was positive, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk because religious involvement often provides a support system and moral framework. However, this alone isn't a strong indicator without other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, unemployment, lack of education, substance use, mental health issues, and living situation are all strong indicators pointing towards high risk. The age is somewhat mitigated but still concerning given the other factors.\n\nI think the confidence level should be moderately high because there are several significant red flags, but not all extreme. Maybe around 70-85%. I'll settle on 80% as a balanced estimate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
