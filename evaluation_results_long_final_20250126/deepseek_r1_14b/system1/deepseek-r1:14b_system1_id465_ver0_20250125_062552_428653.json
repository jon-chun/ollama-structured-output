    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present.\n\nShe's female, and generally, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that might slightly reduce risk.\n\nHer ethnicity is White. I'm not sure if race directly correlates with higher risk in this context, but it's noted for completeness.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions can be a bit tricky; they indicate some level of involvement but no successful prosecution. It might suggest either good legal representation or perhaps the charges were dismissed, which could imply lower immediate risk, but past behavior is still a consideration.\n\nHeight and weight (5'6\", 130 lbs) don't seem relevant to risk assessment in this context, so I'll set that aside.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean she has more independence, but it could also mean fewer support systems if she were to face difficulties. However, without other factors, this isn't a major red flag.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally protective against crime; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. So that's a positive sign.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year, which shows responsibility and stability. Employment is another strong indicator of lower risk because it provides income and structure.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a very good sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for reoffending, so her sobriety over this period is positive.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate current mental health stability. However, past history wasn't mentioned, so if she had prior issues, that could be different.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 3 with adults who were not biological, foster, or adoptive parents, in an urban area. This might suggest a less than ideal upbringing or exposure to environments where criminal behavior could have been modeled. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so this could be a slight risk factor.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can be both protective and sometimes lead to more rigid behaviors, but generally, strong religious ties are associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some positive factors like education, employment, no drug use, and religious beliefs which mitigate risk. The arrest without conviction is a bit concerning but not necessarily a major indicator on its own. The living situation in an urban area with non-parental adults could be a minor risk factor, but overall, the positives seem to outweigh this.\n\nSo my assessment would lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
