    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old, which is a young age but still an adult. He's male and identifies as White. Age can be relevant in terms of life stage; someone just turning 18 might still be transitioning into adulthood, possibly influencing their behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate that the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty, which might suggest the arrest was for a minor offense or perhaps something where there wasn't enough evidence. However, an arrest itself can be a risk factor because it shows some level of law involvement.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs over 250 lbs. His weight is quite high; being overweight can sometimes correlate with other factors like health issues, but in terms of criminal risk, I'm not sure if weight directly impacts behavior unless there are underlying health conditions or social stigma associated with it.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't uncommon, especially if he's independent or from a family that allows him to live on his own. Not being married could mean fewer responsibilities, but it might also indicate some level of instability in relationships.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently, which is a positive sign because education can be protective against criminal behavior. Being engaged in school suggests he has structure and goals, which might reduce risk factors.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs could mean financial stability or the need to work due to economic pressures. It shows responsibility but might also indicate stress if he's juggling several roles without much free time.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, especially when it comes to substance-related crimes or crimes committed under the influence of drugs. However, since he only uses marijuana and hasn't been convicted, this might indicate recreational use rather than problematic abuse.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive mental health indicator. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher criminal risk if left untreated, so his lack of depression could mitigate some risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment, even in an urban setting which might have more challenges, can be protective. Having two biological parents suggests a potentially supportive upbringing, which is generally associated with lower criminal risk.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a strong belief system or spirituality, which can sometimes provide moral guidance and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he's young, has an arrest record but no conviction, is in school, holds jobs, uses marijuana occasionally, and comes from a stable family background with a strong spiritual orientation. The arrest might be a red flag, but without a conviction, it's not as significant. His current involvement in education and employment suggests lower risk. Drug use could be a concern, but again, it's only marijuana.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because of his positive attributes like being enrolled in school, having two jobs, stable upbringing, and strong beliefs. The arrest is somewhat concerning, but without a conviction, and considering he's 18 and might have made youthful mistakes, it doesn't seem to indicate a high-risk pattern.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
