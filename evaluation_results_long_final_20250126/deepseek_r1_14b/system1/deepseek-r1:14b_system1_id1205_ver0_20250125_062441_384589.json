    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the provided factors. Let's break down each point.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age is quite young, but not sure if race affects risk directly here.\n\nShe was arrested once but never convicted. Arrests can be a factor, but without a conviction, it might indicate that the case didn't lead to charges, which could be positive.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless they relate to other factors like physical presence or strength, but I don't see how that's applicable here.\n\nShe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, possibly increasing risk if she faces challenges.\n\nHigh school diploma is good, but not enrolled in college. Unemployment for the year could be a concern as lack of employment might indicate financial stress or limited opportunities.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive; that's a low-risk factor. Not feeling depressed recently is also good.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with her biological mother and two others. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but she was living with family which might provide some stability.\n\nLastly, she doesn't see God as influencing her life. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some, but absence of it might not necessarily increase risk unless other factors are at play.\n\nConsidering all these, there's no strong indication of high risk. Most factors are neutral or slightly positive, especially the lack of recent depression and drug use, along with having a high school diploma. The arrest without conviction is somewhat concerning, but not enough to label as high risk on its own.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
