    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive, but that doesn't necessarily mean high risk.\n\nRace: He identifies as White. While race isn't a direct indicator of risk, it can sometimes play a role in societal factors or access to resources, but I don't have enough info on that here.\n\nArrest and conviction history: Two arrests and one conviction are significant. Convictions often indicate past criminal behavior, which could be a red flag for future risks.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone, which might mean he has less support or supervision, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, but it depends on other factors.\n\nEmployment: He held one job during the year. Steady employment can be a positive indicator, suggesting he's responsible, which might reduce risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is concerning because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior or other risky actions.\n\nMental health: No depression symptoms in the past month. Positive sign, as mental health issues can contribute to higher risk.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment might be protective, but urban areas could have different crime rates.\n\nSpiritual beliefs: He considers God's role in his life. Some studies suggest that strong spiritual beliefs can reduce recidivism, so this might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors pointing towards high risk are the two arrests and one conviction, along with recent drug use. These are significant indicators of potential future issues. However, positive factors like being in college and having a job somewhat mitigate that. I'm leaning towards high risk but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
