    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess this individual's risk factors. So, the person is a 20-year-old White male who's been arrested four times and convicted. That immediately raises some flags because prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential future criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a history of drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and specifically marijuana all month long. Substance abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so that's another point against him.\n\nLooking at his living situation: he lives alone, which might mean less supervision or support. People who live alone sometimes have more freedom to engage in criminal activities without immediate consequences, so that could be a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and has no children mentioned, which might mean fewer family ties to deter him from\u72af\u7f6a. But then again, he did grow up with both biological parents in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but it's not clear if his upbringing directly contributes here.\n\nHis employment history shows he's held five jobs in a year. That could indicate instability or that he's struggling to maintain steady employment. Sometimes, people who are unemployed or underemployed might turn to criminal activities out of necessity or because they're seeking quick money.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. While education can be a factor, it's mixed here because he did complete high school, which is better than not having that diploma. But the lack of further education might limit his opportunities, potentially pushing him towards crime.\n\nHis emotional state: he's been feeling down for the past month, nothing cheered him up. Depression or persistent sadness can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors. It's a significant factor because mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events, which might suggest a lack of strong religious or spiritual support. Religious involvement is sometimes linked to lower crime rates, so the absence here could be another risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, living alone, employment instability, mental health issues\u2014all these factors are pointing towards high risk. The confidence level isn't 100% because some of these might not directly correlate in every case, but collectively they make a strong case for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
