    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 22 years old. That's relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors. \n\nShe identifies as White. Race itself isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior, so I don't think that plays into the risk assessment here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, especially if there's no conviction. However, sometimes arrests happen without convictions, which might mean she didn't engage in serious crimes or was wrongfully accused. It's something to note but maybe not a major factor on its own.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'10\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't see how height or weight directly correlate with criminal behavior, so this might not be relevant.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married could mean she doesn't have the same responsibilities as someone who is, but not living alone might suggest she has a support system, which could be protective against criminal activity.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in a graduate program. Education is usually seen as a protective factor against crime because higher education can lead to better job opportunities and social mobility. So this seems like it would lower her risk.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs might indicate financial instability or perhaps someone trying to build their resume, but it could also show responsibility and the ability to manage different roles, which are positive signs.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, especially if she's involved in drug-related crimes or under the influence of drugs. However, no depression might mean lower mental health issues that could exacerbate other problems.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of 6 in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can have more exposure to crime and negative influences, but living with both parents might provide stability. The size of the household (6 people) could be either positive or negative depending on dynamics, but it's probably less impactful compared to other factors.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs are often associated with lower criminal behavior because they can provide a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting all this together: She has some risk factors like an arrest record and drug use, but also several protective factors like education, employment, living with parents, and religious beliefs. The presence of multiple jobs suggests she's responsible and maybe not relying on illegal activities for income. Her graduate studies indicate a focus on her future.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because the protective factors seem to outweigh the negative ones. However, I can see how someone might argue that drug use could still be a significant factor, but without a conviction or ongoing issues related to substance abuse leading to crime, it's less concerning.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
