    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male, White. Age might be relevant as younger individuals could be at higher risk, but being White might have varying implications depending on data.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can indicate potential behavior, but no conviction might mean it didn't lead to any legal consequences. However, arrest history is still a factor in some assessments.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. These stats don't directly correlate with risk factors unless there's specific data linking them, which I don't recall.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Living arrangement could be a factor\u2014maybe living with others might provide support but sometimes indicates instability if moving frequently or unstable family dynamics.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to recidivism; lower education can correlate with higher risk.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the year. Employment history could be mixed\u2014having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining steady employment, which can be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially frequent in the last month. Drug use is a significant indicator of potential criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer him up. Depression or recent mood issues might indicate stressors contributing to higher risk.\n\nGrowing up with his biological dad in a household of size 3. Family dynamics can influence behavior; living with dad might have specific implications depending on family stability and support systems.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events, indicating possible lack of religious or spiritual support, which sometimes correlates with lower social supports and higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has an arrest record without conviction, no diploma, unstable employment, recent drug use, mood issues, and possibly a lack of strong social support. These factors collectively suggest a high risk for further criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
