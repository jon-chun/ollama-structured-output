    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me start by going through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less life experience, but race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless other factors are present.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he was either innocent or perhaps had legal representation that got the charges dropped. However, arrests themselves can still be a red flag because they indicate potential legal issues or risky behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. His build isn't particularly a risk factor on its own unless it relates to physical altercations or other behaviors, but there's nothing here suggesting that.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the same support system as someone living with family, which could be a slight risk if he lacks social connections. But again, this isn't a strong indicator without more context.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with future stability or criminal behavior, but having a diploma is generally a positive sign. Not being in college might mean he's focused on work, which could be stable.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having steady employment is usually a good indicator of responsibility and lower risk. However, only holding one job doesn't provide much context about his stability or potential stress from work.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. No recent substance abuse is definitely positive. Not feeling depressed also suggests he's not struggling with mental health issues that might contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Growing up in an urban setting can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates, but family stability is usually protective. Having both parents around might mitigate some risks.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates he has a strong belief system, which can provide emotional support and possibly deter him from engaging in risky behaviors due to religious beliefs.\n\nNow, putting this all together: He's young but employed, not convicted despite arrests, educated, living alone, and has a supportive upbringing. His lack of recent drug use and depression is positive. The only potential red flags are the two arrests and living alone without obvious social support. However, these factors don't strongly indicate high risk when considering his stable employment, education, and family background.\n\nI'd say there's a moderate chance he might pose some risk, but it's not extremely high. Maybe around 40% confidence that he is at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
