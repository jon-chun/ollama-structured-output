    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18. That's a young adult, and sometimes people that age are still figuring things out, but being in that range can be a factor in risk assessment because they might have less impulse control or experience.\n\nRace is White. I don't know if race itself is a direct indicator of risk, but it might relate to other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues, though I'm not sure how much weight that should carry here.\n\nArrest and conviction history: he's been arrested once and convicted. That immediately raises some flags because even one conviction can indicate potential for future offenses, especially if there are underlying issues contributing to the arrest.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant in this context unless they relate to physical altercations or specific types of crimes, but I don't think so here.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might mean he doesn't have a strong support system. If he's living alone without family nearby, that could be a risk factor because he might lack guidance or supervision.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior, but if he's not holding a job, that could indicate underemployment or idleness, which is another potential risk factor.\n\nNo jobs during the year: unemployment or underemployment can increase stress and the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity as a means to earn money or cope with boredom.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates and can indicate poor decision-making skills. His drug use might also be a sign of underlying issues like mental health or social environment.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean he doesn't have that particular mental health issue, but substance use can sometimes mask other problems.\n\nLiving in an urban area at a young age with his biological mother in a household of size 2. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and living in such an environment might contribute to exposure to criminal activities. Family dynamics could also play a role if there's any dysfunction or if he's dealing with stressors at home.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be protective, but I'm not sure how strong that factor is in predicting risk behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some red flags like a conviction, recent drug use, and unemployment. However, he's in school and hasn't shown signs of depression. The fact that he's living alone might make him more vulnerable, but his age and education could be protective factors. I'm leaning towards moderate risk because there are both positive and negative indicators, but the negative ones like criminal history and drug use are concerning.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
