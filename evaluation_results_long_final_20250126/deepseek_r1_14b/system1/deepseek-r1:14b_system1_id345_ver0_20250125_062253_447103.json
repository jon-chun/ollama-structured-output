    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if this individual is at high risk for criminal behavior based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male, white. Age-wise, 20 is still relatively young, but not too young as to be excused. His race might not be a direct indicator unless there are other factors, which I don't see here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because a conviction indicates he was found guilty of some offense. It shows past behavior that could predict future actions, especially if the offense is related to risk-taking or rule-breaking.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 128 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly correlate with criminal risk unless it's a factor in confrontations, but that's speculative.\n\nLiving alone without being married could mean less oversight and support, which might increase the chance of engaging in risky behavior. But he has a high school diploma and hasn't been enrolled in college. That might indicate limited education beyond high school, which can sometimes correlate with lower socioeconomic status or fewer opportunities, factors that may contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year, suggesting he might have inconsistent employment. Unstable work history could be linked to financial stressors or difficulty maintaining steady income, potentially leading to illegal activities as a means of livelihood.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as other drugs, any drug use can indicate substance abuse issues, which often co-occur with criminal behavior. It's a risk factor but might be mitigated if it's occasional and not part of a larger pattern.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is important; absence of depression here might lower the risk, as mental issues can sometimes lead to criminal acts as coping mechanisms.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural household of four. Family structure can influence behavior\u2014growing up in a stable home might reduce risk, but rural areas could have different crime patterns or access to resources. The fact that he's from a rural area might mean less exposure to certain influences, but it's not clear.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs are often associated with lower criminal behavior as they provide a moral framework and support system. This could act as a protective factor against crime.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a conviction, which is a strong indicator of risk. His job instability and living alone might increase the likelihood. Drug use adds another layer. However, his stable upbringing, education, and religious beliefs mitigate some of these risks. It's a mix, but the conviction stands out as a significant factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
