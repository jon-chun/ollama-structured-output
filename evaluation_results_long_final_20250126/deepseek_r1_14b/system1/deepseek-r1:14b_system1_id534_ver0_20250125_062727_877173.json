    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point.\n\nHe's a 20-year-old Black male. Age is quite young, which might mean less criminal history but could also be associated with higher risk due to being in an active crime period. His race might be a factor depending on societal context, though it's sensitive.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. An arrest can indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's somewhat mitigated. However, arrests can still signal tendencies.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical stats don't directly correlate with risk unless in specific contexts like gang activity or physical altercations.\n\nUnmarried and living alone. Living alone might reduce some support systems, possibly increasing risk factors if he lacks social networks.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level is moderate, which isn't a strong indicator on its own but combined with other factors could matter.\n\nEmployed at two jobs this year. Steady employment usually lowers risk as it provides structure and income, so this might be protective.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent and frequent. Marijuana use is common but could still indicate potential for other issues or impaired judgment.\n\nReported feeling down recently, even to the point of depression symptoms. Mental health struggles are significant risk factors as they can impair decision-making and increase impulsivity.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and family structure could be protective if the environment was stable, but it's a mixed factor.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs often provide stability and support, which can lower risk by offering coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting this together: The presence of an arrest, recent drug use, mental health issues, and urban upbringing might increase risk. However, factors like employment and religious beliefs could mitigate some of that. I'm leaning towards medium to high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
