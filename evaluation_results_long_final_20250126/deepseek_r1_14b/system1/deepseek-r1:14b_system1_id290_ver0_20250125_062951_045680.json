    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 years old. Young adults can be at a higher risk due to immaturity and potential instability in their lives.\n\n2. **Gender**: Female. While gender can sometimes influence crime rates, it's not the most significant factor here.\n\n3. **Race**: Black. There might be systemic factors or biases to consider, but without specific context, I'll focus on other indicators.\n\n4. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested once but no conviction. A single arrest could still be a red flag if it's recent or for a serious offense.\n\n5. **Height and Weight**: 5'9\" and overweight. No direct link to criminal behavior, so probably not relevant here.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married and not living alone. Living situation might indicate instability if she's with family or others, but without more info, it's unclear.\n\n7. **Education**: GED certificate, not enrolled in college. Lack of higher education could be a risk factor, though not definitive.\n\n8. **Employment History**: No jobs during the past year. Unemployment can correlate with higher crime rates due to lack of income and structure.\n\n9. **Drug Use**: Marijuana use in the past four years. Substance use is often linked to criminal behavior, especially if it's ongoing or recent.\n\n10. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed recently. No indicators of mental health issues here, which might lower risk if other factors were high.\n\n11. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and family dynamics might influence behavior.\n\n12. **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Believes God has a role in her life. This could indicate strong community ties or support systems, which might mitigate risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, the key points are unemployment, past drug use, and living in an urban area. These can be significant indicators of potential recidivism or criminal behavior. However, she hasn't been convicted, and there's no info on the severity of her arrest. Her belief system might also act as a protective factor.\n\nI would rate this as a moderate risk with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
