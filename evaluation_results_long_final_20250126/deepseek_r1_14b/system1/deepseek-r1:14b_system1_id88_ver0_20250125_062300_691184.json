    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Young adults are often in a transitional phase, which can contribute to higher risk-taking behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nRace might not be a significant factor here unless there's systemic bias, but I don't see any indication of that in the data provided.\n\nArrested 10 times and convicted. That's a major red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk for future offenses.\n\nCurrently living alone without being married could mean less social support, which might increase risk factors, but it's not as significant on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests possible educational barriers, which can correlate with lower employability and higher risk. However, he has held one job during the year, so some stability there.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior and can indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nNo history of depression recently, which might mean lower mental health issues contributing to risk, but other factors still matter.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four could imply exposure to negative influences or environments conducive to crime, though it's not direct evidence.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life\u2014this could indicate some form of coping mechanism or possibly lower risk if spirituality is involved, but it's uncertain.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators. Educational challenges and unemployment history (though he did hold one job) add to the concern. Drug use is another significant factor. His living situation and past environment might have contributed to his behavior, but without more context on family dynamics, it's hard to say. The lack of a diploma could limit future opportunities, potentially leading to continued criminal activity.\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially the high number of arrests and convictions, I would lean towards a high risk assessment. However, since he has held a job and no current depression, there are some mitigating factors, but they might not outweigh the strong negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
