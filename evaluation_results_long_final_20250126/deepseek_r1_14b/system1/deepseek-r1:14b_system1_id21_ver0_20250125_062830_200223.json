    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm looking at a 22-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested three times and convicted. That immediately raises some red flags because prior convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college, which might suggest limited educational opportunities or disengagement from formal education. Being married and living with his spouse could be seen as a stabilizing factor, but I'm not sure how that plays into risk assessment without more context.\n\nHis employment history shows he's held one job during the year. Steady employment can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, so this might slightly mitigate the risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has reported feeling down in the dumps recently. Substance use, especially marijuana, is often linked to higher recidivism rates. His recent mood issues could indicate underlying mental health struggles or stressors that might contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 during his youth might point to a crowded environment which could have influenced his behavior or access to negative influences. Also, his belief that God has something to do with personal events suggests he might rely on religion as a coping mechanism, which can be both positive and not directly indicative of risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, possible mental health issues, and a history of substance abuse are significant high-risk factors. While some aspects like employment and marriage could help stabilize him, the negative factors seem more impactful. So, I would lean towards a higher risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
