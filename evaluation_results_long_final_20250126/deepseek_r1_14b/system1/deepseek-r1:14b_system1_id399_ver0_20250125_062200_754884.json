    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old White male. Age might be relevant because younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but being only 19 isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, but they can indicate past misconduct. However, since there's no conviction, it might suggest the charges didn't lead to a guilty verdict, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'7\" and 125-149 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight these stats carry in risk assessment. Maybe more about physical presence but probably not a major factor here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less support or supervision, which could be a risk if he lacks social networks. Being unmarried at 19 isn't unusual, though.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can correlate with higher risk because it might limit job opportunities and increase stress related to socioeconomic status. However, he's held one job during the year, which shows some responsibility but might be unstable if it's only temporary.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance use is a significant red flag, especially harder drugs like cocaine, which are more likely to be associated with criminal behavior or other high-risk activities. Even though he hasn't been convicted, drug use can impair judgment and increase likelihood of recidivism.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important; absence of depression might lower risk but doesn't negate other factors.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 5 when young. Large family size could mean more social support or possibly higher chaos, which might have influenced his behavior. It's a mixed factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective, providing structure and support, but it's not clear how strong this belief is in his life.\n\nPutting it all together: His arrest, drug use, lack of education, and living alone are concerning. However, no conviction, being employed, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. I'm leaning towards high risk because substance use and past arrest are strong indicators, but the confidence isn't very high since other factors aren't severely negative.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
