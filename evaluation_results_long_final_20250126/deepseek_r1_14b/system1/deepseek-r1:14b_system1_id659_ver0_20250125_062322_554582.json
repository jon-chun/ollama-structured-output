    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. That's relatively young, but not extremely so. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, which might be a risk factor, but it's also possible they're still maturing.\n\nGender is female. In general, males have higher recidivism rates than females, but there are exceptions and other factors to consider.\n\nRace is White. Race itself isn't a determining factor, but socioeconomic status and systemic issues can play roles that intersect with race.\n\nShe has been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests, which could indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior. Convictions add weight because they show she's been through the justice system before.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to risk assessment unless there are specific factors related to physical size affecting behavior or opportunities for crime.\n\nMarital status is single, not living alone. Being unmarried isn't necessarily a red flag, but living with others might mean more supervision or support, which could either reduce or increase risk depending on the household dynamics.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, though it's not a direct cause.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Steady employment is generally protective against criminal behavior, so having held a job might be a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't as strongly linked to violent crime, but recent use could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues which may contribute to risk.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. Positive mental health is protective, so that's a good sign.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family structure and support systems are important. Being part of a larger family might offer some support but could also mean more chaos if the family environment was problematic.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers God has nothing to do with her personal life. Lack of religious involvement isn't inherently risky, but some studies suggest that strong religious ties can reduce recidivism rates. So this might be a slight risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHigh number of arrests and convictions is a major red flag. Drug use could contribute to further offenses. However, steady employment and not feeling depressed are positives. Age being 21 might mean she's still developing but has shown a pattern with her past behavior. The urban upbringing could be a factor if there's exposure to more criminal opportunities.\n\nI'd lean towards high risk because of the multiple arrests, convictions, and ongoing drug use despite having some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
