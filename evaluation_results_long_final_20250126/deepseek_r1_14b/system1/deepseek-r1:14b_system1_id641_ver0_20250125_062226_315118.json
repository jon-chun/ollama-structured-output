    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the factors given. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, she's 19 years old and female. Age might be a factor since younger individuals could be more impulsive, but being female might lower the risk compared to males in some cases.\n\nShe identifies as White. I don't know if race is a significant factor here, but sometimes socioeconomic factors tied to race can play a role, though that's more about background than direct risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a red flag because prior convictions often indicate higher risk for reoffending. However, it's just one arrest, so maybe not as high as someone with multiple offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here unless there are specific factors related to physical size in crimes, which I don't think apply here.\n\nShe's living alone and hasn\u2019t been married. Living alone might mean less support system, but it could also indicate independence. Not being married doesn't directly correlate with risk unless other factors come into play.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college, holding 3 jobs this year. That suggests she\u2019s trying to be self-sufficient, which is positive. Having steady employment might actually lower the risk as she's more invested in her current life.\n\nNo drug use in four years, but she felt down some days recently. The lack of recent drug use is good, but feeling depressed could indicate potential stressors that might increase risk if not managed.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but the size of the household (just two people) might mean she had a more stable or less chaotic upbringing. Not sure how this balances out.\n\nShe feels God has nothing to do with her personal events. Spirituality can sometimes be a protective factor, so lacking that might slightly increase risk if she lacks other support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: One conviction is concerning, but other factors like employment and no drug use are positive. Her age is young but not extremely low. The mental health aspect could be a point of concern. I'm leaning towards moderate confidence that she might pose some risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
