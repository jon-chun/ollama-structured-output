    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break down each point.\n\nHe's a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age might not be a big factor here, but being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to immaturity. His criminal history includes one arrest and conviction, which definitely raises risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of future offenses.\n\nHe weighs 240 lbs at 6'1\", which is quite heavy. I'm not sure how weight directly relates to recidivism, but it might be more about health issues or possible social stigma.\n\nUnmarried and living alone\u2014no spouse or family support could mean less accountability and higher risk of relapse into criminal behavior. No high school diploma or GED suggests limited education, which often correlates with lower employability and higher involvement in crime.\n\nHe hasn't held a job for the past year, indicating possible idleness, another red flag for potential criminal activity. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) within the last four years is significant; substance abuse often accompanies criminal behavior. No depression recently might mean he's not dealing with mental health issues that could contribute to crime.\n\nGrowing up in a household of 4 in an urban area\u2014urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that's another factor. Living with his biological mother might indicate family dynamics or possible lack of strong support systems.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious belief can be both protective (lower risk) and sometimes linked to gang involvement or other high-risk behaviors, depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction, unemployment, drug use, living alone\u2014all these factors point towards a higher risk of reoffending. However, no current depression might slightly lower the confidence but not enough to offset the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
