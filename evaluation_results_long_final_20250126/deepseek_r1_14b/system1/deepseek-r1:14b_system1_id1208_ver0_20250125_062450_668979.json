    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze whether the given risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability. His race might influence certain societal or systemic risks, but it's not directly indicative of criminal behavior on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction could indicate a higher risk because past criminal behavior is often seen as a predictor of future offenses. However, since he was only 18 at the time, it might be his first offense, which could somewhat mitigate that risk.\n\nHis physical stats are average\u20146 feet tall and 145 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't contribute much to risk assessment unless they relate to specific crimes, but in this case, there's no indication of that.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone might mean he has fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor as it might lead to isolation or higher stress, potentially increasing criminal tendencies. However, without knowing more about his support network, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked with higher criminal justice involvement because limited education can limit job opportunities and increase susceptibility to criminal behavior. This is a significant risk factor.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having steady employment might be protective, as it provides income and structure. However, holding two jobs could also indicate financial strain or instability if he's juggling multiple roles without consistent success.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014and has experienced depression recently. Substance use can increase criminal behavior, especially when combined with mental health issues like feeling down. The recent depressive symptoms might lower his self-control and increase risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of size 4. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences, which might contribute to higher risk. Family dynamics, especially if there's a history of issues or lack of support, could also play a role.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can be both protective (if it leads to seeking help or positive coping) and potentially isolating if it leads to making decisions based on divine intervention without seeking other supports.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior conviction, lack of education, unemployment issues despite holding two jobs, substance use, recent depression, urban upbringing, and spiritual beliefs that might not provide immediate support but could influence behavior. The most significant factors seem to be the prior conviction, educational status, and current mental health state, which together indicate a higher risk.\n\nI would rate this as a high risk with about 75% confidence because while some factors like employment and living situation are mixed, others strongly point towards potential recidivism or criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
