    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old Black female. Age is relatively young, but being Black might be a factor in some contexts, though it's important not to stereotype.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without convictions.\n\nLiving alone and never married could mean less support system, which might increase risk. No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited education, which often correlates with higher risk factors.\n\nNo job in the past year indicates unemployment, another risk indicator. Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a negative factor, though it's less severe than harder drugs.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower mental health-related risks but other factors still apply. Growing up with her biological mother in a small household could indicate stable upbringing, but living alone now might be isolating.\n\nBelieving God influences her life might affect her behavior, possibly lowering risk if it's a coping mechanism but could be rigid thinking otherwise.\n\nConsidering all these, there are several moderate to high risk factors: arrests, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and living alone. However, no severe factors like prior convictions or severe mental illness are present. So, the overall risk is moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
