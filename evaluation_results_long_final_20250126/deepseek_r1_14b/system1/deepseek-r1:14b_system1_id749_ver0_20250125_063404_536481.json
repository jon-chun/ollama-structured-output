    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in your early twenties can be a time when people are still developing and might engage in more risky behavior. But race isn't typically a factor unless there's systemic bias involved, which I shouldn't consider here. So maybe age is somewhat relevant but not the biggest factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions can sometimes indicate that charges were dropped or dismissed, which might suggest he wasn't a serious threat. But an arrest itself could still be a red flag, especially if it was recent.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so I don't think those play a significant role in risk assessment unless there's something related to physical strength or size, but that doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has less social support, which could be a factor in future behavior, but it's not a direct indicator of risk. Being unmarried at 20 is normal for many people, so I don't see this as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with crime rates, but since he did finish high school, that might slightly reduce the risk compared to someone without a diploma. However, not being in college at 20 could mean different life choices, which might or might not be risky.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having steady employment is usually a positive indicator and can lower risk, as it provides structure and income. But having only one job doesn't necessarily indicate high stability if that job is precarious or temporary.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is definitely a red flag for potential criminal behavior, especially harder drugs like cocaine. Even though marijuana is less severe, any drug use can increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities or risky behaviors. The fact that this has been ongoing over the past four years suggests a pattern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important; lack of depression might mean he's not struggling with that, which could reduce risk. But other mental health issues could still be present and unreported.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of six. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents is generally protective against delinquency. However, the large household size might indicate more complexity in family dynamics that I don't know about.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, as they often provide guidance and support, potentially reducing risky behavior. But this depends on how he applies his beliefs in practice.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest, drug use, urban upbringing, and being young are factors that could indicate higher risk. On the other hand, education, employment, living with parents (even if not now), and religious beliefs might mitigate some of that risk. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because the presence of an arrest and ongoing drug use over four years is concerning. However, without a conviction and having some positive factors like employment and education, it's not the highest possible risk. So I'd say yes, he might be at high risk, but my confidence isn't 100% because there are mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
