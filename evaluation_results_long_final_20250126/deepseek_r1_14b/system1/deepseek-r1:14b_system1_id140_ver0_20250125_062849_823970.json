    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, White. Age might be relevant since younger individuals can sometimes have higher risks, but being in your early twenties isn't necessarily a direct indicator without more context.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses. So that definitely points towards high risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 154 lbs. Physical stats might not have a direct correlation with criminality unless they relate to the type of crime, but in this case, it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being unmarried could mean less stability, but living alone might reduce certain risks if he's more isolated. However, being alone can sometimes lead to higher stress or criminal activity without support systems.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked with higher crime rates because it limits job opportunities and can contribute to cycles of poverty and crime.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. That's positive; employment can be a deterrent against crime as it provides income and structure. However, holding only two jobs might indicate unstable work history or part-time roles that don't provide enough stability.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use is a risk factor, especially if it's recent. Marijuana can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior, though it's less directly linked than harder drugs.\n\nIn the past month, he's felt down, nothing could cheer him up. Depression or recent mood issues can increase risk factors. Stress, mental health issues, and hopelessness are known to correlate with higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment with multiple siblings might contribute to exposure to crime and negative influences. Family structure can play a role; living with both parents or stable caregivers is often protective, but this family setup could have challenges.\n\nConsiders that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This might indicate a belief system that could influence behavior in either positive or negative ways, depending on the context. However, without more info, it's hard to assess its impact.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. His lack of education, unemployment status, drug use, and recent mood issues add to this. While he has held two jobs, which is somewhat positive, other factors heavily outweigh that. The urban upbringing and family dynamics could also contribute. His belief in God might offer some support but isn't sufficient to counter the other risks.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would say there's a high probability of him being at risk. Maybe around 75% confidence because while some factors are positive (employment), they don't outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
