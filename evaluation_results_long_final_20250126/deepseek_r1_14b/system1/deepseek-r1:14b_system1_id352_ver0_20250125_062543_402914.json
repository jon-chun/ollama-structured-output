    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. I'm not an expert, but I'll walk through each point and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst, age is 22\u2014still relatively young, which could mean higher risk-taking behavior. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates, though that's a generalization.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant because they indicate prior involvement with the law, even if only two times. The conviction suggests he was found guilty, so there's a record of successfully prosecuted offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to risk assessment in most cases, but sometimes physical presence might influence interactions or perceptions, though I'm not sure how impactful that is here.\n\nLiving alone without being married could mean fewer social supports, which might be a factor. However, he's enrolled in college and has a high school diploma, so education is on his side\u2014education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe held one job during the year, indicating some stability but not extensive work history. Employment can be a protective factor against crime, but limited employment might not be as strong.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently are positive signs. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for reoffending, so this absence could lower his risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in an urban area at a young age\u2014this might indicate a less stable upbringing or exposure to environments that could contribute to delinquency. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior but isn't definitive.\n\nHis lack of religious belief might not directly impact criminal tendencies, but some studies suggest that strong religious ties can deter criminal activity. Without that, it's neutral in this case.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a couple of strikes against him with prior arrests and conviction, living alone, and past living arrangements in an urban setting. On the other hand, he's educated, employed, not using drugs, and not depressed. The positive factors might mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because the negative factors aren't severe enough to indicate high risk. There are several protective elements, so I'd say \"NO\" for high risk but with a confidence level that isn't too low either\u2014maybe around 60%. So, prediction is NO and confidence at 60.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
