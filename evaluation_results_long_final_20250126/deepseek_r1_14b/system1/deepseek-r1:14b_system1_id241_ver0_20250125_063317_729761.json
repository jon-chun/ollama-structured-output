    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each point systematically.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female, which is a relatively young age but not particularly indicative of high risk on its own. Next, she identifies as White\u2014ethnicity can sometimes be a factor in statistical models, though it's not clear how significant here without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone might slightly increase risk, but the lack of conviction suggests no formal criminal record, which could mitigate that concern.\n\nHer physical stats aren't red flags, so I can probably ignore those. She's never married and lives alone\u2014living alone might mean less support, potentially increasing risk, though at 19, it's not unusual.\n\nShe has a GED instead of a high school diploma, which might indicate educational challenges but isn't directly a risk factor. Not being enrolled in college could be a concern if education is seen as protective, but again, context matters.\n\nShe held one job during the year\u2014consistent employment can be a positive indicator, so this might actually reduce risk rather than increase it.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine is a significant red flag. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates and general criminality risk.\n\nHer recent emotional state: feeling down for most of the past month to the point where nothing cheered her up suggests possible depression or other mental health issues, which can contribute to high-risk behavior.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with both parents could be protective. However, at such a young age, the environment's influence is significant.\n\nLastly, she believes God has a role in her personal events\u2014this indicates some level of spirituality or religiosity, which can sometimes act as a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history and drug use are concerning. Mental health issues (feeling down) add another layer. However, factors like living with parents, having held a job, and possibly her religious views might mitigate some of the risk. But given that she has an arrest record, recent drug use, and emotional struggles, the overall risk seems moderately high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
