    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 18, which might be a red flag since younger individuals could have more impulsive behavior. But being young doesn't always mean high risk without other factors.\n\nRace: She identifies as Black. While race isn't a direct indicator of risk, there are systemic issues that can affect justice outcomes. However, in this context, I don't see specific details linking her race to increased risk beyond potential biases.\n\nPrevious arrest: She's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be concerning, but no conviction suggests the case might not have led to a guilty verdict. It could indicate a lack of evidence or first-time offense.\n\nLiving situation: Lives alone at 18. Living alone might mean she has more independence but also less support. However, without knowing if there's instability in her living arrangements, it's hard to gauge risk from that alone.\n\nEducation and employment: She has a high school diploma and has held three jobs this year. Stable employment can be a positive indicator, suggesting responsibility and the ability to manage finances, which might lower risk.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't necessarily a high-risk factor unless it's frequent or linked to other issues. However, substance use can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, depending on the context.\n\nMental health: She felt down in the dumps some days in the past month. Depression symptoms could be a risk factor as mental health struggles might impact behavior and decision-making. However, without more severe indicators, it's moderate concern.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 4. Stable family environment is usually protective, but being in an urban area might expose her to more crime or stressors.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers God's role in her life. Religious involvement can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior, suggesting she has support systems and values that deter misconduct.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like arrest history and possible mental health issues, but also several protective factors like employment stability, education, and religious beliefs. Without a conviction and with limited other red flags, the overall risk doesn't seem extremely high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
