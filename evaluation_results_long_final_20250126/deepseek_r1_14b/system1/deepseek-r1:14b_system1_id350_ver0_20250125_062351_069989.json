Let me go through each point.\n\nShe's 22, female, White\u2014age might be relevant as younger individuals could be more impulsive. Her background: arrested twice but no convictions. That arrest history could indicate potential for future issues, even without a conviction.\n\nLiving situation: not living alone, so maybe less risk of isolation-related crimes. Education is high school diploma, working one job\u2014stable employment can reduce risk. No drug use in four years and not depressed recently, which are positive signs.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in a household of six. That could mean some stability but also possibly crowded conditions. She believes God influences her life, suggesting strong belief\u2014could be protective or indicate potential for specific crimes like fraud if that's a motivating factor.\n\nConsidering all factors, the arrest history is significant but not severe. Other aspects are neutral to positive. So, I'd say low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
