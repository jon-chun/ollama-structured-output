    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is pretty young, but not sure if race affects risk here. Next, she has been arrested three times and convicted. That's significant because prior convictions can indicate higher risk for future offenses.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. I'm not sure how weight relates to criminal behavior; maybe in terms of physical presence but probably not a direct indicator.\n\nNever married, not living alone\u2014so she might be living with family or others. That could mean more supervision or support, which might lower risk, but it's hard to say.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can correlate with higher crime rates because fewer opportunities are available. She has held two jobs during the year, which shows some stability but maybe inconsistent work history.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a red flag for potential criminal behavior, especially if it's recent and includes harder drugs like cocaine.\n\nIn the past month, she felt down so much that nothing cheered her up. Depression or mood issues can increase risk of recidivism as stress and mental health struggles might push someone to act out.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Urban areas tend to have higher crime rates, which could mean more exposure to negative influences but not necessarily indicative on its own.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally\u2014this might indicate strong beliefs, possibly providing support but could also tie into potential radicalization or other behaviors influenced by religious factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, lack of education, urban residence\u2014all point towards higher risk. The emotional state and living situation add more weight. However, she has held jobs, which is a positive sign indicating some stability but may not outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
