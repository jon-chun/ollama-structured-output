    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 20 years old. Young age can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments because younger individuals might have less stable lives and more impulsive behavior. But it's not definitive.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity isn't directly indicative of risk, certain groups may have different statistics depending on various factors like crime rates or socioeconomic status. I should consider if there are any relevant stats here, but without specific data, it's hard to say.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. This is a significant red flag. Convictions, especially for violent crimes or multiple offenses, usually increase risk. But the details of the convictions aren't provided, so I can't assess severity. However, even non-violent crimes can contribute to higher risk in some assessments.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here unless there's a specific factor related to physical size and crime type, which isn't mentioned.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being unmarried could mean less stability, but living alone might indicate independence or lack of support systems. Not sure if that's a major risk factor on its own.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher risk, but he has completed high school, which is better than no education.\n\nHeld 3 jobs in the year. Multiple jobs could indicate instability or a transient lifestyle, which might be a slight concern but not necessarily a major one unless there's a pattern of job hopping linked to criminal behavior.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. Marijuana is less severe than other drugs, but any drug use could indicate potential for substance-related crimes or impaired judgment.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is important; lack of depression here might lower some risks associated with mental issues, but he might have other conditions not mentioned.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Large family size might correlate with higher risk if there are issues like poverty or neglect, but without more info, it's unclear.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be both protective (lowering risk) and sometimes linked to certain behaviors, but I don't think this directly impacts risk assessment unless it relates to specific crimes.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior convictions are a big concern, while some other factors like education and not being depressed might slightly mitigate. The overall picture is somewhat concerning due to the arrests and conviction, but without knowing the nature of the offenses, it's hard to gauge severity. I'd say moderate risk with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
