    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old White female. Age-wise, she's relatively young, which might mean less stability but also possibly more opportunities for change. Her being White might not directly impact her risk level unless there are specific demographic factors I'm considering.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, especially if they're recent or unexplained. However, since she wasn't convicted, it could indicate that the charges were dropped or she was acquitted, which might lower her risk somewhat.\n\nHeight and weight aren't typically strong predictors of criminal behavior, so I don't think these factors add much to the analysis.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone now. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if it indicates social isolation, but at 21, this isn't unusual. Her marital status might not be as impactful here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Lack of higher education could be a risk factor, but again, it's not the only determinant. It might indicate limited future opportunities, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Job stability is usually seen as positive, but frequent job changes might suggest issues with commitment or other underlying problems. However, holding multiple jobs could also mean she's trying to establish herself and manage financially, which isn't inherently risky.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance use is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. The fact that she's used both drugs recently might increase her risk. However, she hasn't been convicted of any drug-related offenses yet.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can contribute to higher risk behaviors, so her current lack of depression is somewhat mitigating.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother and a household size of six might indicate a challenging upbringing. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, and larger families could mean less individual attention or more chaotic living conditions, which are risk factors. However, she's lived with her mother, which might provide some stability despite the household size.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can be both a protective factor (offering support and structure) and sometimes lead to rigid behaviors if beliefs conflict with societal norms. But generally, having a belief system can reduce risk by providing coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some red flags like drug use and an arrest, but also factors that might mitigate risk, such as not being convicted, current mental stability, job-holding, and possibly her religious beliefs. The urban upbringing could be a factor, but it's not definitive. Her age and lack of conviction suggest she might still be on the lower end of the risk spectrum.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" for high risk because while there are some concerning factors, they don't all point to a significant threat. However, I'm not entirely certain, so my confidence isn't very high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
