    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is a factor here since younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates, but 18 isn't extremely young. Being white doesn't inherently increase risk unless other factors are present.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A criminal history, even if just a single conviction, can be a red flag. However, it's one arrest, so maybe not the highest indicator on its own.\n\nHeight and weight (6'3\", 175-199 lbs) don't typically correlate with risk unless they're extremes, which they aren't here. Unmarried and living alone might suggest less support systems in place, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college indicates lower educational attainment, which can be linked to higher crime rates. Limited education often correlates with fewer job opportunities and higher stress.\n\nHe held one job during the year, showing some employment history, but it's minimal. Unemployment can contribute to criminal behavior, so having a job might slightly mitigate that risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is present, which could indicate substance abuse issues. Chronic drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates. The recent marijuana use might not be as severe as harder drugs but still adds some risk.\n\nHe reported feeling down in the dumps most of the time during the past month, suggesting possible depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 5 with his biological mother in a rural area might indicate a challenging upbringing. Rural areas could have less access to resources and support systems, potentially contributing to risk factors. However, without more details on family dynamics, it's hard to assess fully.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can be both protective (offering coping mechanisms) or might influence behavior in ways that could either increase or decrease risk depending on the context.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: arrest and conviction, educational challenges, employment status, drug use, mental health indicators, and upbringing environment suggest moderate to high risk. However, he has some mitigating factors like past employment and a stable living situation despite living alone.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
