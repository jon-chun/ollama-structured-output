    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm trying to predict whether a 19-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. The goal is to assign weights (low, medium, high) to each factor and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the provided risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: 19 years old.\n2. **Ethnicity**: Hispanic.\n3. **Previous Arrests/Convictions**: Arrested once, convicted.\n4. **Height/Weight**: 5'11\", 230 lbs.\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone.\n6. **Education**: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n7. **Employment**: Held 3 jobs during the year.\n8. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n9. **Mental Health**: Not felt depressed in the past month.\n10. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 during youth.\n11. **Religious Belief**: Considers God has something to do with what happens.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign weights based on the examples provided.\n\n**1. Age (19 years old)**: In previous examples, younger ages like 18 were often associated with higher recidivism rates. So, this might be a medium risk because it's relatively young but not extremely so.\n\n**2. Ethnicity (Hispanic)**: The examples didn't specifically mention ethnicity as a standalone factor. However, Hispanic individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism. I'll assign low weight here since the data doesn't directly tie ethnicity to recidivism in these cases.\n\n**3. Previous Arrests/Convictions**: Having been arrested and convicted once is significant. In examples, even one conviction was a strong indicator of future arrests. This should be high risk.\n\n**4. Height/Weight (5'11\", 230 lbs.)**: Obesity can be linked to various health issues but not directly to recidivism. Unless it's related to crime involvement, I'll consider this low impact.\n\n**5. Marital Status (Never married, living alone)**: Living alone might indicate fewer support systems, which could contribute to higher risk. Assign medium weight.\n\n**6. Education (High school diploma)**: Having a diploma is better than none but not as strong as being enrolled in college. This might be low since it's neutral compared to other factors.\n\n**7. Employment (3 jobs in the year)**: Stable employment can reduce recidivism. However, holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or necessity rather than career focus. Medium weight here because consistent work is positive but not overwhelming.\n\n**8. Drug Use (Marijuana and cocaine)**: Substance use is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, especially for drugs like cocaine which are more severe. High risk factor.\n\n**9. Mental Health (Not depressed recently)**: No recent mental health issues could be protective. Low weight since it's positive but not directly predictive.\n\n**10. Family Background**: Growing up in a household with a mother and size 5 might indicate some family support, but also possibly challenges if the environment was difficult. Medium weight as mixed factors are present.\n\n**11. Religious Belief**: Believing God has influence might provide behavioral deterrence. Low risk since it's protective but not a strong determinant on its own.\n\nNow, considering all these weights and looking at previous examples where high drug use and prior convictions led to \"YES\" predictions, this case likely falls into that category.\n\nI'm about 70% confident because while substance use and conviction are high risks, factors like employment and no depression might mitigate some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a factor in higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity (Hispanic)\", \"low\", \"No direct tie to recidivism in examples provided\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests/Convictions (Arrested once, convicted)\", \"high\", \"Strong indicator of future arrests\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight (5'11\\\", 230 lbs.)\", \"low\", \"Not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate fewer support systems\"),\n    (\"Education (High school diploma)\", \"low\", \"Neutral compared to other factors\"),\n    (\"Employment (Held 3 jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Mixed impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Strong indicator of future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (Not felt depressed recently)\", \"low\", \"Positive factor but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"Family Background (Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5)\", \"medium\", \"Mixed factors present\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (Considers God has something to do with what happens)\", \"low\", \"Potentially protective but not strong determinant\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"70%\"\n}\n```",
