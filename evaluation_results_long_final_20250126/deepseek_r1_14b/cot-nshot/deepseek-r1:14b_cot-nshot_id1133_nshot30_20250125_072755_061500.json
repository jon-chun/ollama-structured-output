    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. I'll start by looking at each factor individually, assigning a weight of low, medium, or high, and then reason through them.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. In previous examples, younger individuals, especially those around 17-18, have sometimes shown recidivism, but it's not the strongest indicator on its own unless combined with others.\n\nHe has been arrested 17 times and convicted. That's a high number of arrests, which usually is a strong indicator. In earlier cases, even one arrest could sometimes lead to a prediction of YES, so 17 is significant. This definitely seems like a high-weight factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level has been shown to correlate with recidivism. Without formal education, it's harder to find stable jobs, which can push someone back into crime. So this should be medium weight.\n\nHe's living alone. In some examples, living with family seemed protective, so living alone might increase risk. But I don't see a direct correlation in the given data, so maybe low weight here.\n\nHas held 1 job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism. Having at least one job suggests he's trying to stay on track, but it's only one and possibly unstable. So medium weight.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use often correlates with crime and recidivism. This should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHe has felt down all month. Mental health issues can contribute to rearrests. However, without knowing if he's receiving help, it's hard to gauge impact. Medium weight.\n\nLived with his mother in an urban area with 5 siblings. Family dynamics and environment matter. Urban areas might have more crime opportunities, but being raised there doesn't directly cause recidivism unless combined with other factors. So medium weight here.\n\nFeels God has nothing to do with what happens. Low or no religious involvement can affect behavior, but the impact is less clear. Maybe low weight.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: high number of arrests (huge risk), drug use (high), mental health issues (medium), education level and employment (both medium), living situation (low), family environment (medium). \n\nLooking at past examples, even with several moderate factors and one strong high factor like 17 arrests, the prediction leans towards YES. For instance, Example 29 had 17 arrests, drug use, mental health issues, and a non-protective living arrangement, but the outcome was NO. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe I need to check more examples.\n\nWait, in Example 29, despite many strikes against him (arrests, drugs, mental health), the prediction was NO. That might be because of other factors like not being alone or something else. But this case here doesn't have a protective factor like employment\u2014only one job, which isn't strong enough.\n\nIn Examples where high arrest counts and drug use were present with low education, even if other factors are mixed, the prediction was YES, like Example 28 (7 arrests) and Example 30 (3 arrests). So in this case, 17 arrests is a major red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: High-weight factors are arrest history and drug use. Medium weights include mental health, education, employment, and family environment. The combination suggests high risk, so prediction is YES with around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"low\", \"Youthfulness can be a factor but not the strongest indicator on its own\"),\n    (\"Arrested 17 times and convicted\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Education level is linked to employment stability and lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living situation may have a minor impact but is less significant compared to other factors\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Employment can be protective, but limited job history may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years\", \"high\", \"Substance use correlates strongly with criminal behavior and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Felt down all of last month\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles can contribute to recidivism without intervention\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban area, household size 5\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and family dynamics may present challenges but are not definitive predictors\"),\n    (\"Feels God has nothing to do with what happens\", \"low\", \"Spiritual disengagement may have some impact but is less significant compared to other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85\n}\n```",
