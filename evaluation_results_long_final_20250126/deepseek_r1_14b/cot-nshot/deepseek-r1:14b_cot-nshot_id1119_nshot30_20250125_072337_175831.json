    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, which could be a risk factor in some contexts, but from the examples, it doesn't seem like race itself was a direct factor; rather, other variables were more influential.\n\nHe has been arrested 6 times without conviction. Looking at previous examples, high arrest counts (like 7 or 3) often led to \"YES.\" So this might be a medium to high risk.\n\nNo convictions could mean he hasn't been sentenced, which sometimes can lower recidivism because there's no criminal record. But since he was arrested multiple times without conviction, it might indicate issues with the legal system rather than his behavior.\n\nHe is 22 years old. Age is usually a factor where younger individuals have higher recidivism rates, so this could be medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight: He's tall but underweight (140 lbs at 6'2\"). Not sure how relevant this is, but maybe he faces health issues or social challenges because of it. I'd rate this low.\n\nLiving alone might indicate less support, which could be a risk factor. In examples, people living alone sometimes had higher recidivism. So medium here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited education, which is often linked to higher recidivism. This should probably be high.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, so this is definitely high risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years: substance abuse is a major factor for recidivism, so high here.\n\nDepression symptoms (feeling down all month): mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. High risk.\n\nHousehold size of 4 when young: Not sure if this directly affects, but could be low unless there were specific issues, which aren't mentioned, so probably low.\n\nBelieves in God's role in his life: In examples, some had high faith and didn't reoffend, while others did. It might not be a direct factor, so maybe low.\n\nNow, compiling these weights:\n\n- Multiple arrests (6 times): High\n- Unemployed: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Depression: High\n- No diploma/GED: High\n- Living alone: Medium\n- Age 22: Medium\n- Race: Low (not a direct factor)\n- Height/weight: Low\n- Household size: Low\n- Religion: Low\n\nThe majority of factors are high or medium, especially the critical ones like arrests, unemployment, drugs, and mental health. So it's likely he'll recidivate.\n\nConfidence is around 75% because while there are several strong risk factors, some might not strongly predict without more context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested 6 times without conviction\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests often correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Education level is linked to employment and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Unemployed for the year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Depression symptoms\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Age 22\", \"medium\", \"Younger age can be a factor in higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"Believes God's role in life\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can sometimes reduce recidivism but not always\"),\n    (\"Race (Black)\", \"low\", \"Not a direct factor based on examples\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Irrelevant to recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"No specific impact mentioned in examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
