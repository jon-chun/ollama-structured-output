    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the provided information about him:\n\n- **Age**: 22 years old.\n- **Race**: White.\n- **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested twice, convicted once.\n- **Height and Weight**: 5'5\", 155 lbs. That seems average for his height, so probably not an issue here.\n- **Marital Status**: Never married, currently living alone.\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college.\n- **Employment**: Held two jobs during the year.\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n- **Mental Health**: Some days he's felt down, nothing could cheer him up (suggesting possible depression).\n- **Family Background**: Lived with his biological father in a household of size 4 when young.\n- **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Considers that God has something to do with what happens to him.\n\nNow, I'll compare these factors against the examples provided to assign weights. \n\n1. **Arrest and Conviction History**: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, prior arrests are a significant factor. For instance, in Example 28, 7 arrests led to YES. But he only has two arrests with one conviction, so maybe this is a medium risk because it's not extremely high but still concerning.\n\n2. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. In previous cases, lack of education was often linked to higher recidivism. For example, Example 17 didn't have a diploma and had other factors leading to NO. So perhaps this is a medium factor because it's a barrier but maybe not the strongest on its own.\n\n3. **Employment**: He has held two jobs. Employment can be protective against recidivism, so this might actually be a low risk factor as he's maintaining some stability through work.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: Used both marijuana and cocaine recently. In many examples, drug use was present but often combined with other high-risk factors. Since drugs are linked to criminal behavior, this is likely a medium or high factor. Given that it's recent and multiple substances, maybe medium.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: He's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if not addressed, but without more severe symptoms, perhaps low impact here unless compounded by other factors.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Lived with his father in a household of four. In examples, family dynamics varied; sometimes being raised by a parent was neutral or had mixed effects. Maybe this is a low factor since it's not indicating abuse or neglect explicitly.\n\n7. **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Believes God influences events. Some studies suggest spirituality can reduce recidivism, so maybe a low risk here as it might provide support.\n\nPutting these together:\n\n- Arrest/Conviction: Medium\n- Education: Medium (since lack of diploma is a barrier)\n- Employment: Low (positive factor)\n- Drug Use: Medium\n- Mental Health: Low\n- Family Background: Low\n- Spirituality: Low\n\nLooking at the examples, when multiple medium factors are present, especially with drug use and prior arrests, the outcome often leans towards YES. However, his employment might mitigate some risk. But considering he has two prior arrests, recent drug use, and possible mental health issues, I think it's more likely than not that he'll recidivate.\n\nI'm estimating confidence around 70% because while there are several moderate risks, the positive aspects (employment) might lower it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests with one conviction suggest past involvement but not extreme history compared to examples where high arrest counts led to YES\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of diploma and no college enrollment can be a barrier, seen in some examples as contributing to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates stability which may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is linked to higher recidivism in previous cases\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down but no indication of severe issues, so less impactful on its own\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with father doesn't indicate negative influence as seen in some examples where family dynamics varied\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide support, potentially reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
