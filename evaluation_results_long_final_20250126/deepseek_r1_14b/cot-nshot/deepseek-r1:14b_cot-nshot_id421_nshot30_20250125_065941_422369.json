    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male. Age is often a significant factor because younger individuals are generally more likely to reoffend. However, since he's in his early twenties, this might be considered a medium risk, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Looking at the examples provided, multiple arrests seem to have a high weight. For instance, in Example 29, someone with 17 arrests had a NO outcome, but that's an extreme case. More moderately, having three arrests likely contributes significantly to recidivism risk.\n\nHe weighs 170 lbs and is 6 feet tall. From the examples, physical build didn't seem to play a direct role unless it's related to crime type, which isn't specified here. So I might consider this a low factor unless there's more context.\n\nHe's living alone, hasn't been married. In previous cases, living arrangement didn't always correlate with recidivism. Some individuals lived alone and had outcomes both ways. This could be medium if considered as a potential lack of support, but it's not the strongest indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma, which is better than no diploma, but in some examples, education level was a low factor since many without diplomas still didn't reoffend. So this might be low.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year, which is positive as employment can reduce recidivism. In the examples, those with jobs often had lower risk, so this should be a high or medium factor. I'll lean towards medium because while it's positive, it's not the strongest protective factor here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of low risk, as drugs often contribute to recidivism. This should be a high weight in reducing risk.\n\nHe felt down during some times in the past month. Emotional distress can sometimes lead to criminal behavior if he lacks coping mechanisms. However, compared to other factors like drug use or multiple arrests, this might have a lower weight but still notable.\n\nComing from an urban area with four siblings doesn't seem to consistently predict recidivism in examples. Some had high family sizes and rearrested, others didn't. So I'll consider this low unless there's more context about family dynamics.\n\nLastly, he doesn't think God influences his life, which might indicate lower internal controls or support. In some cases, spirituality was a protective factor, so the absence could be a medium risk.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors:\n\n- 3 prior arrests: high\n- Positive employment history: medium (but not high)\n- No drug use: high\n- Emotional issues: low-medium\n- Others like living alone, education, family size: low\n\nBalancing these, the positive aspects (employment, no drugs) counter some negatives. But three arrests and possible emotional vulnerabilities might still push towards higher risk.\n\nLooking at examples where similar factors were present:\n\nExample 6 had multiple arrests, no drug use, felt down, urban living. Outcome was NO.\nExample 28: 7 arrests, drugs, high recidivism (YES).\nOur case has 3 arrests, no drugs, some emotional issues. So it's less severe than Example 28 but more than some others.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium confidence that he might not rearrest (NO), but there's a significant chance due to the arrest history and emotional factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"3 prior arrests are a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs is positive but not the strongest factor\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"No drug use significantly reduces risk\"),\n    (\"Emotional state\", \"low\", \"Feeling down is a minor factor compared to others\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone has mixed implications\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is neutral\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Urban and family size don't strongly correlate here\"),\n    (\"Spirituality beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief might indicate lower controls\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
