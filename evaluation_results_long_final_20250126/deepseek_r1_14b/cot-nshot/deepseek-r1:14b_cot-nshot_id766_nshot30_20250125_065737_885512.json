    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm trying to predict whether a 22-year-old White female will recidivate (rearrest) within three years based on her risk factors. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given information:\n\n- **Age**: 22 years old.\n- **Gender**: Female.\n- **Race**: White.\n- **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested once, convicted.\n- **Current Status**: Married, living with spouse.\n- **Education**: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n- **Employment**: Held two jobs during the year.\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years.\n- **Mental Health**: Not depressed in the past month.\n- **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area as a child.\n- **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Considers God has something to do with what happens to her.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign a weight (low, medium, high) based on the examples provided.\n\n1. **Arrest and Conviction History**: She's been arrested once and convicted. In previous examples, those with multiple arrests and convictions had higher recidivism rates. However, one arrest might be considered low to moderate. But since she was convicted, it could have a medium impact.\n\n2. **Age at Release**: 22 is relatively young, which is typically a lower risk factor for recidivism. So, this would likely be low.\n\n3. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being married and living with her spouse is generally seen as a protective factor against recidivism. This should be low.\n\n4. **Education Level**: Having a high school diploma might not be as strong as being enrolled in college, but it's better than no education. In previous examples, lack of education was a higher risk, so this would be medium.\n\n5. **Employment Status**: Holding two jobs indicates stability and lower likelihood of recidivism. This should be low to medium.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is often linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if it's recent. In examples, drug use was a significant factor, so this would be high.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: No depression reported recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not currently depressed, this is low.\n\n8. **Family Background**: Growing up in a rural area with a household of five. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more specifics on dysfunction, it might be medium.\n\n9. **Spirituality/Beliefs**: Believing God has a role in her life was sometimes associated with lower recidivism in examples, so this is low.\n\nNext, I'll weight each factor:\n\n- High: Drug Use (40%)\n- Medium: Education Level and Family Background (25% each)\n- Low: Arrest History, Age, Marital Status, Employment, Spirituality (10% each)\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nHigh (40%) + Medium (25% + 25%) + Low (10% * 4) = 90%\n\nWait, that might be too high. Maybe I should adjust the weights more carefully.\n\nLooking at previous examples where factors like multiple arrests and drug use led to 'YES', but one arrest with protective factors like marriage and employment might lean towards 'NO'. However, the recent marijuana use is a significant factor.\n\nConsidering all, the prediction is likely 'NO' with moderate confidence, around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, which may indicate a higher risk of recidivism compared to someone with no criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Age at Release\", \"low\", \"Her age is relatively young, which generally correlates with a lower risk of recidivism compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"She is married and living with her spouse, which can be seen as a protective factor against recidivism due to social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma may provide some protection against recidivism but could have been stronger if she was enrolled in college or had higher education.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the year indicates employment stability, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use over the past four years can be a significant factor contributing to recidivism, especially if it's a ongoing issue or related to her criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces the risk of recidivism associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of five in a rural area may have some influence, but without specific indicators of dysfunction, it's considered moderate\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has a role in her life can be a protective factor against recidivism, though its impact may vary.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": \"70%\"\n}\n```",
