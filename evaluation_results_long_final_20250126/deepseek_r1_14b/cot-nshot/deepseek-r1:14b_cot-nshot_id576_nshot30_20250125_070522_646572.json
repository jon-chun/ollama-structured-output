    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this case and then predict whether this person will rearrest in three years. Let's start by going through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old White female. That might not be a strong factor on its own, but age could play a role since younger people are often more impulsive and at higher risk for recidivism.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Looking back at the examples, prior arrests seem significant. For instance, Example 29 had multiple arrests (17) and was predicted as NO, while Examples with fewer arrests like 3 or less sometimes lead to YES or NO depending on other factors. So a single arrest might be low risk here.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 185 lbs. I don't think physical attributes directly correlate with recidivism, so maybe this isn't a strong factor either.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability. In the examples, some individuals were not living alone or had unstable living situations, which might increase risk. So being married could be protective, making this a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates. In previous cases where education was lacking, especially without any enrollment, it seemed to have a medium impact because it's a known indicator but not the strongest on its own.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs during the year. Employment can be a strong protective factor against recidivism. Consistent employment usually reduces the risk of reoffending. So holding multiple jobs might indicate she's trying to stay employed, which is positive, so maybe low impact here, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant factor because it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior to support the habit. In examples, drug use often led to higher recidivism rates when combined with other factors. So this might be a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not currently feeling depressed, this might be low impact. However, if she has a history of mental health issues, it could still matter, but we don't have that info here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This could indicate instability in her early environment. Growing up in such conditions might contribute to higher risk factors for delinquency and recidivism. Looking back at examples where living situations were unstable, the impact was sometimes medium.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against recidivism because it often provides support networks and encourages positive behavior. So this might be a low risk factor as it's seen as protective.\n\nNow, weighing all these:\n\n- Prior conviction: Medium (since one arrest is better than multiple)\n- Drug use: High\n- Lack of education: Medium\n- Marital status and living situation: Low\n- Employment: Low\n- Early living environment: Medium\n- Religious beliefs: Low\n\nThe high factors are drug use. The mediums are prior conviction, lack of education, early environment. The lows are others.\n\nLooking at the examples, when drug use is present (even with other issues), it often leads to YES. For example, Examples 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,12 had drug use and sometimes rearrested.\n\nIn this case, she has a prior conviction, drug use, lack of education, and unstable early living. These are moderate to high factors but also some positives like being married and employed.\n\nConsidering the balance, I think it's on the higher side for recidivism, so prediction is YES with maybe 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates past criminal behavior, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can lead to further criminal activity for obtaining drugs, significantly increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and enrollment are linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"early_living_environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an unstable living situation can contribute to delinquency and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married may indicate some stability, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
