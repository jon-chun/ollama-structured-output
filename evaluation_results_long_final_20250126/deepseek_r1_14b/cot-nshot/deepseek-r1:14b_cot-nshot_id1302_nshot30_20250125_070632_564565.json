    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given examples and my analysis of risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old Black male. In the examples provided, race didn't seem to directly impact the outcome, but age might be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, prior arrests and convictions are significant. For instance, in Example 29, someone with 17 arrests and 3 convictions had an outcome of NO. But that person was female, which might matter. However, most males with multiple arrests (like Examples 28 and 30) with high arrest counts were YES.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism; lower education can be a risk factor. In the examples, many individuals without education had higher risks, so this might be a medium factor.\n\nHe's living alone, which could be a negative indicator since lack of social support might lead to more criminal behavior. In previous cases, those not living alone sometimes had better outcomes, but it's not always consistent.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which is a strong risk factor for recidivism. Many examples with recent drug use resulted in YES outcomes, so this should be high weight.\n\nHe has felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or stress, which can contribute to criminal behavior. Mental health issues are another risk factor, though it's perhaps less impactful than others.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 4 with his biological mother might indicate some family dynamics, but without more info, this is low impact unless other factors are strong.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which could be positive (motivation) or negative (stress from religious pressure). In examples, this factor didn't always predict outcomes clearly, so it's a low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrests/convictions, drug use, unemployment (since he held 2 jobs during the year but maybe inconsistent), and mental health issues are strong factors. His lack of education is medium, living alone is low to medium, family background low, age medium, race might not be a direct factor here.\n\nComparing to examples: someone with two arrests and convictions, drug use, and mental health issues would likely have higher recidivism. Looking at Examples 28 (7 arrests, YES), 30 (3 arrests, YES), and others, the presence of multiple risk factors increases the likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can be a moderate risk factor as education is linked to lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could contribute to higher risk but is less impactful than other factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_recent\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) strongly correlates with increased likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_struggles\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps indicates potential mental health issues, which can be a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background_size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 may not directly impact recidivism but could have some influence depending on dynamics\"),\n    (\"spirituality_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide personal motivation or stress, with unclear impact on recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
