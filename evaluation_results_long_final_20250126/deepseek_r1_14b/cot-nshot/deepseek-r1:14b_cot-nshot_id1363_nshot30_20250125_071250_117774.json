    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. First, I'll list out all the provided information about him.\n\nHe's a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested six times and convicted. He currently lives alone and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. He has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. His weight is 180 lbs, which is average for his height. He uses marijuana and cocaine recently. He experienced some depression in the past month, feeling down with no cheer. He lived in an urban area with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size four during his youth. He believes God has a role in what happens to him.\n\nLooking at previous examples (1-30), I notice that prior arrests and convictions are significant predictors. In example 28, seven arrests led to a \"YES\" prediction, while six arrests here might be high risk but not as extreme. His lack of employment is another red flag since having a job can reduce recidivism chances. Not being enrolled in college despite having a GED suggests possible disengagement.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator. In many examples, drug use correlated with rearrests. His recent depression adds emotional stress, which could impair decision-making. The living situation with non-parental adults might indicate weaker support or supervision, possibly contributing to delinquency.\n\nComparing to examples: someone with six arrests (example 30 had three and was \"YES\"), no job (example 27 had none and was \"NO\" after one arrest), drugs used in many \"YES\" cases. His factors collectively seem strong for recidivism, so I'd predict \"YES\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests\", \"high\", \"6 prior arrests significantly increase risk\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs in the past year is a concern\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana and cocaine use indicates ongoing issues\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may limit support but not a major factor here\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can impact behavior and decision-making\"),\n    (\"Residential history\", \"low\", \"Living with non-parental adults in urban area\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
