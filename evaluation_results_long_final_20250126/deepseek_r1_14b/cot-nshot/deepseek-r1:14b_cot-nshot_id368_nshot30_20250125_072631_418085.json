    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided examples and a weighted risk factor analysis. Let's break down each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old White male. He has been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, arrest without conviction sometimes led to \"NO\" outcomes, like Examples 1,7,9, and 27, where there was no rearrest despite some other risk factors.\n\nHe weighs 205 lbs, which is on the higher side, but in previous cases, weight alone didn't seem to be a significant factor. His height (6'1\") doesn't appear to impact recidivism based on examples.\n\nHe's never been married and currently lives alone. In some examples, living alone was present but didn't necessarily correlate with rearrest outcomes; it might not be a major factor here.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this should be a positive factor, probably \"low\" risk in terms of contributing to rearrest.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. In Examples like 15 and 26, having a job was protective against rearrest. So consistent employment might mitigate some risks here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is often linked with higher recidivism, especially when it's marijuana, which can be a significant factor. However, the lack of depression might slightly reduce that risk compared to cases where mental health issues are present.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a rural household of size 5. Family structure and community context can influence recidivism rates. Living in a stable family environment might have protective effects, but being in a rural area could limit access to support systems. The examples show mixed outcomes based on this factor.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him, which is more of a personal belief. In some cases, strong religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism, so this might slightly reduce risk.\n\nLooking at similar examples where factors like arrest without conviction, education, employment, and stable family background led to \"NO\" outcomes despite minor issues like drug use, I think the positive factors here outweigh the negatives.\n\nSo assigning weights:\n- Arrest history: medium (1 arrest but no conviction)\n- Education level: low (positive factor)\n- Employment: low (positive)\n- Drug use: medium\n- Family stability: low (positive)\n- Religious belief: low (positive)\n\nConsidering these, I'd predict \"NO\" rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (1 arrest but no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"In the examples, individuals with arrests without convictions sometimes did not reoffend, though it's a notable factor\"),\n    (\"Education level (high school diploma and enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Employment status (held 1 job during the year)\", \"low\", \"Consistent employment can be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana in past four years)\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is linked to higher recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"Living situation (currently living alone)\", \"low\", \"No strong correlation with recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Family background (lived with both biological parents in a rural area)\", \"low\", \"Stable family background may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's role\", \"low\", \"Strong beliefs can sometimes deter criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
