    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this recidivism prediction step by step. I need to evaluate each risk factor for the given case and assign a weight of low, medium, or high based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the person's age: she's 18. In the examples, younger individuals (like 17 or 18) didn't always have a strong influence unless other factors were severe. So I'll consider this as low because age alone isn't a significant predictor without other issues.\n\nNext, race is Black. From the examples, race wasn't a standalone factor; it was more about other variables like drug use and convictions. So race here might be low impact on its own.\n\nShe's been arrested 7 times and convicted. In previous cases, high arrest/conviction numbers were significant. For example, in case #29, she had 17 arrests but a NO outcome, possibly due to other mitigating factors. However, her 7 arrests are substantial, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nWeight status is 5'5\" and 120 lbs. In the examples, weight didn't seem to affect outcomes unless it was extremely high or low. So this will be low.\n\nLiving situation: she's living alone. In some cases, living with others seemed protective, but in others, living alone didn't change much. I'll rate this as low since it's neutral without additional context.\n\nEducation-wise, no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. This was a factor in several examples (like #27) where lack of education correlated with higher risk. So medium here.\n\nEmployment status: held no jobs during the year. In cases like #16, unemployment was a high factor leading to recidivism. So this is definitely high.\n\nDrug use: she used cocaine in the past four years. In many examples, recent drug use was a strong indicator for recidivism, often rated high. So medium here because it's more severe than other drugs maybe?\n\nMental health: all the time felt down in the dumps. This is significant as mental health issues can impair coping and lead to further offenses. High impact.\n\nFamily background: lived with both parents in a rural household of size 5. In examples, family status didn't always influence outcomes unless other factors were at play. So low here.\n\nLastly, spirituality: she feels God has nothing to do with her situation. This was present in some cases but didn't seem to directly correlate. Maybe medium since it's more about attitude than behavior.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the high-weight factors are arrests/convictions, employment status, and mental health. The presence of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism. However, in some examples, even with several issues, outcomes varied. Given her 7 arrests, lack of job, and severe depression, I might lean towards YES but not extremely confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is relatively low but does not strongly indicate recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race was not a significant factor in previous examples when considered alone\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and convictions are significant indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight_status\", \"low\", \"Weight did not emerge as a significant factor in the provided examples\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone was not strongly correlated with recidivism in previous cases\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education may contribute to higher risk but is less impactful than other factors\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No employment for a year significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Cocaine use in recent years is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"high\", \"Severe depression ('down in the dumps all the time') is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Family status was not a significant predictor in previous examples\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has no role may slightly increase risk but is less impactful\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
