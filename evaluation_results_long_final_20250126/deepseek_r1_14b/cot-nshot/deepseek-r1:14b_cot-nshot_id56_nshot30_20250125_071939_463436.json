    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old female will recidivate within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one, assign a weight (low, medium, high), and then see how they all add up.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. In the examples provided, younger individuals like 18-year-olds had both YES and NO outcomes. Age alone doesn't seem to be a strong determinant here unless combined with other factors.\n\nNext, she's White. Looking at the examples, race didn't consistently predict recidivism, so I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nShe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. In previous cases, multiple arrests and convictions were significant factors leading to YES outcomes, especially when combined with others. So, this is a high-weight factor.\n\nHer weight is between 175-199 lbs., which is on the higher side for someone her height, but I don't see a direct link in the examples connecting weight to recidivism. This might be low or medium; perhaps medium since it could indicate health issues that might affect behavior.\n\nShe hasn't completed high school or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In many cases, lack of education correlates with higher recidivism rates. So this is a medium factor.\n\nShe's not living alone currently, which might mean she's in a situation where supervision or negative influences are present. This could be low to medium; I'll go with medium because living arrangements can impact behavior.\n\nShe has held 2 jobs during the year. Employment is generally seen as protective against recidivism, but having only two jobs might not be sufficient. So this would be a low factor, but maybe leaning towards medium since it's better than no employment.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use was a strong indicator across examples, leading to higher recidivism rates. This is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nShe has felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or low self-esteem. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so this is a medium factor.\n\nLastly, she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her, which might indicate some level of spirituality. In examples, this didn't consistently predict outcomes but could be seen as a protective factor if it leads to positive behavior. So I'll assign low weight here.\n\nNow, tallying up the weights: high factors (arrests/drug use) are strong indicators towards recidivism. The medium factors include education level, living situation, mental health, and possibly others that add up. There aren't many strong protective factors here except maybe employment and spirituality, which are weaker.\n\nConsidering all these, it seems more likely she might recidivate within three years, but there's some uncertainty due to mixed factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and convictions strongly correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana and cocaine use is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of diploma or GED enrollment can indicate lower social support\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may suggest environmental challenges\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"Having 2 jobs shows some stability but not enough\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"No direct link to recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Not a significant factor in previous cases\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"May offer some protection but not strong enough\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22 is young but not a strong indicator alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
