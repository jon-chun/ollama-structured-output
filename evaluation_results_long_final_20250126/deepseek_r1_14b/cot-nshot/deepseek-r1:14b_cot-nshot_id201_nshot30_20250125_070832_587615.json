    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict whether this 20-year-old Hispanic female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. In the examples, younger individuals like 18 or so sometimes had outcomes both ways. But generally, younger people might have more chances for recidivism. I'll rate this as medium because it's a bit of an ambiguous point.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, several people had multiple arrests and convictions, but in her case, only one arrest without conviction. In Example 7, someone with 17 arrests and convictions resulted in NO, so maybe having no conviction is protective. I'll give this a low weight.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 160 lbs. Body type didn't seem to matter much in the examples; it's more about other factors like employment or drug use. So I think this is irrelevant here\u2014low impact.\n\nNever married, not living alone now. In some cases, living alone might mean less support, but she isn't currently doing that. Not sure if marital status affects recidivism directly, so maybe low weight here.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities. People without education are more likely to commit crimes due to lack of alternatives. This should be high impact.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides income and structure. But she hasn't completed anything yet, so maybe medium weight since it's a positive factor but not certain.\n\nNo drug use in four years. Past drug use was often linked to higher recidivism, especially if ongoing. Her abstinence is good, so low impact here.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times this month. Emotional distress can lead to impulsive behavior or relapse into crime as a coping mechanism. This should be medium because mental health issues are significant but not the strongest factor on their own.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 during childhood. Family environment can influence delinquency, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact. Maybe low weight unless other factors make it worse.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. In examples, some with strong religious beliefs had lower recidivism rates. This could be protective, so medium weight because it might help deter crime.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: education level is high negative, emotional distress and unemployment are moderate negatives, arrest history is low but present, while employment and God belief are positives. Overall, the lack of education and current emotional state are strong negatives, which might outweigh other positives. But she hasn't been convicted yet, so that's a plus.\n\nLooking at similar examples, someone without a diploma, unemployed, with emotional issues might have higher recidivism. However, her employment history is mixed\u2014she held 3 jobs but maybe not consistently. \n\nI think the confidence level should be around 60% because there are significant risk factors but also some protective ones. So I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age can sometimes indicate higher risk for recidivism, though not conclusive\"),\n    (\"arrest_not_convicted\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction may have less impact than multiple arrests or convictions\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between body type and recidivism in the examples provided\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status does not strongly indicate higher risk based on the given examples\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED is a known significant risk factor for recidivism as it limits employment opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs may provide some stability, but lack of formal education could affect long-term prospects\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces potential risk factors associated with substance abuse\"),\n    (\"mental_health_emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can be a contributing factor to impulsive behavior or relapse into criminal activity\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Household size alone does not strongly predict recidivism without additional context on family dynamics\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may provide some protective factors against recidivism, though its impact varies\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
