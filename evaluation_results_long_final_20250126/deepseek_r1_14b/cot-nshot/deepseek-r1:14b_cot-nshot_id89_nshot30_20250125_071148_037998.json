    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this 21-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight of low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. In the examples provided, previous convictions seemed to be a strong indicator. For instance, in Example 1, a prior conviction led to a \"YES.\" But here, no conviction yet, so maybe this is a lower risk factor compared to someone with convictions.\n\nNext, his height and weight: 5'11\" and 182 lbs. I don't think these stats directly correlate with rearrest risk in the examples provided, so probably low impact.\n\nHe's never been married. Looking at past cases, marital status didn't seem to be a significant factor in determining recidivism, so this is likely low.\n\nCurrently living alone: In some examples, living alone was mentioned but didn't consistently influence the outcome. Maybe medium? Or perhaps low since it's not a dominant factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. But he only has a diploma, which is mixed. I'll consider this as medium because it's somewhat protective but not strong.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment status is usually a positive indicator against recidivism. Consistent work reduces the likelihood of rearrest, so this should be high. However, since he only held one job, maybe it's medium?\n\nNo drug use in the past four years: Drug use was a significant factor in many examples where outcomes were \"YES.\" So avoiding drugs is protective; this should be high.\n\nNot felt depressed recently: Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. Since he isn't currently depressed, that's positive, so high impact.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 6 as a child. Family structure and environment can influence outcomes. Growing up in an urban area might expose him to more negative influences, but having both parents could be protective. The examples showed mixed results here. I'll lean towards medium because it's a balance between positive and negative factors.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life: Spiritual beliefs can deter criminal behavior. In past cases, this was sometimes mentioned as a positive factor. So high impact, but maybe medium since it's not the strongest predictor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- High school diploma: Medium\n- Employment (one job): Medium\n- No drug use: High\n- No depression: High\n- Spiritual belief: High\n- Arrests without convictions: Low\n- Living alone: Low\n- Urban upbringing: Medium\n\nLooking at the examples, factors like prior convictions and drug use were strong. Since he has no convictions and no recent drug use, these high-weight positives might outweigh other negatives.\n\nIn similar cases where individuals had no convictions, education, employment, and no drug use led to \"NO\" predictions. His stable work history and clean drug record are significant positives, while factors like living alone and urban background have less impact here.\n\nSo, weighing all, I think the prediction is \"NO.\" Confidence is around 75% because there are still some risk factors, but the protective ones are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"No convictions despite two arrests, which may indicate lower intent to reoffend\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism in examples provided\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married but not a strong indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Some examples showed living alone as a risk factor, but others didn't; considered moderate\"),\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"medium\", \"Education can be protective but not the strongest factor here\"),\n    (\"Employment status (held 1 job)\", \"medium\", \"Steady employment is positive but only one job was held\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"high\", \"Strong protective factor as seen in examples where drug use led to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Not felt depressed over the past month\", \"high\", \"Positive mental health contributes to lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Mixed impact; urban environment could be negative, but family presence might be positive\"),\n    (\"Believes God has a role in his life\", \"high\", \"Spiritual beliefs can deter criminal behavior, as seen in some examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
