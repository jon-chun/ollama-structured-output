    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this 18-year-old female is likely to rearrest in the next three years. I'll go through each of her risk factors one by one, assign a weight (low, medium, high) based on examples provided, and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, she was arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, many people with arrests but no convictions didn't rearrest, like Examples 7, 8, 9, etc. So maybe this isn't a huge risk factor here. I'll mark it as low.\n\nShe's white. In the provided data, race doesn't seem to directly correlate with recidivism outcomes; other factors like drug use and convictions were more impactful. So I'll assign a low weight here too.\n\nHer height is 5'1\" and she weighs between 125-149 lbs. Body size didn't come up in the examples as a significant factor, so this is low.\n\nShe's never married. In some cases, marital status was mentioned but wasn't a strong indicator on its own. So I'll keep it low.\n\nCurrently not living alone might be a factor. Looking at Example 29, someone not living alone rearrested, but others didn't. It's mixed, so maybe medium?\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level was a factor in some examples, like Example 17 where lack of education might have contributed to recidivism. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can be protective, but having only one job might not be enough. Maybe medium here because inconsistent employment could indicate instability.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples where rearrest occurred, like Examples 1, 3, 4, etc. So this is high.\n\nNo history of depression in the past month. Mental health wasn't always mentioned, but it's more positive here, so low.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 5. Family background and environment can influence recidivism. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium factor.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her life. Spirituality was mentioned in some examples but didn't directly predict outcomes, so low here.\n\nNow, summing up the weights: one high (drug use), a couple of mediums (education and employment, living situation), and the rest lows. Looking at previous cases where drug use was high but other factors were mixed, sometimes rearrest happened, sometimes not. Her lack of conviction is a positive sign, education issues are medium negatives, and she's employed but only once. So I'm leaning towards maybe 60% confidence, but on the lower side because she hasn't been convicted yet and has some protective factors like employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"Previous arrests without convictions are common and may not strongly predict future recidivism\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism in this dataset\"),\n    (\"Height/weight\", \"low\", \"Body measurements do not correlate with recidivism outcomes\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status does not strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"Currently not living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living situation can influence social support and stability\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED\", \"medium\", \"Education level is moderately correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment status (held 1 job)\", \"medium\", \"Limited employment history may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"Recent drug use (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"No depression symptoms\", \"low\", \"Absence of mental health issues can be protective\"),\n    (\"Family background and urban residence\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and family dynamics may contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/religious views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is less impactful in this context\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
