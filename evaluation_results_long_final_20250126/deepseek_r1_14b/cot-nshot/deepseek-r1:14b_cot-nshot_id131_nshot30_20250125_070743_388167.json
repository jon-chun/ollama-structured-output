    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this individual based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. His age might be significant because younger individuals are often at higher risk for recidivism. However, I don't have enough examples specific to 20-year-olds, so I'll note this as a low-weighted factor unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Looking back at the examples, multiple arrests and convictions (especially three or more) usually lead to a \"YES\" prediction. For instance, Examples 28 and 30 have high arrest counts and are predicted as \"YES.\" So, this is a strong indicator with a high weight.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which in some cases might be seen as less support and potentially higher risk. However, in the examples, being alone wasn't always a determining factor unless combined with other issues. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational challenges often correlate with higher recidivism rates. Examples like 7, 14, 27, and 29 show that lack of education is linked to \"NO\" outcomes, but it's still an important factor. This gets a medium weight.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor because financial instability might push someone towards criminal behavior. In Examples 14 and 27, unemployment led to \"NO,\" but in others, it was part of a pattern leading to \"YES.\" This is another medium-weighted factor.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism. In Examples like 28 and 30, drug use contributed to \"YES\" outcomes. This is high weight because substance abuse often leads to continued criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can influence behavior, but since he's not reporting depression now, this might have a low impact unless other factors are severe. I'll assign a low weight here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area within a household of four. Family environment and community context matter. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to weigh this heavily. This gets a medium weight because living in an urban setting might present more challenges.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs might influence behavior but don't directly predict recidivism. I'll give this a low weight unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nNow, weighing these: arrests and convictions are high (3), drug use is high (2). Lack of education and unemployment are both medium (each - 2 points). Living alone, urban background, and family status are medium (-1 each). No depression and spiritual beliefs are low (-0.5 each). \n\nAdding up: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + (-1) + (-1) + (-0.5) + (-0.5) = around 6 points. Considering other examples, this combination might lead to a \"YES\" but with moderate confidence because some factors are not as strong as in the examples where \"YES\" was more definitive.\n\nI'll predict \"YES\" with about 70% confidence because while there are significant risk factors like multiple arrests and drug use, other aspects like living alone and lack of education add to the risk, though they aren't the strongest predictors on their own.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old may be a higher risk group for recidivism but not definitive\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is correlated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held in the past year can contribute to financial instability and potential criminal activity\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression may reduce some risk factors related to mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background_community_context\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother in a household of 4 could present challenges but not definitive\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role may have mitigating effects but is less predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7\n}\n```",
