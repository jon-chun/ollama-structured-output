    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at her arrest history: she was arrested once but not convicted. In previous examples, like Example 1 where someone had one arrest and no conviction, the outcome was NO. So this might be a low weight since it's just one instance without a conviction.\n\nNext, her education level is a GED. Comparing to examples, having a high school diploma or GED didn't seem to have a strong effect unless combined with other factors. Maybe medium here because it shows she has some educational attainment but not necessarily strong academic support.\n\nShe's currently not living alone and was previously divorced. In past cases, being single or not living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, especially if there were other issues like substance use or mental health. So this might be a medium weight as it indicates possible instability.\n\nShe held only one job in the year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor for recidivism because of financial stress. In examples where people had inconsistent jobs, rearrest was sometimes more likely. This could be a medium to high weight.\n\nHer mental health is concerning\u2014she's been feeling down most of the time this month. Depression and other mood disorders can affect behavior and decision-making, increasing the risk. Looking at examples like Example 27, where someone had mental health issues and used drugs, led to NO, but that also involved drug use. Here, without drug use, it might still be a high weight because mental health is significant.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years but feels down. In past cases, substance abuse was a major factor, so the absence here lowers this particular risk. However, her mental health and other factors still play a role.\n\nHer household size at a young age was 3, which isn't as concerning as larger or smaller sizes in previous examples. So probably low weight here.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe God influences her circumstances. In some examples, spirituality seemed to have an impact on behavior, but without it being a dominant factor, this might be a low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest (low), GED (medium), not living alone/divorced (medium), one job (medium), mental health issues (high), no drug use (low), household size (low), spirituality (low). The mental health stands out as the highest risk factor. Considering examples where mental health was a key factor led to NO, but in this case, there's also the arrest history and other moderate factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of NO with maybe 65% confidence because while mental health is significant, there are several mitigating factors like no drug use and one prior arrest without conviction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History: 1 arrest, not convicted\", \"low\", \"Previous examples show that a single arrest without conviction is less predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education Level: GED certificate\", \"medium\", \"Some educational attainment but may indicate limited academic support\"),\n    (\"Living Situation: Currently not living alone; previously divorced\", \"medium\", \"Indicates potential instability in living arrangements\"),\n    (\"Employment Status: Held 1 job in the year\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental Health: Most of the time, felt down in dumps\", \"high\", \"Persistent depression can impair decision-making and increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Drug Use: No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of substance abuse is protective\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age: 3\", \"low\", \"Not strongly correlated with recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Spirituality: Considers God has nothing to do with her circumstances\", \"low\", \"Lack of spiritual support may have limited impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
