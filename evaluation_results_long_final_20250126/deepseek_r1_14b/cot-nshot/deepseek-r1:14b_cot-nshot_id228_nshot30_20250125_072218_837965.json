    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this case where an 18-year-old White male has a history of arrests and convictions. Let me start by breaking down each aspect mentioned.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted, which seems significant. In the examples provided, higher arrest counts like 7 or 3 times led to \"YES\" outcomes, so this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and isn't enrolled in college. Looking at the examples, lack of education was often associated with recidivism, especially when combined with other factors. This should be a medium weight since it's important but maybe not as strong as arrests.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean less support systems. In some cases, living alone was mentioned as a risk factor, so I'll assign low to this one because while it's a concern, it's probably not the main issue here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is often linked with recidivism, especially when combined with other factors. However, in the examples, only heavy drug use (like cocaine) sometimes led to recidivism. So I'll give this a medium weight because it's relevant but perhaps not as impactful as arrests or education.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him, which might indicate some coping mechanism or possibly lower recidivism if he's relying on faith. But in the examples, this factor didn't seem to have a strong influence either way, so I'll assign low weight here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem to be factors in the examples provided, so I can probably ignore those unless there's more context.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/convictions (high), lack of education (medium), living alone (low), recent drug use (medium), religious belief (low). The strongest factor is his four arrests and convictions. Looking at the examples where arrest counts were lower but still led to recidivism, I think this case would likely result in a \"YES\" prediction.\n\nFor confidence, since multiple high-weight factors are present, maybe around 70% seems reasonable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 4 times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college may reduce employability and social supports, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate limited support networks, but it's a less significant factor compared to others.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could be linked to criminal behavior and recidivism, though less so than harder drugs like cocaine in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide some deterrence but aren't a dominant factor in predicting recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
