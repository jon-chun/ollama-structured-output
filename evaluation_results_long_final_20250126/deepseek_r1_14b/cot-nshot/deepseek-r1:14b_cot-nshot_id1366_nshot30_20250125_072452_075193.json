    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's start by looking at each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, white. That might not be the most significant factor, but age can sometimes play a role since younger individuals might have less stability. But I don't see how her race directly affects this prediction, so maybe that's low impact.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, people with more arrests or convictions were more likely to recidivate. However, she only has one arrest, but it's a conviction, which might carry more weight. In previous cases, someone with one conviction sometimes led to a YES prediction if other factors are high, so this could be medium.\n\nShe is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. Physical stats don't seem directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided, so probably low.\n\nShe's never been married and currently lives alone. In some examples, living alone or with certain family structures didn't necessarily predict recidivism unless other factors were present. So this might be low as well.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education generally reduces recidivism rates, so this seems positive. The more education she gets, the lower the risk, so I'd rate this as low or maybe medium if it's seen as significant.\n\nShe held four jobs during the year. Employment can be protective against recidivism because stable work provides income and structure. This looks like a strong factor, so high weight here.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a big red flag for rearrest. In examples, people who used drugs were more likely to recidivate. So this should be high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior if untreated, but since she's not currently depressed, maybe low impact here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence outcomes. Urban areas might have more crime opportunities, so this could be medium.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Spirituality sometimes helps reduce recidivism, but it's not always consistent. So probably low impact here.\n\nNow, weighing these factors:\n\n- High school diploma and college enrollment: Low\n- Four jobs: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Arrest/conviction: Medium\n- Living alone: Low\n- Urban residence: Medium\n- Spirituality: Low\n- Age/race: Low\n\nLooking at the examples, when drug use was present (even if other factors were low), it often led to a YES. Her having a job is positive but might not outweigh the negative of drug use.\n\nIn example 17, someone with one arrest and conviction, employed, education, but used drugs\u2014led to NO. But maybe because she had more positive factors?\n\nWait, in another case, like example 27, she had no jobs, used drugs, led to NO. So it's inconsistent. Maybe the number of arrests isn't as high here.\n\nI'm leaning towards YES because drug use is a strong indicator, but her employment and education might mitigate that some. However, in examples where drug use was present, even with other positives, recidivism still happened.\n\nConfidence: Maybe around 65%? Because there are positive factors, but drug use is significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age may influence stability but not directly linked to recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction can be a risk factor but less severe than multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Holding four jobs indicates strong work ethic and stability, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as seen in examples.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are positive but may not strongly mitigate other risks here.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is neutral unless combined with other factors, which it isn't strongly here.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"Urban residence and past family environment could contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, so minimal impact on recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spirituality is generally protective but not a strong factor in these examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
