    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person re-arresting within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is a bit tricky because younger individuals might be more at risk, but 22 isn't extremely young. His race might not be the main factor here unless there are systemic issues, but I don't have data on that.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and convicted once. Arrests without convictions can sometimes indicate false charges or non-serious offenses, but a conviction shows he went through the legal system. Three arrests could be significant, especially if they're recent.\n\nHe stands at 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs. Body type isn't directly a risk factor unless it relates to physical altercations or substance use, which doesn't seem to apply here since he hasn't used drugs recently.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone might mean less support, but being single isn't inherently risky unless combined with other factors like isolation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment can be linked to future stability; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. Not enrolling in college could limit his opportunities.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Employment is generally protective against crime, so having two jobs shows some responsibility. But if the jobs are unstable or part-time, it might not provide enough income stability.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That\u2019s a strong positive factor as recent drug use can lead to criminal behavior related to obtaining drugs.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently. Depression symptoms could increase risk factors if left untreated, possibly leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have its challenges, but having stable parents can be protective. The household size of four isn't too large, which is typical in urban settings.\n\nHe considers God irrelevant personally, indicating low religious involvement. Religion can sometimes provide a support network and influence behavior, so this could be a slight negative factor.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some protective factors like employment and no recent drug use, but also risk factors like multiple arrests, depression symptoms, and living alone. His age is still young, which might make him more impulsive. I'd rate the overall risk as medium with about 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White male; race is not a direct indicator but can influence systemic factors\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Three arrests, indicating potential ongoing issues with law enforcement\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One conviction suggests legal involvement but not extreme severity\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"6'0\\\" and 170 lbs; no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Single; marital status alone is not a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support networks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma; education level can influence opportunities but not directly predictive here\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs; employment is generally protective, but recent job changes could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years; strong indicator of lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression; mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents; stable family background is protective\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"No belief in God's role personally; low religious involvement may have mixed effects but not a direct indicator\"),\n    (\"urban_living\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing can correlate with higher crime exposure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
