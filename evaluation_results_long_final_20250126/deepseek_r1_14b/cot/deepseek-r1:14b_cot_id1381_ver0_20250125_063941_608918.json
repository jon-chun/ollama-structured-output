    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this individual recidivating within three years. He's a 20-year-old Hispanic male with two arrests and one conviction. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are more likely to reoffend because they're still developing impulse control, so that might be a medium risk.\n\nHispanic ethnicity could be a factor depending on systemic issues, but without specific data linking it directly here, maybe low impact.\n\nArrest history: two arrests and one conviction. Convictions are strong predictors, so this is definitely high risk.\n\nEmployment: he's held three jobs in the year. Stable employment usually reduces recidivism, so that's a positive, low risk.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. Not great, but not terrible either; maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years. Recreational drug use is a risk factor, especially if it's recent, so medium here.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 as a child. Large family size can sometimes indicate more supervision or support, which might be protective. So low impact.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Some studies show religion can reduce recidivism, so that's a protective factor\u2014low risk.\n\nLiving alone and never married: living alone might mean less social support, which is a risk. Not sure how strong, but let's say medium.\n\nNo reported depression recently, which is good\u2014so low impact there.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are age and criminal history, which are significant. The other factors have some influence but not as strong. I'd lean towards predicting recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are more likely to reoffend due to ongoing development\"),\n    (\"ethnicity_hispanic\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor but may indicate systemic issues\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Convictions strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_multiple_jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce risk\"),\n    (\"education_high_school\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma indicates some education but no higher ed\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_household_size_4\", \"low\", \"Larger family size may offer more support\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone_unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"no_depression_reported\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
