    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male. Age is a big factor because younger adults are often more impulsive and have higher recidivism rates. Since he's in his early twenties, that could be a medium risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure how race plays into this specifically, but it might relate to systemic factors or stereotypes, though I think in risk assessment it's more about other variables like criminal history.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of recidivism. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis physical stats don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I'll skip those.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risk because of potential instability in living situations. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; lower education can be linked to higher recidivism. But since he has a GED and has held two jobs, maybe that's a bit mitigating but still leans towards medium risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, can be a red flag for potential criminal behavior. This is probably a high factor.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no recent depression might lower that risk, but I'm not sure how significant this single data point is.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4 as a child. Family environment can influence behavior; living in a larger family might have both positive and negative aspects, but without more info, it's probably medium.\n\nLastly, he doesn't see God's role in his life. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against crime, so lacking that perspective might be a slight risk factor, maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards high or medium risks. His multiple arrests and drug use are strong indicators. On the other hand, having held jobs and a GED slightly mitigate but not enough to lower overall risk. I think he's more likely than not to rearrest within three years, so prediction is \"YES\" with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can correlate with higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"number of prior arrests (8)\", \"high\", \"A high number of prior arrests strongly indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions reflect a history of criminal behavior that can influence future recidivism\"),\n    (\"lived with biological dad in a household of size 4\", \"medium\", \"Family dynamics and early\u751f\u6d3b\u73af\u5883can impact behavioral patterns, though this factor's influence is less direct\"),\n    (\"never married and living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and being unmarried may indicate a lack of social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"GED certificate, not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"While education can be protective, the lack of higher education enrollment might slightly increase risk\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment stability can be protective against recidivism, but two jobs may indicate marginal involvement\"),\n    (\"used drugs (marijuana) in past four years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior and recidivism\"),\n    (\"no reported depression over the past month\", \"low\", \"Lack of mental health issues can reduce risk, though this is a single data point\"),\n    (\"considers God has nothing to do with personal events\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can be protective, so lack thereof might slightly increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
