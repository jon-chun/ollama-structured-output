    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 21-year-old female over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21. Generally, younger individuals might have a higher risk because they're still developing socially and emotionally. But since she's a college student and has some responsibilities, maybe that mitigates it a bit. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNext, gender: being female usually means lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, low impact here.\n\nRace isn't directly a risk factor but can influence systemic factors. However, without more context on discrimination or bias, I might not assign a high weight. Maybe low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests do increase risk, especially if it's recent. This seems significant but not the highest. Medium here.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is protective against recidivism, so this should be a strong factor. High weight for this one.\n\nEmployment history: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a big risk factor. This might be high.\n\nSubstance use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major indicator, so high here.\n\nMental health: No depression reported recently. Positive mental health lowers risk. So low impact.\n\nFamily background: Lived with her mother in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates but without info on family dynamics or support, maybe medium? Or perhaps low since she's living alone now and has a stable education.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God influencing her life. This might indicate some coping mechanism, which is protective. So low impact.\n\nPutting it all together, the positive factors like education and possible protective ones like religion might balance out the negatives like unemployment and substance use. But I'm leaning towards she might not recidivate because of education and possibly strong support systems despite her past arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher risk but in this case, she is a college student\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor but can influence systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests are significant but need context\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college, which is protective\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year; unemployment is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a major indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area; urban areas may have higher crime exposure\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Consideration of God's role may provide a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
