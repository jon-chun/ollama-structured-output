    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but being in their late teens isn't too high unless other factors are present.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate that the charges were dismissed or he wasn't taken to trial, which might suggest less serious offenses or good legal representation. However, multiple arrests can still be a red flag for potential future issues.\n\nHeight and weight at 6'1\" and 160 lbs don't seem relevant on their own unless there's a correlation with crime types based on physical build, but I don't think that's significant here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor. Not being married at his age isn't unusual, but it could indicate some instability or lack of family involvement.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so not continuing education might be a moderate concern, but having a diploma is better than no formal education.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective against recidivism, as steady work provides income and structure. Two jobs might indicate he's trying hard, which is positive, but it could also mean he has limited options or is juggling responsibilities that might cause stress.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use is a significant risk factor for rearrest, especially if there's ongoing use or dependency. Marijuana can impair judgment and may lead to more criminal behavior, though typically less severe than harder drugs.\n\nIn the past month, he's felt down so much that nothing cheered him up. Depression or persistent sadness can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism or due to social withdrawal, making it a high risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more social issues, which might contribute to recidivism. The family structure here seems somewhat stable but could still be influenced by external factors.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious involvement or belief can sometimes correlate with higher risk because religious ties often provide support systems that reduce criminal behavior.\n\nNow, assigning weights: three arrests without convictions might suggest he's a low-hanging fruit for future convictions if he continues the pattern, so that's high. Drug use is also high as it directly relates to potential legal issues. Depression is another high factor as mental health significantly impacts behavior. Age and living alone are medium because they're somewhat indicative but not definitive. The other factors like employment and education are more protective or have lower impact.\n\nConsidering all these, the risk seems moderate to high. I'd predict a rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (19 years)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"number of arrests (3)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions may indicate a pattern or potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"drug use in past four years (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use is linked to higher recidivism risk, especially marijuana which can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"depression symptoms (felt down recently)\", \"high\", \"Depression can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism or due to social withdrawal\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but this factor is less significant compared to others\"),\n    (\"no religious belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement may correlate with higher risk, though not as impactful as other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
