    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best by breaking down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age can be a factor since younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates. But at 21, he's on the lower end of that spectrum. Race could play a role in systemic factors, but I'm not sure how much weight to give that here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction might indicate some level of risk, but it's not extensive. The fact that he was arrested suggests past behavior, but without multiple offenses, this might be a medium factor.\n\nHeight and weight aren't typically direct risk factors, so I'd probably assign low to those. He's living alone, which could mean less social support, potentially increasing risk, so maybe medium there.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is a red flag because lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. That might be a high factor. Not being enrolled in college also contributes, reinforcing the education issue as high.\n\nUnemployed for the past year is another strong indicator of potential recidivism since lack of employment can push someone back into crime. So that's high too.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs recently, which is positive, so low there. But he reported feeling down a lot in the past month, indicating possible mental health issues or stress, which could be a medium factor as it might affect his behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six in an urban area might mean exposure to more negative influences, possibly increasing risk, so medium. Lastly, his lack of religious belief isn't directly a risk factor but could influence coping mechanisms; maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either medium or high, leaning towards higher recidivism likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"21 years old is relatively young and may indicate higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not direct risk factors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED can be a strong indicator of higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate stress or mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may expose to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief is not directly a risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
