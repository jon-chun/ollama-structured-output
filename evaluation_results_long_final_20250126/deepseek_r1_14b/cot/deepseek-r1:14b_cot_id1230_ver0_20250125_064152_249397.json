Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be a sign, but without a conviction, it might indicate a first-time offense or maybe something dismissed. I'll mark that as low because there's no criminal record yet.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that in some contexts, race can be a factor due to systemic issues, so this is medium because it could influence risk but isn't the sole determinant.\n\nAge 21 is young, and younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates. That's another medium factor.\n\nCurrently living alone with no spouse means he doesn't have traditional support systems in place, which can be a risk. Medium here too.\n\nNo job history for the past year suggests economic instability, which is linked to crime. High impact because unemployment can push someone towards illegal activities.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college indicates limited education beyond high school. Education can affect employability and thus recidivism. Low impact since he has a diploma, which is better than none.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive; substance abuse is a major risk factor. So low here.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is good mental health, reducing risk. Low again.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area of size 4\u2014urban areas have higher crime rates, and family structure can influence behavior. Medium because it's a mix of environment and support.\n\nBelieving God influences his life might indicate strong beliefs that could deter crime. That's low as positive factors against recidivism.\n\nLooking at all these, the majority are medium or low except unemployment, which is high. But the lack of criminal history and positive factors like education and mental health help mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards predicting no rearrest but with moderate confidence because while there are several mitigating factors, his unemployment and living situation could still pose a risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which may correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Identifying as Black can be a factor in systemic issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history_conviction\", \"low\", \"No conviction despite one arrest\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No job history for the past year indicates economic instability\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no spouse may lack support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences his life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
