    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, but it's also a time when people can start getting more settled. So I'd say medium here since it's a bit of a double-edged sword.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. Generally, males have higher recidivism rates than females, so this is a protective factor. That would be low risk.\n\nRace is White. There isn't much data suggesting race alone affects recidivism beyond other factors like socioeconomic status or crime type. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted once. A single conviction can be a significant risk factor, so medium here makes sense because it shows she's had some brushes with the law before.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 135 lbs. These are typical stats for a young woman, no indication of any issues related to physical size that would affect crime propensity. So low risk here.\n\nMarital status is unmarried, living alone.\u672a\u5a5a\u4e14\u72ec\u5c45\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u8003\u8651\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u72ec\u81ea\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u72af\u7f6a\u3002\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college.\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6bd5\u4e1a\u4e0d\u7b97\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6ca1\u7ee7\u7eed\u6df1\u9020\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5979\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\nEmployment: held four jobs in a year.\u9891\u7e41\u6362\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u5c31\u4e1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5979\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine\u8fc7\u53bb\u56db\u5e74\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u6709\u65f6\u60c5\u7eea\u4f4e\u843d\u3002\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u6cd5\u836f\u7269\u5982\u5927\u9ebb\u548c\u53ef\u5361\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u518d\u6b21\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nEmotional state: \u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u6709\u65f6\u60c5\u7eea\u4f4e\u843d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7edd\u671b\u3002\u60c5\u7eea\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5979\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u518d\u6b21\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nFamily background: \u5bb6\u5ead\u4eba\u53e3\u591a\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u65f6\u4f4f\u5728\u56db\u53e3\u4e4b\u5bb6\u3002\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nReligious belief: \u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0a\u5e1d\u5728\u5979\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u662f\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u5408\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u5979\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5979\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u6027\u522b\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5979\u518d\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u201cYES\u201d\uff0c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5ea6\u5927\u7ea6\u572865%\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is a young adult, which can be a time of instability but also potential for growth\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism without other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction are indicative of past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may limit employment opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in a year suggests potential instability or difficulty maintaining steady employment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression may indicate stressors that could contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Coming from a household of size 4 does not inherently indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective, promoting positive behavior and social connections\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
