    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are at a higher risk, especially if they're just starting out in their criminal behavior. So that's a medium factor because it's somewhat significant but not extremely high.\n\nRace might be considered, but I should approach this carefully. There's a lot of debate around racial disparities in the justice system, so while race can be a socioeconomic indicator, it's not directly a risk factor on its own without more context. So maybe low impact here unless other factors influence.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest is lower than multiple arrests, but a conviction indicates he did commit a crime, which increases the likelihood of recidivism. That seems like a medium factor because it's relevant but not the highest.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. Unless there's something about physical presence affecting crime type, but in this case, they're neutral factors. So low impact.\n\nLiving situation: He lives alone without being married. Being alone might mean less support, which can be a risk factor. Medium here because social isolation can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low education is linked with higher crime rates and lower employability, so this is a medium to high factor. Probably medium because it's significant but not the highest.\n\nEmployment history: He has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective against recidivism, but having only two jobs might indicate instability or part-time work. So low impact as he does have some employment, which is generally a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: No drug use in four years. That's positive and reduces risk, so low factor because it's a protective element.\n\nMental health: He felt down in the dumps recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. So medium impact as recent symptoms might indicate ongoing struggles.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with his biological mother in an urban area of size 4. Urban areas have higher crime rates, and family environment can influence behavior. That's a low factor because it's more about context than direct risk factors.\n\nReligious belief: He believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious involvement is often protective against recidivism. So this is a low factor as it's a positive influence.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the main factors are age (medium), arrest/conviction (medium), education level (medium), and mental health (medium). Other factors have lower impacts or are protective.\n\nI would predict that he might recidivate because several moderate risk factors point towards potential issues. My confidence is around 60% because while there are significant risks, there are also some protective factors like employment and religious beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are more likely to reoffend compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"low\", \"Race can be a socioeconomic indicator but not directly a risk factor without additional context\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicate past criminal behavior, increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone_unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, a potential risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Low education is linked to higher crime rates and lower employability\"),\n    (\"employment_two_jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment history shows some stability, which can be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_last_4_years\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_recent_low\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression may indicate mental health struggles, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"family_background_small_city\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing can be a contextual factor but not directly a risk indicator\"),\n    (\"religious_belief_importance\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement is generally protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
