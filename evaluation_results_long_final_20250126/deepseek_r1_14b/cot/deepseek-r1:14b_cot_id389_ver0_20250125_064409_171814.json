    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's recidivism. He's a 22-year-old White male with one arrest and conviction. Let me break down each piece of information.\n\nFirst, his age is 22, which is on the younger side but not extremely young. I know that younger offenders are often at higher risk because they might have less stability and more impulsivity.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted. That's a point against him since having any prior conviction can increase recidivism chances. But it's only one offense, so maybe not too severe.\n\nLooking at his demographics: White males generally don't have the same high recidivism rates as other groups, but race isn't the main factor here. It's more about socioeconomic and behavioral factors.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 165 lbs\u2014nothing stands out here in terms of physical attributes affecting risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. That could be a risk because living alone might mean less social support, but he's only been living alone for a short time. Not sure how significant this is.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can play a role; higher education is often protective against recidivism. But having a diploma is better than nothing, so maybe not too bad.\n\nHe held 3 jobs in the past year. That's positive because steady employment is associated with lower recidivism. Having multiple jobs might indicate he's trying to establish himself but could also be a sign of instability if moving between jobs quickly.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. No substance abuse is a big plus, as drugs often contribute to criminal behavior. Not feeling depressed is also good for mental health stability.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of 4 in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk factor. Family structure and socioeconomic status can influence recidivism, so this might weigh as medium.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him. Religious beliefs can act as both a protective factor (providing support and purpose) or maybe influence in ways that affect behavior.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Young age: high\n- Prior conviction: high\n- Employment: medium (3 jobs might show instability)\n- Rural upbringing: medium\n- Education: low (high school diploma is decent)\n- Living alone: low\n- No drug use/depression: low\n\nPutting it all together, the positives are employment and no substance abuse. The negatives include being young, having a conviction, living alone, and rural background.\n\nThe prediction would likely be YES for rearrest because the high factors (age and prior conviction) outweigh the positive ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"22 is relatively young, which can correlate with higher impulsivity and recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"One prior conviction indicates a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs may indicate instability but also responsibility\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone for a short time might not significantly impact risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma shows some educational stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently supports emotional stability\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a rural household of 4 may indicate limited resources and support\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing God's influence can provide personal structure but might also lead to rigid views\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
