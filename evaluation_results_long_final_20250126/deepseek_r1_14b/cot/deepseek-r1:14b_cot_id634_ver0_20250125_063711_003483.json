    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly low. Some factors may indicate higher risk at younger ages due to instability, but others might see it as moderate.\n\nHispanic ethnicity isn't a direct indicator of risk on its own, so I'll rate that as low unless there are specific cultural or systemic factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, which is a relevant factor. A single conviction could be a medium risk because prior convictions do correlate with higher recidivism rates but aren't definitive.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'9\" and 180 lbs\u2014are typical and don't directly impact recidivism, so low here.\n\nMarital status as married might slightly reduce risk since stable relationships can deter crime. I'll note that as a medium factor because it's positive but not the strongest indicator.\n\nHaving a GED without college enrollment could be a medium risk factor. Education level is important, and lack of further education might indicate limited opportunities or higher vulnerability to recidivism.\n\nEmployment history shows he held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is generally protective against recidivism, so I'll consider this as a low risk because it's a positive sign but not the strongest factor on its own.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a significant concern. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so I'll rate that high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently suggests lower mental health issues, which can reduce recidivism risk. So this is low.\n\nLiving situation at a young age with non-biological parents in a household of size 2 might indicate some instability or lack of support, potentially increasing risk. I'll consider this medium because it's an early-life factor that could have long-term effects.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with personal events might reflect lower spiritual support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. I'll rate this as low but note its potential impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high and medium risks point towards possible recidivism, so I predict \"YES.\" The confidence is around 60% because while there are several moderate indicators, some protective factors like employment and marriage may mitigate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely low in terms of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone is not a direct indicator of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history can be a moderate risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'9\\\" and 180 lbs does not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being married may indicate some stability, but it's not a strong protective factor alone\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED without college enrollment could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year suggests some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use over the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month reduces potential risk\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement_history\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents at a young age may indicate some instability or lack of support, contributing to moderate risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has no personal influence can be seen as low in terms of protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
