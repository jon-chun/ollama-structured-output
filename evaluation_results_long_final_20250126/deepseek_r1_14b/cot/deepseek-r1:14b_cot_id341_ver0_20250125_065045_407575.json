    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Let me start by listing all the given information:\n\n- Age: 21 years old.\n- Gender: Male.\n- Race: White.\n- Arrested twice, no convictions.\n- Height: 5'10\", Weight: 195 lbs.\n- Never married, living alone.\n- Education: GED, not in college.\n- Unemployed for the past year.\n- Drug use in the last four years (marijuana and cocaine).\n- Not felt depressed in the past month.\n- grew up with biological mother in a household of 7 people in an urban area.\n\nNow, I need to assign weights: low, medium, or high to each risk factor based on their potential influence on rearrest within three years. \n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, so this could be a moderate factor.\n\nRace might play a role in some contexts, but I'm cautious about overemphasizing it unless there's specific data indicating otherwise. So maybe low impact here.\n\nNo convictions despite two arrests suggests he hasn't been found guilty, which is positive but not conclusive. Maybe medium since arrests are still present but no convictions.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism as far as I know, so probably low impact.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk factors\u2014so maybe medium here.\n\nGED education isn't a strong negative indicator on its own, but lack of higher education could be a factor. Maybe low to medium.\n\nUnemployed for a year is concerning because unemployment can link to crime. That's probably a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse often correlates with recidivism, so high here.\n\nNo depression reported recently might be a protective factor, but it's not directly related to other crimes, so maybe low impact.\n\nGrowing up in a large household in an urban area could contribute to higher exposure to negative influences. That seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high unemployment and drug use stand out as strong indicators. The other factors add up but aren't as impactful. So overall, I think there's a moderate to high chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race generally not a strong predictor unless other factors are present\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest possible repeat behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education_ged\", \"low\", \"GED education is a basic level but not strongly indicative of recidivism\"),\n    (\"unemployed_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment for a year is a strong indicator of potential criminal activity\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is highly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a large household may contribute to higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
