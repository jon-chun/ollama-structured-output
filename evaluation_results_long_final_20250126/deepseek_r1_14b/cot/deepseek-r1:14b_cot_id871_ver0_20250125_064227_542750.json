    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female being rearrested in the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know that race can be a factor, but it's tricky because it's not about individual responsibility but systemic issues. So I'm thinking maybe medium here because of potential biases in the system, but I'm not sure if it's high or low.\n\nShe's been arrested 7 times and convicted. That seems significant. Multiple arrests usually indicate higher risk, so this should be a high factor.\n\nAge is 18. She\u2019s young, which might mean she's still establishing herself and could continue engaging in criminal behavior. But I'm not certain how much weight to give age compared to other factors.\n\nShe lives alone without being married. Lack of support from a spouse or partner might increase her risk, so that would probably be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism; lower education can mean fewer opportunities, so this should be high.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential criminal activity because it limits options. So definitely high here.\n\nUsed drugs (cocaine) recently. Drug use, especially current cocaine use, increases the risk. This feels like a high factor.\n\nShe's felt down in the dumps all month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so medium here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a rural area with 5 siblings. Family environment might not be as impactful if she has support, but I'm not sure about this one\u2014maybe low or medium.\n\nFeels God isn't involved in her life. Lack of strong spiritual support could affect her coping mechanisms, so probably medium.\n\nNow, looking at all these factors, several are high (arrests, education, unemployment, drug use) and a couple are medium. The prediction is likely YES for rearrest because multiple high-risk factors are present. Confidence might be around 70% because while there are strong indicators, some factors like race and spirituality are less certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Potential systemic biases may influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youth may correlate with ongoing criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation_marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marital support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education reduces opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is linked to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use_recency\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with parents in a rural area might provide some stability\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual support could affect coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year.
