    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. I know that younger offenders are often at higher risk because they might not have as many life experiences or be as settled. So that's a medium weight.\n\nNext, he's white. Race can sometimes be a factor, but in this context, being white doesn't necessarily mean higher risk compared to other groups, so maybe low impact here.\n\nHe's been arrested once without a conviction. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it might not carry as much weight. I'll rate that as medium.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 155 lbs. These aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism, so low.\n\nNever married and living alone. His marital status could be relevant, but since he's never been married, it might not indicate instability. Living alone might mean less support, which is a bit concerning, so I'll give that a medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can influence opportunities and recidivism rates. High school completion is better than none, but lack of further education could be a risk factor. Medium here.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Employment is generally protective against reoffending. Having two jobs shows he's trying to stay on track, so that's low risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. This should be high weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to reoffending, but since he's not depressed now, this might mitigate some risk. Still, I'll rate it as low.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can influence behavior, but given that he's 20 and living alone now, maybe the family environment didn't prevent past issues. So medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Some studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism. This is a protective factor, so low impact but positive.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicator is drug use. His age and prior arrest are also concerning. Positive factors include employment and possibly religion. But given the significant risk from substance abuse and past arrest, I think he's likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism as they may have less stability and experience\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race is not a direct indicator of recidivism likelihood in this context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest, even without conviction, can indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_single_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support systems which could contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"education_high_school_diploma\", \"medium\", \"While having a high school diploma is better than no education, the absence of further education can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_two_jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment history shows stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use Marijuana_cocaine\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_no_depression\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background_with_parents_urban\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological parents in an urban area may have contributed to past behavior but does not directly predict future outcomes\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_God_influence\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can serve as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
