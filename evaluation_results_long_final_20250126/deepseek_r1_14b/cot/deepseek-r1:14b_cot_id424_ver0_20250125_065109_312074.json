    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly high risk in that range. Gender being female might lower the risk as women generally have lower recidivism rates. Race here doesn't seem to be a significant factor on its own.\n\nArrest history shows four arrests without convictions. While arrests can indicate potential for future crimes, lack of convictions suggests no proven criminal behavior. This should be considered but not overly weighted.\n\nEducation-wise, she hasn't finished high school or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism, so this is a medium factor.\n\nEmployment: She's held two jobs. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, making this a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high.\n\nMental health-wise, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. No severe mental illness reported here, so low impact.\n\nLiving situation: Not living alone, possibly with family or others. This could provide support but might also mean more supervision. Medium factor since it's mixed.\n\nFamily background includes living in an urban area with her biological mother and two siblings. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which is a medium risk due to environmental influences.\n\nReligious belief that God has something to do with her life might indicate strong personal beliefs, potentially reducing recidivism. However, the impact here isn't as significant, so low factor.\n\nConsidering all factors, substance abuse is the strongest indicator pointing towards high risk. The lack of education and unstable living situation also contribute moderately. Her young age and female gender slightly offset but aren't enough to outweigh the negatives. \n\nI would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is relatively young but not extremely low risk in this context\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"4 arrests without convictions suggest potential but no proven criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs indicates some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month suggests no current mental health issues\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate some level of supervision or support, but could also mean more scrutiny\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a biological mother and siblings can be correlated with higher crime exposure\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs might provide a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
