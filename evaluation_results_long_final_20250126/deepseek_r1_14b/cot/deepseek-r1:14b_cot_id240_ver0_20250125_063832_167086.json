    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are at a higher risk, but not extremely so compared to someone in their teens. So that might be medium.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. Ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, but it's a sensitive area and often considered after controlling for other factors, so maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. An arrest without conviction could indicate lower risk since there's no formal finding of guilt. That might be low.\n\nHeight is 5'9\" and weight 215 lbs. Body type isn't a direct factor, unless it relates to physical altercations, which I don't have info on, so probably low.\n\nNever married. Marital status can affect recidivism; married individuals often have lower rates, but being unmarried doesn't necessarily mean high risk. Medium maybe?\n\nNot living alone suggests he's dependent on others for support, which might reduce risk since he has a social network. That could be low or medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education can impact recidivism\u2014higher education usually lowers it. Without further education, perhaps medium risk here.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism. Having a job might lower his risk, so that's probably low.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently. Both are positive indicators. So these should be low risk factors.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Family environment can influence behavior. Urban areas have higher crime rates, but without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's a medium factor maybe.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that should be low.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors are either low or medium. The arrest is a concern, but no conviction softens that. Employment and lack of drug use are positives. So overall, the risk seems moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; young adults may be at higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity is considered but not a direct indicator of risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married can be associated with higher risk but varies by individual\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate lack of stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment could impact future prospects\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job in the past year shows some responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother may impact behavior\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role can provide support and reduce risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
