    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person re-arresting in the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From what I know, younger offenders, especially those in their early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not have stable lives yet. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's male. Studies show that men are more likely to commit crimes than women. That definitely adds another high point here.\n\nRace is White. I've heard that race can influence arrest rates due to systemic issues, but it's a bit tricky because it's not solely about the individual. Still, being part of a demographic with higher incarceration rates could be a medium factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Prior arrests are a strong indicator of future issues. Conventions say each prior conviction increases risk, so that's high.\n\nHeight is 5'10\" and weight 160 lbs. Physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'd rate this as low.\n\nNever married, living alone. Being single and not having dependents can mean less accountability, which might increase the chance of re-offending. That's a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is a known factor; higher education usually reduces recidivism. Without college, it's a medium risk here.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year. Stable employment is good and lowers recidivism, so this is low risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major red flag because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. High risk here.\n\nNo depression reported recently. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but since he's not depressed now, it's a low factor.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in a rural area. Family stability usually helps, but rural areas might have higher crime rates or less access to resources. It's a bit conflicting, so I'll put this as medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement is often protective against crime, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either medium or high, especially prior arrests and drug use. I think the chance of rearrest is likely, so prediction is YES with around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"21 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"males have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals may face systemic issues influencing arrests\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"two arrests and one conviction indicate potential for repeat offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes not directly linked to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone may reduce accountability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"lack of higher education can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"stable employment generally reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression recently\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\u6210\u957f\u73af\u5883\", \"medium\", \"growing up in a rural area with both parents may have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"religious involvement is generally protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
