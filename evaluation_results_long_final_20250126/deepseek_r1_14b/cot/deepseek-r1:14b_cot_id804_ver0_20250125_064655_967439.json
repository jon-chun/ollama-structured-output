    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment step by step. I need to carefully evaluate each factor provided for the individual in question and assign a relative weight of low, medium, or high to each. Then, based on these factors, predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years and provide a confidence level.\n\nFirst, looking at her age: 22. Generally, younger adults are more likely to reoffend, but 22 isn't extremely young, so I'd consider this a medium factor.\n\nNext, she's female. Gender can play a role in recidivism rates, with some studies showing that women often have lower recidivism rates than men. So, gender might be a low factor here.\n\nHer mixed race identity is next. There isn't strong evidence linking race to recidivism directly, so this could be low impact.\n\nShe has been arrested 7 times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions is a significant red flag for future offenses. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'4\" and 139 lbs\u2014are not typically predictive of criminal behavior, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Divorce might indicate some instability or past issues in relationships, but living alone could mean she has more independence. This is probably a medium factor.\n\nHaving a GED instead of a college degree might affect her employment prospects and opportunities, which can influence recidivism. So, this would be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs in the last year, which shows some stability and responsibility. This is a positive sign, so it's a low factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years is great\u2014substance abuse is a major contributor to crime, so her clean record here should be considered low risk.\n\nHer recent emotional state: feeling down for most of the past month. Prolonged sadness can be a stress indicator that might lead someone to commit crimes out of desperation or as a coping mechanism. This could be medium.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 3 with her biological mother. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more specific info on dysfunction, I'll rate this low.\n\nLastly, she believes God has a role in her life events. Religious involvement is often linked to lower recidivism rates because it provides support and structure. So, this is a low factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high arrest and conviction history stands out as a major indicator. While some other factors like emotional state and living situation are medium, they don't outweigh the significant criminal history. Therefore, I would predict she will rearrest (YES) with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is in a high risk age range for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"being female generally has lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"mixed race identity does not strongly correlate with recidivism trends\"),\n    (\"criminal_history_arrests\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and convictions indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are not directly predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"divorced and living alone may suggest some instability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED without college enrollment could limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"having held 2 jobs shows some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"feeling down consistently may indicate stress or potential coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"low\", \"growing up in a household of 3 with biological mother is neutral\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"belief in God's role may provide support but not strongly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
