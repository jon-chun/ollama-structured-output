    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this individual re-arresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. That's a key factor because younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates, so that's a high weight.\n\nRace is Black. While race shouldn't be a determinant, it can correlate with systemic issues, so I'll give this a medium weight based on statistical data showing disparities.\n\nPrevious arrests: he's been arrested twice and convicted once. Both arrests are significant for predicting future offenses, so that's high as well.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact risk but might relate to physical presence in certain crimes, so low weight here.\n\nMarital status is single, not married. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risk, so medium weight.\n\nLiving alone: living alone might mean less support, which could be a medium factor for potential relapse.\n\nEducation level: he has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Lower education can link to fewer opportunities, so that's medium.\n\nEmployment: he held one job during the year. Stable employment is protective, so if he's employed, it's low risk.\n\nDrug use: no usage in four years and not depressed recently. These are positive signs, so low weight for both factors.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological father in a rural area of three people. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info, it's medium.\n\nReligious views: he believes God is involved in his life. Positive beliefs can deter crime, so that's low risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the positives like employment and no drug use are present, which lower the risk. However, the high number of arrests, young age, race, and living alone might push it towards a higher recidivism chance. I'm leaning towards predicting yes with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"20 years old is a high risk factor as younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Being Black can correlate with systemic issues and disparities in the criminal justice system, though not a direct determinant\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of law violations increasing risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size is less directly correlated with recidivism unless linked to specific offenses\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to potential lack of family support\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate fewer social supports, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college may limit opportunities and increase vulnerability\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment history suggests some stability though only one job was held recently\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is a positive factor reducing risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently indicates current mental health is not a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with biological father and rural upbringing may influence behavior but data limited\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role in personal life can act as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
