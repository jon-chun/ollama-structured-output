    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this person re-arresting in the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. That's pretty young, but not super low like a teenager. So maybe medium? But wait, younger people might have higher recidivism rates because they're still establishing themselves, so maybe high. I think the example said high for age under 30, so yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNext, being White. Race can be a factor, but it's more about systemic issues rather than individual risk. So probably low weight here.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. That's definitely a strong indicator of higher risk. So high weight for this one because convictions are serious.\n\nHeight and weight are both within average ranges. I don't think these directly correlate with crime, so low weight for both.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can be a factor; single people might have lower support systems. But it's not as strong as arrest history. So medium? Wait, the example had it as low, maybe because he's just living alone but no other issues there. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is linked to recidivism because lack of education can limit opportunities. That should be a medium weight. Maybe even higher if education is a big factor.\n\nFour jobs in a year. Unstable employment might indicate issues, but four jobs could mean he's trying to make ends meet or has some initiative. So maybe medium? Or perhaps low because it shows he's working, but not consistently enough.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently. That's positive; substance abuse is a big risk factor when present, so absence of it would be low.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area as a kid. Family environment can influence behavior. Urban areas might have more crime exposure, but without knowing the family dynamics, it's hard to say. Maybe medium because growing up in an urban setting could contribute.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spirituality can be both protective (lowers risk) or sometimes a sign of delusional thinking which is bad. But generally, religion can reduce recidivism, so maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: the high factors are age and prior convictions. The medium ones include education level and possibly living alone. The rest are low. So overall, the risk seems higher because of past behavior and age.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is often associated with higher recidivism rates as individuals may still be in a developmental stage\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race can be a systemic factor, but individual risk factors are more significant here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate higher recidivism potential\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height does not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, but no other indicators suggest instability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Four jobs show activity but not consistent employment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family dynamics can influence behavior, though specifics are unknown\"),\n    (\"spirituality_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can sometimes reduce recidivism but is context-dependent\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
