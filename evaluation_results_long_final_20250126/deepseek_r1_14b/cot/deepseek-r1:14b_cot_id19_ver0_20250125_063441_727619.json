    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk of a 20-year-old male recidivating within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. I know that younger offenders are often at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, but 20 isn't too young for adult responsibilities. So maybe low impact here.\n\nRace isn't a direct indicator of recidivism risk, so probably no impact there.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested four times and convicted once. That seems significant because prior convictions are strong predictors. I'd rate this high.\n\nHeight and weight don't correlate with criminal behavior on their own, so low impact.\n\nMarital status\u2014never married, living alone. Not being married can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not the strongest. Maybe medium.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Low socioeconomic status can be a factor, but education alone might have a low impact here.\n\nEmployment: He held five jobs in a year. That shows some instability, which could indicate higher risk. I'd say medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and is currently down. Substance abuse is a major red flag for recidivism. Definitely high impact.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with both parents in an urban area. Not sure if that's positive or negative, but maybe low impact unless there were issues.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't think God is involved. Low socioeconomic factors might play here, but I'm not sure it's a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are prior convictions and drug use. Employment instability adds to that, so overall, he's at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"low\", \"Age is relatively young but not extremely low for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race is generally not a direct predictor of recidivism risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk on their own\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can be a moderate risk factor, but it's context-dependent\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_in_college\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a basic level of education; not in college might indicate some instability or lack of future plans\"),\n    (\"held_five_jobs_past_year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could be a moderate risk factor indicating potential difficulties maintaining steady employment\"),\n    (\"past_four_years_drug_use_marijuana_cocaine\", \"high\", \"Recent and consistent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"currently_feeling_down_depressed_last_month\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to higher recidivism risk as it may affect decision-making and coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"grew_up_with_biological_parents_urban_household_size_four\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an urban household with both biological parents might have some protective factors but is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"god_has_nothing_to_do_with_him\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement may correlate with lower social support, but it's generally a low impact factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
