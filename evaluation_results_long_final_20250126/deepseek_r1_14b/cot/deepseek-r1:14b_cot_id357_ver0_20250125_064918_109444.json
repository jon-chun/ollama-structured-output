    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male. Age is a factor because younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates since they're still developing and may not have stable lives yet.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't know if race plays into risk assessment here; it's more about other factors like criminal history, socioeconomic status, etc.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant because even if he wasn't convicted each time, the arrests themselves can indicate a higher likelihood of future issues.\n\nHeight and weight aren't directly related to recidivism unless they're linked to physical altercations or gang involvement, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Lack of marriage might not be a strong factor, but living alone could mean less social support, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a known factor; higher education can reduce recidivism. Not being enrolled might indicate he's not seeking further education, which could be a risk.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year, which suggests some stability and responsibility. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be a positive factor.\n\nDrugs: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can correlate with higher recidivism, especially if it's ongoing or part of a criminal network. But he only mentions marijuana, which might carry less severe penalties than harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so no current mental health issues are evident, which is good because mental illness can increase risk.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household size of five. Urban areas may have higher crime rates, but living with both parents could be protective. However, larger families might mean more challenges or less attention per child, depending on the family dynamics.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events, which relates to lack of religious involvement. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can reduce recidivism, so this might slightly increase risk.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Age 19: High (young age linked to higher recidivism).\n- Criminal history (2 arrests, 1 conviction): High (multiple arrests and convictions indicate potential for future issues).\n- Employment (held two jobs): Medium (positive factor but not the strongest protective measure).\n- Drug use (marijuana recently): Medium (some risk but less severe than harder drugs).\n- Living alone: Medium (lack of support might contribute to higher risk).\n- Education (high school diploma, no college): Low (but not as strong a protective factor as higher education).\n- Family background (urban, both parents): Low (living with parents can be protective despite urban area).\n- Religious beliefs: Low (lack of involvement may slightly increase risk but is minor).\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high and medium risks are pointing towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. The positive factors like employment might help, but the negatives are more impactful.\n\nSo prediction would likely be YES for rearrest within three years with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19-year-old may have higher recidivism tendency\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"2 arrests, 1 conviction indicating potential\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Stable employment but not strong protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use linked to risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"No spousal support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, no college\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents\"),\n    (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious ties slightly increases risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
