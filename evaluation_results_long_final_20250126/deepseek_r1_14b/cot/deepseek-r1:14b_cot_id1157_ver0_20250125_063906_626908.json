    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment step by step. I'm going to break down each factor the individual presented, assign a weight, and then make a prediction based on that.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Young adults are often at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet, but since she's only been arrested once without conviction, this could be low to medium.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic, which sometimes can be a factor in certain communities, but I don't see any direct indication of gang involvement or prior issues here, so maybe low impact.\n\nNo convictions despite an arrest. That's a positive sign because it suggests she might not have a criminal mindset beyond that one incident. This should probably be a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 isn't uncommon, but having support systems in place is important. She has a high school diploma and hasn't been married, which are neutral factors unless there's more context about her social support.\n\nShe held one job during the year, indicating some stability. Employment can be protective against recidivism, so this should lower her risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, especially if it's recent. This might be a medium to high factor.\n\nShe experienced depression symptoms recently, feeling down for days. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior as coping mechanisms, so this could be medium to high risk.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with five siblings and her biological mother\u2014crowded households can sometimes lead to higher stress and potential exposure to negative influences. This might lean towards medium risk.\n\nHer belief that God has a role in her life suggests she's spiritual or religious. Research shows that strong religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism, so this should be low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use and mental health are significant risks, while employment and religious beliefs are positive factors. I'm leaning towards medium risk for rearrest within three years with about 50-60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a factor but not significantly high here as she has no prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity_Hispanic\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is generally not a strong predictor of recidivism unless compounded by other factors.\"),\n    (\"no_conviction_despite_arrest\", \"high\", \"No conviction despite an arrest suggests possible first-time offense and lower likelihood of repeat behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employed_one_job_past_year\", \"low\", \"Employment is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's ongoing.\"),\n    (\"depressive_symptoms_past_month\", \"medium\", \"Depressive symptoms can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_large_household\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with multiple siblings may indicate exposure to negative influences, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs_God_influence\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can be protective against recidivism by providing a sense of purpose and accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
