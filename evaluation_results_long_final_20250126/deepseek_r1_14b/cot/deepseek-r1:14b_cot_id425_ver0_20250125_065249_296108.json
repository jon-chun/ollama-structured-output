    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male over three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a key factor. He's 18, which is young but still an adult. Young adults are more likely to commit crimes due to impulsive behavior, so that might be a medium risk.\n\nNext, race. The data I know shows higher arrest rates for Black individuals, but the White category isn't as high. However, it's not just about race; other factors matter too. So I'll consider this low unless other factors change things.\n\nArrest history: He was arrested once but no conviction. Arrests can predict future issues, especially without a conviction, which might indicate a lack of intent or first-time offense. That leans medium because an arrest is significant but not necessarily leading to a conviction.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime risk, so that's low.\n\nMarital status: He's single and living alone. No spouse or partner could mean less accountability, possibly increasing risk, but it's probably a minor factor. Medium here?\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low education is linked to higher recidivism because of limited opportunities. That should be high.\n\nEmployment: He held two jobs in the year. Stable employment can reduce risk, so this is low.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana recently. Drug use often correlates with criminal activity for obtaining drugs or related crimes. So medium here.\n\nMental health: No depression reported, which is positive. Low impact on risk.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area of size 5. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates. Mixed factors, so medium.\n\nReligious views: Doesn't see God's role in his life. Lack of strong religious ties can correlate with higher risk because religion often provides support and guidance. So medium.\n\nNow, considering all these, most are low to medium. The highest is education level. I'm leaning towards a prediction of NO rearrest but with some uncertainty. Confidence might be around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; young adults may have higher risk due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals generally have lower recidivism rates compared to other groups, but this factor alone is not strong\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential for future issues but may indicate first-time offense\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone could indicate less accountability, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED and no college enrollment is strongly associated with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs shows some stability but not a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may indicate potential for drug-related offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in an urban area with both parents; mixed impact on risk\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may correlate with higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
