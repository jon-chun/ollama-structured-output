    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. I know that younger offenders are at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, so that's a high factor.\n\nNext, race: he identifies as Black. There's some disparity in the criminal justice system, but it's more about systemic factors than individual risk. So probably medium here.\n\nArrest history: He was arrested once but no conviction. Arrests can indicate potential issues, so I'll rate this medium because a single arrest isn't definitive but still significant.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. So low here.\n\nEmployment: He's held two jobs in the year. Stable employment is good, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's recent. That's medium.\n\nMental health: He felt down in the dumps recently. Mental health issues can increase the risk of reoffending, so that's high.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is protective, but living in an urban area might have its own challenges. So medium here.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God involved in his life. Religion can be a protective factor against recidivism, so low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are age and mental health. The mediums include race, arrest history, family background, and drug use. The lows are education and employment, with religion also being low but positive. Considering these, the risk is probably higher than not. So I'd predict YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"high\", \"Age 20 is a high risk factor as younger individuals are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"medium\", \"Race can be a factor due to systemic issues, but not the primary determinant\"),\n    (\"arrest_count_one\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest increases risk, though no conviction may mitigate it\"),\n    (\"education_high_school\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_multiple_jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates stability and lower risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana_past_four_years\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_down_in_dumps_recently\", \"high\", \"Mental health struggles can significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_lived_with_both_parents_urban\", \"medium\", \"Family background and urban setting may contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_God_involved\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs are generally protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
