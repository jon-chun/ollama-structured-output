    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely low. Typically, younger offenders have higher recidivism rates, so that\u2019s a medium risk.\n\nRace might be a factor here. Sometimes in some models, race can influence outcomes, but I'm cautious because it's sensitive. If included, it would probably be low as it's more about other variables like socioeconomic status.\n\nNumber of prior arrests is 5 times. That's significant; multiple arrests usually indicate higher risk. So that\u2019s a high factor.\n\nConviction history is present, which means he has been through the system before, increasing the likelihood of rearrest. High again.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime unless it's for a specific offense like burglary where size might be an advantage. But generally, not a major factor\u2014so low.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Unmarried individuals, especially without children, might have lower social ties, so medium risk here.\n\nEducation level is GED and no college enrollment. Lower education can correlate with higher recidivism. Medium.\n\nEmployment: held one job in the year. Steady employment is good but if he's only had one, it might not be stable enough. Still, it's better than unemployment, so low.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so high here.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the last month. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but absence of current symptoms is positive\u2014low.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological parents in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so maybe medium. But family stability might mitigate that a bit.\n\nReligious belief: he believes God has something to do with his life. Religious involvement can be protective against crime, so low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are prior arrests and drug use, which significantly increase the chance. Convictions also play a role but maybe not as much as the others. The positive factors like employment and religion might lower the risk a bit. Overall, I think he's at a moderate to high risk. So predicting \"YES\" with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race is considered a sensitive factor but not the primary determinant of recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 arrests on record, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Convicted multiple times, which correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size does not directly correlate with recidivism unless tied to specific offenses\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate weaker social ties\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED but no college enrollment; lower education levels can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job in the year, indicating some stability but not extensive history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is strongly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in an urban area with both biological parents; urban environments may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
