    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign risk factors for a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old White male. Age is a factor because younger offenders are often at higher risk, but since he's on the lower end (early adulthood), I'll note that as a medium risk due to age-related factors in recidivism studies.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. Arrest history without conviction can be tricky; sometimes it indicates a lack of prior opportunities for conviction, but an arrest itself is still a red flag. I'll assign this a medium weight because while convictions are more directly linked to recidivism, arrests do matter.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 185 lbs. Physical size might influence risk in some contexts, but without specific data linking it to criminal behavior, I'll consider this low impact unless there's evidence of gang involvement or similar factors, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risk because of less family support, but living alone might mean he has more autonomy but potentially less supervision. This could be a medium factor, as social supports play a role in recidivism.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and can lead to cycles of poverty and crime. This should be a high weight.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs during the year. Employment generally reduces recidivism, so having held two jobs suggests some stability. However, the number might not be significant enough; I'll assign this a low impact because it's positive but perhaps not substantial.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, especially with drugs linked to criminal behavior like selling or possession. This should be high.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this might be low unless there are other mental health factors, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and family dynamics might influence behavior. This is medium because it touches on socioeconomic factors but isn't directly about prior offenses.\n\nSpirituality: Believes God has something to do with his personal events. Spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism, so this could be low since it's a positive influence.\n\nPutting all these together, the strongest factors are education and drug use (both high). The arrest history, age, and living situation are medium. Positive aspects like employment might counterbalance some risks but aren't enough on their own.\n\nConsidering these weights, I would predict that he is likely to rearrest within three years, so \"YES.\" My confidence isn't extremely high because there are positive factors, but the negatives are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college increases risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs shows some stability but limited impact\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use in past four years is a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently, reducing this factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family dynamics influence risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer some protective effect\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
