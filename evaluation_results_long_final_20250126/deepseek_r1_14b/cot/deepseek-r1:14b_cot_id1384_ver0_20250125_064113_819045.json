    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this individual re-arresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. I know that younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. But I'm not sure if 19 is particularly high or just medium.\n\nShe identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I recall there's a higher risk in certain ethnic groups, possibly due to systemic issues. So maybe that's a high factor.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for recidivism, but without convictions, it might not show a strong criminal history. Maybe medium here.\n\nMarried and living with spouse. Stable relationships usually lower risk. This should be low or negative impact, so probably low.\n\nNo diploma or GED, not in college. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism because of fewer opportunities. That's likely high.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can reduce risk, but only holding one might not be enough\u2014maybe medium?\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years. Recent drug use is a strong indicator, so probably high.\n\nFeels down sometimes recently. Depression or mood issues can increase recidivism risk, so that's medium.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of three, rural area. Family environment might influence behavior; not sure if this is significant enough for low or medium. Maybe low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personally. Religious beliefs can be protective, but I'm not certain how strong the effect is\u2014probably low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age 19, ethnic background, education level, drug use; mediums are arrest history and mental health; lows include marital status, employment, family background, and religion. Considering these, recidivism risk might be on the higher side but not extremely so. Confidence is around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Youth often correlates with higher recidivism rates as individuals may still be in developmental stages and less settled.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity_AmericanIndianEskimoAleut\", \"high\", \"Certain ethnic groups may face systemic issues contributing to higher risks\"),\n    (\"no_convictions_arrests_2\", \"medium\", \"Arrests without convictions suggest potential but lack of criminal record\"),\n    (\"married_living_with_spouse\", \"low\", \"Marriage and stable living situation can be protective factors\"),\n    (\"no_highschool_or ged_not_enrolled_college\", \"high\", \"Lower education is linked to higher recidivism due to limited opportunities\"),\n    (\"held_one_job_past_year\", \"medium\", \"Employment stability might indicate lower risk but only one job could be variable\"),\n    (\"used_drugs MarijuanaCocaine_past_4years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"feel_down_in dumps_past_month\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"lived_with_biological_mother_household_size_3_rural\", \"low\", \"Family environment may have some influence but not significant enough for high\"),\n    (\"god_significant_personally\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs might offer some protection but effect is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
