    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male. Age is relatively young but not too young\u2014some studies suggest higher recidivism rates in younger offenders, so that could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant because they indicate past behavior, so I\u2019d consider this a high risk factor since convictions often correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nHis weight is 200-224 lbs., which might not directly impact recidivism unless it's related to health issues or social stigma, but I'd rate this as low because there\u2019s no direct link here.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t married and lives alone. Lack of strong social support can be a risk factor, so medium makes sense here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism, so that's a high risk.\n\nNo job in the past year\u2014unemployment is a strong indicator for recidivism, so definitely high.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. While drug use can be a factor, unless it's part of ongoing addiction or recent activity, I'd rate this as low compared to other factors.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is positive but not directly related, so low.\n\nLived in a large household (11 people) when young\u2014this might indicate challenges with family dynamics, possibly high risk if there were issues.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. While spirituality can be protective, it's context-dependent and less impactful, so low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are prior arrests/conviction, unemployment, lack of education, living alone, and past drug use. These collectively suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism. I\u2019d predict YES with moderate confidence, say 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not extremely low; some studies show higher recidivism rates among younger offenders\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor, it's not the primary determinant here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction are strong indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight alone is not directly correlated with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate lower social support, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No job in the past year is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use, while not insignificant, may have less impact than more severe drug dependence\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is neutral\"),\n    (\"family_history_household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household as a child could indicate challenges but is not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"spirituality_religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide some stability, though it's context-dependent\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
