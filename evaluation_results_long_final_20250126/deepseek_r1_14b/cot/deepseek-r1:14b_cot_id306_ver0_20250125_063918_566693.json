    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's young, 19, which is a factor because younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates. That might be a medium or high weight. \n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race affects risk factors here; it's more about socioeconomic and other factors, so maybe low impact.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can still be significant, especially without a conviction, which could mean she didn't have the opportunity for rehabilitation through a formal court process. That might be medium because while an arrest is noted, without a conviction, there's less record to influence behavior.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could increase risk slightly, but she's still young, so maybe medium for that factor.\n\nEnrolled in school now, which is positive and can reduce recidivism. So that should be a high positive factor because education is protective against crime.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism, so that's another high positive factor.\n\nUsed drugs recently (marijuana and cocaine). Substance use is a strong predictor of future offenses, especially if she continues using. That would be high as a risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but her absence of current symptoms might lower this factor, so low.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of five when young. Family stability is protective, so that's high positive. \n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her personal events. This might relate to lack of strong social or religious support, which could be a medium risk factor because such support systems often help deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Her age and drug use are significant risks, while education and employment are strong protective factors. The other factors have mixed impacts but overall, the positive aspects might outweigh some negatives. I'm leaning towards low recidivism likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age is a significant factor in predicting higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"white_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone typically has a low impact on recidivism unless associated with other factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction may indicate potential for future issues but is less severe than a conviction\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age might suggest limited support networks, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"enrolled_in_school\", \"high\", \"Current enrollment in school is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"held_one_job_past_year\", \"high\", \"Employment is associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_depression_past_month\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a low risk factor\"),\n    (\"grew_up_with_both_parents_in_large_household\", \"high\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable household is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"spirituality_views\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has no personal influence might suggest lower levels of social or religious support, which could be a risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
