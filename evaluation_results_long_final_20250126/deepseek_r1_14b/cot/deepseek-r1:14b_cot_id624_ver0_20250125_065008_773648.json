    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this individual re-arresting within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. That's young, but in terms of recidivism, being in your late teens or early twenties can be a high-risk period because individuals are still developing impulse control and might be more involved in risky behaviors.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. I know that some studies have shown certain ethnic groups may have higher arrest rates, possibly due to systemic issues rather than actual criminality. But without specific data linking Hispanic males to higher recidivism rates, I'd consider this a medium factor.\n\nSix arrests but no convictions. That's interesting. It could mean he's been stopped for minor offenses or there were dismissals, which might indicate he's more involved in low-level crimes but hasn't faced serious charges yet. This is a high risk because multiple arrests without convictions can still signal ongoing problematic behavior.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so that probably doesn't impact recidivism directly. I'll skip this one.\n\nNever married, living alone. Being unmarried might mean fewer social ties, which could be a risk factor. Living alone might reduce support systems, increasing the likelihood of getting into trouble again. So medium here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and increases involvement in criminal activities. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment, especially chronic, correlates with higher crime rates as individuals turn to illegal means for income. High risk here too.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. While pot is less severe than other drugs, any drug use can be a red flag, possibly indicating substance abuse issues that might lead to criminal behavior again. Medium risk.\n\nNo depression reported recently. Mental health is important; if he's not depressed now, it might reduce some risk, but without knowing his full mental history, I'm not sure. Maybe low impact here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a household of 10 in a rural area. Large families and rural settings can sometimes have higher crime rates due to socio-economic factors, but this is probably a medium factor because it's more about context than direct influence.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. This might indicate lower spiritual support, which could affect behavior. I'd rate this as low impact since it's not a direct risk factor like others.\n\nPutting it all together: several high and medium factors suggest a higher chance of recidivism. The confidence level is around 70% because while there are significant risks, some factors like mental health and spirituality might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old is in a high-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may correlate with higher arrest rates, though not directly indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Six arrests without convictions suggest ongoing problematic behavior and potential future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits employment opportunities and increases risk of criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Chronic unemployment correlates with higher crime rates as individuals may turn to illegal activities for income.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use indicates potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Coming from a large rural household may indicate socio-economic challenges contributing to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's role in personal life may reduce social support systems, though not a direct risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
