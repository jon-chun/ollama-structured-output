    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low weight because it's on the younger side but not too young. Race being Black might have some statistical significance in some contexts, so I'll give that a high weight. He's been arrested once and convicted once; that's a medium risk factor as past convictions are significant.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem to correlate with recidivism much, so low there. Marital status and living alone\u2014being single and alone could be a risk, but not extremely high, so medium. Education level is low, which is a high risk because education is linked to employment and stability. Unemployed? Wait, he has held two jobs during the year, so that's actually a positive sign, indicating some responsibility, so maybe low weight.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana, is a medium factor since drug use can be related to criminal behavior. The recent depressed mood is high because mental health issues are strong indicators of potential recidivism. Family background with living in an urban area and household size might not be too significant, so low weight. Lastly, his spirituality\u2014religion can sometimes be protective, but it's a bit situational, so medium.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: he has a few high-risk factors like education level and recent depression, which are strong indicators. However, he also has some positive aspects like holding jobs. But the negative factors might outweigh the positives. So I think the prediction would be YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is relatively young, which may indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history suggests potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may indicate fewer social supports reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED and not enrolled in college suggests lower educational attainment linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates some stability, but not a strong indicator alone\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use over the past four years may correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Recent depressed mood is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background_urban_living\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing and family structure do not strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs may have protective effects but are context-dependent\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
