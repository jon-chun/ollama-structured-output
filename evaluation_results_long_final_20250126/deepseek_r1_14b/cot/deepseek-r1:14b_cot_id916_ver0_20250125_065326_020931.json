    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. That\u2019s a key factor because younger adults are generally more likely to reoffend compared to older individuals who might have settled into stable lives.\n\nHe has a prior arrest but no conviction. Arrests without convictions can be tricky. Sometimes they indicate that charges were dropped or not proven, which might suggest lower risk, but the mere fact of being arrested could still signal potential for future issues.\n\nRace is White. I'm aware that race can sometimes correlate with statistical recidivism rates, though it's a sensitive area and should be considered alongside other factors to avoid bias.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 160 lbs. Physical stature doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so this might not carry much weight on its own.\n\nMarital status: never married and not living alone. Being single isn't a direct indicator, but living with others could mean more supervision or support, potentially lowering risk, but it's not definitive.\n\nEducation level: completed an associate degree but not enrolled now. Educational attainment can be protective against recidivism. Having some college education might indicate better employability and life skills, which are positive factors.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs in the past year. Steady employment is generally a good sign. Employment can provide structure and income, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. The presence of drug use could indicate ongoing issues that might lead to further legal trouble.\n\nMental health: hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so the absence of depression here is positive, but substance use still remains a concern.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological parents in a household of four. Family stability can be protective, suggesting he had a supportive upbringing, which might reduce future risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn\u2019t see God\u2019s involvement in his life. Low religiosity can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but it's not the strongest factor on its own.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Age 21: High (young adults are more volatile)\n- Prior arrest: Medium (arrest history without conviction is moderate risk)\n- Education: High (positive influence)\n- Employment: High (steady jobs are protective)\n- Drug use: High (substance abuse is a major factor)\n- Family background: Medium (stable family can help, but not the strongest)\n- Religious beliefs: Low (less impact compared to others)\n\nConsidering all factors, despite positive influences like education and employment, the high drug use and prior arrest could indicate potential for rearrest. Therefore, I would predict \"YES\" with moderate confidence, say 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"high\", \"21 years old is a key age where individuals are still developing but also more likely to engage in risky behavior compared to older adults.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction can indicate potential for future issues, though it's less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race is considered here but should be analyzed alongside other factors to avoid biased conclusions.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior on their own.\"),\n    (\"never_married_not_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living with others might provide support, reducing risk, though being unmarried isn't a direct indicator\"),\n    (\"education_associate\", \"high\", \"Having completed an associate degree suggests better employability and life skills, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"employment_two_jobs\", \"high\", \"Steady employment is a strong positive indicator of lower recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana_cocaine\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health_not_depressed\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces some risk, but drug use remains concerning\"),\n    (\"family_background_parents\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable household can be protective\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_none\", \"low\", \"Low religiosity is considered here, though it's not the strongest factor compared to others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
