    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk assessment for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Asian/Pacific Islander. From what I know, there might be some stereotypes or data suggesting lower recidivism rates in certain groups, but it's not a hard and fast rule. So maybe that's a low risk here.\n\nHe was arrested once but never convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, but without a conviction, it's less severe. I'd say this is medium because an arrest still indicates some potential for future issues, but the lack of conviction might mean he didn't actually commit a serious crime.\n\nAge 22 is young, so maybe still developing and could change his behavior. That sounds low risk in terms of age being a mitigating factor.\n\nHeight and weight\u20146'1\" and 160 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly correlate with criminal behavior unless they're involved in certain crimes, which isn't indicated here. So probably low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being single might mean less family support but also fewer responsibilities. Living alone could be neutral; maybe it's a low factor since there's no indication of unstable living conditions affecting his behavior.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so that should be a medium or high positive factor. But he hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if it leads to financial strain or idleness. So this might be medium because while education is good, joblessness could pose some issues.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. Drug use can increase recidivism, but marijuana is less severe than other drugs. Still, any drug use is a risk factor, so probably medium here.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is crucial; absence of depression is positive, so that's low risk.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates. So this could balance out as a low factor because while family support is good, environment could still influence him negatively.\n\nHe considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is often linked to lower recidivism, so that should be a high positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: several factors are low or medium, with only a few high positives (education and religion). The arrest might weigh heavier because it's more concrete than the other factors. Considering all these, I'm not sure if he'll reoffend. Maybe the positives balance out the negatives, so my prediction is NO, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_22\", \"low\", \"Youth can be a mitigating factor as individuals may still be developing and maturing\"),\n    (\"ethnicity asian pacific islander\", \"low\", \"Generally, this demographic has shown lower recidivism rates in some studies, though not universally applicable\"),\n    (\"single_unmarried_living_alone\", \"low\", \"No immediate family ties but also no negative indicators from living alone\"),\n    (\"never_convicted\", \"medium\", \"Lack of conviction despite an arrest may indicate low criminal propensity\"),\n    (\"education_college_enrolled_highschool_diploma\", \"high\", \"Education is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana_past_4_years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can be a risk factor, but marijuana typically carries lower risk than other substances\"),\n    (\"never_married\", \"low\", \"No indication of relationship instability affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior unless in specific contexts\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_with_parents\", \"low\", \"Family stability may be protective, though urban areas can have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_god_role\", \"high\", \"Religious involvement is generally associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"unemployed_year\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can indicate stressors that may contribute to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
