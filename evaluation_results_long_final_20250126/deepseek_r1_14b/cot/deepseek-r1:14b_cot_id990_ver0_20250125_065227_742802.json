    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female reoffending in the next three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. That's a young adult, right? Younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and maybe not as settled. So that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure how race plays into this, but sometimes there can be systemic issues or stereotypes affecting outcomes. But in some cases, being part of the majority might mean less scrutiny. Hmm, maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested once without conviction. That's interesting because an arrest can still affect her, like with a criminal record even if not convicted. It might make it harder to get jobs or housing, which could push someone towards crime again. So that should be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'7\" and 175-199 lbs. I don't know how physical stats relate directly to recidivism. Maybe if she's bigger, she might be seen as more intimidating? Not sure; maybe low impact.\n\nNever married, living alone. Being single isn't a bad sign necessarily. But living alone could mean less support from family, which is a risk factor for relapse. So medium here.\n\nEnrolled in school and held two jobs. Education and employment are usually protective factors against recidivism because they provide structure and opportunities. That should be high positive, so low risk impact.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of future offenses, especially if she's not getting treatment or support. So that's high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not currently depressed, this might be low impact.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 4. Family environment is important; maybe it was stable, but without more info, I'm leaning towards medium for family dynamics.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her life. Spirituality can sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism, so lack thereof might be low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are arrest record, drug use, school/jobs; medium are age, living alone, family background; low include race, physical stats, spirituality.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_18\", \"medium\", \"18 is a young adult age, which can be associated with higher recidivism rates due to ongoing developmental stages\"),\n    (\"white_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity may have some influence but not as significant in this case\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"high\", \"An arrest without conviction can still impact future opportunities and may indicate potential for further issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"enrolled_school_two_jobs\", \"low\", \"Positive indicators of stability and structure in life\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"no_depression_recently\", \"low\", \"No current depression reduces risk, but past mental health issues could be unknown\"),\n    (\"family_background_small_household\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a small household may indicate some stability or instability depending on context\"),\n    (\"spirituality_lack_of_religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence might not directly impact recidivism without more context\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
