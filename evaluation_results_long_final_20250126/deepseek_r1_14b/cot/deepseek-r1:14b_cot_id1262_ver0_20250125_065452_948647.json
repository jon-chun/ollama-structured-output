    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. I know that younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet and could be more impulsive. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. I'm not sure how significant this is on its own. It might play a role in societal factors but without more context, maybe it's low impact.\n\nHe has been arrested once but never convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, especially if he didn't go to trial or was acquitted. That's probably medium risk here.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant on their own. So they're low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support, so that could be a slight risk but not major. Maybe medium for living alone, but I'm not certain.\n\nHigh school diploma is good; education can be protective against recidivism. That's a low risk factor because it's positive.\n\nNot enrolled in college: Not necessarily bad unless he has no plans. Since he's working, maybe it's neutral, so low impact.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. Both are positive indicators, so low risk here as they reduce likelihood of recidivism.\n\nLived with biological dad in a household of three in an urban area. Urban areas might have more challenges, but family environment is mixed since he's with his dad. Could be medium if the family dynamics contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe considers God irrelevant personally. Spirituality can sometimes be protective, so lacking it might be low impact on its own.\n\nPutting all together: He has a couple of high and medium factors but more positive ones too. The arrest is notable, but no conviction, which is good. So maybe the prediction leans towards NO recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"high\", \"Young age can be a significant risk factor for recidivism as individuals may still exhibit impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"hispanic_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a primary determinant of recidivism but may intersect with other factors\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"An arrest without conviction indicates potential risk but not definitive evidence of guilt\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"Education can serve as a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"not_enrolled_college\", \"low\", \"Lack of college enrollment is not inherently risky but could be considered in context\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_last_four_years\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"urban_living_with_biological_dad\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and living with biological father may present challenges affecting risk\"),\n    (\"spirituality_irrelevant\", \"low\", \"Lack of spiritual engagement might not significantly impact recidivism on its own\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
