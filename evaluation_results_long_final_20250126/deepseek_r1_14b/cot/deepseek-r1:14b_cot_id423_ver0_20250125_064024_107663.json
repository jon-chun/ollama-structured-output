    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the age is 22. That's young, but not too young. I know that younger offenders are often at higher risk because they might be less settled in their lives. But 22 is a bit older than some other groups, so maybe the risk isn't as high as someone just out of jail.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can be a factor, but it's more about socioeconomic factors and systemic issues rather than the race itself. I don't think this should carry much weight on its own unless there are underlying issues tied to race, which aren't specified here.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. That's a couple of run-ins with the law. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, but the fact that he was convicted shows he has been through the system before. Maybe this is a medium factor because it's not an extremely high number but still significant.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'5\" and 155 lbs. Physical size might affect opportunities or interactions, but I'm not sure how relevant this is to recidivism. Unless there's something about his physical presence affecting others, I'd say low impact here.\n\nNever married, living alone. Marital status can be a factor; being single might mean fewer social ties. Living alone could mean less support system, which is a risk factor. So maybe medium because lack of support can influence behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big one. Lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism rates because there are fewer opportunities. This should be high because education is a strong indicator of future stability.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment history can be a mitigating factor, but having only held two jobs might indicate inconsistency or that he's not fully integrated into the workforce. So maybe medium here, as it's some employment but not stable enough.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance use is a major risk factor for recidivism. Both marijuana and cocaine can impair judgment and lead to further criminal activity. This should be high because drug use directly relates to higher rearrest rates.\n\nReported feeling down in the dumps some days, nothing cheered him up. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism by affecting behavior and decision-making. Depression or other mood disorders might make it harder to stay out of trouble. So medium here as a factor.\n\nLived with biological father in a household of size 4. Family background can influence behavior. Growing up in a larger family, especially if there were issues, could contribute to risk factors. But without more info on the family dynamics, I'd rate this low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective or not, depending on how it's used. If it's a positive influence, it might reduce recidivism; if it leads to criminal behavior (like justifying actions), it could increase risk. Not sure, so I'll say low.\n\nPutting this all together: the high factors are education level and drug use. Medium factors include arrest/conviction history, living alone, employment status, mental health, and age. Low factors are race, physical stats, family background, and religious beliefs.\n\nThe strongest indicators for recidivism here seem to be lack of education and substance abuse. Those two high factors might push the prediction towards YES for rearrest. The confidence is around 70% because while there are significant risk factors, some like age and employment might mitigate it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_22\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may be at higher risk for recidivism but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race alone is generally not a strong predictor of recidivism unless coupled with socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate past criminal behavior, moderately increasing risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size does not strongly correlate with recidivism risk in this context\"),\n    (\"marital_status_unmarried_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, contributing to a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and lack of college enrollment is a strong predictor of higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs shows some stability but not significant enough to mitigate risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4_years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) significantly increases recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible mental health issues, moderately increasing risk\"),\n    (\"family_background_lived_with_father\", \"low\", \"Living with father in a household of four may have some influence but not strongly predictive\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_role_of_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role can be protective or potentially destabilizing depending on context\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
