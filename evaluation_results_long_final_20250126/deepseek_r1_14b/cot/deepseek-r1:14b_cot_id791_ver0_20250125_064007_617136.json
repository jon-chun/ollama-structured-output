    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to break this down. So, I'm supposed to assess the risk of recidivism for a 21-year-old female over the next three years based on various factors provided. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best to think through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given information:\n\n- **Age**: 21 years old\n- **Gender**: Female\n- **Race**: White\n- **Previous Arrests and Convictions**: Arrested twice, convicted once\n- **Height/Weight**: 5'2\", 120 lbs. (Not sure if this matters directly)\n- **Marital Status**: Married, living with spouse\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED; not enrolled in college\n- **Employment**: Unemployed for the past year\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years\n- **Mental Health**: Not felt depressed in the past month\n- **Family Background**: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 5, rural area\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Considers God's role in her personal events\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor one by one to assess their weight (low, medium, high) and the reasoning behind it.\n\n1. **Age (21)**: Typically, younger offenders are at a higher risk of recidivism because they might have less stable lives and more impulsive behavior. However, 21 isn't extremely young, but still on the lower end. So maybe Medium?\n\nWait, but some studies show that peak ages for crime are in the late teens to early twenties, so being 21 could be a slight risk factor.\n\n2. **Gender (Female)**: Generally, female recidivism rates are lower than males. So this might be a Low risk factor.\n\n3. **Race (White)**: Race can be a factor, but it's complex. Some studies show disparities, but being White might indicate lower systemic risks. However, I'm not sure if that directly affects individual risk. Maybe Medium? Or perhaps no significant impact here.\n\nWait, maybe race is more about societal factors than individual risk, so perhaps Low or Neutral. But since the question asks to assign weights, and race could be a factor in broader contexts, maybe Medium?\n\nHmm, I'm not too confident on this one.\n\n4. **Previous Arrests and Convictions (2 arrests, 1 conviction)**: Having prior convictions is a strong indicator of future recidivism. So this should definitely be High.\n\n5. **Employment Status (Unemployed for the past year)**: Unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to financial strain and more time to engage in criminal activities. This seems like a Medium or High factor.\n\nGiven that she's been unemployed for a year, which is significant, I'd say High.\n\n6. **Education (No diploma/GED, not enrolled)**: Lack of education correlates with higher recidivism because limited job prospects can lead to crime. So this should be Medium.\n\n7. **Drug Use (Marijuana in past four years)**: Marijuana use can indicate potential substance abuse issues, which are linked to criminal behavior. But since it's only marijuana and not more severe drugs, maybe Medium.\n\n8. **Marital Status (Married, living with spouse)**: Being married is often a protective factor against recidivism because of the added responsibilities and support system. So this should be Low.\n\n9. **Family Background (Lived with both parents in rural area)**: Growing up in a stable family environment can have mixed effects. Rural areas might have different opportunities, but if the household was of size 5, maybe indicating some challenges? Not sure. This could be Low or Medium. Maybe Medium since it's not entirely negative.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs (Believes God has a role)**: Religious involvement can sometimes act as a deterrent to crime, so this should be a protective factor. So Low.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Age: High\n- Gender: Low\n- Race: Medium? Or maybe not significant enough for a weight. Maybe Medium.\n- Previous Arrests/Convictions: High\n- Employment: High\n- Education: Medium\n- Drug Use: Medium\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Family Background: Medium\n- Religious Beliefs: Low\n\nWait, but I'm overcomplicating it because not all factors should be given the same weight. Let me prioritize:\n\n1. Previous Arrests/Convictions: High (most impactful)\n2. Employment: High\n3. Age: Medium\n4. Education: Medium\n5. Drug Use: Medium\n6. Family Background: Medium\n7. Gender: Low\n8. Marital Status: Low\n9. Religious Beliefs: Low\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact weightings. Let me try again.\n\n- **Previous Arrests/Convictions**: High (strong predictor)\n- **Employment Status**: High (unemployed for a year is significant)\n- **Age**: Medium (21 is still young but past peak maybe)\n- **Education**: Medium (no diploma and not enrolled)\n- **Drug Use**: Medium (marijuana use)\n- **Family Background**: Maybe Low or Medium? Not sure.\n- **Marital Status**: Protective, so Low\n- **Gender/Race/Religion**: Lower impact\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Previous Arrests: High\n- Employment: High\n- Age: Medium\n- Education: Medium\n- Drug Use: Medium\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Family Background: Maybe Medium if rural is a factor, but I'm not certain.\n- Gender/Race/Religion: Low\n\nI think I might have overcomplicated this. Let me try to structure it as per the JSON format they provided.\n\nSo, the factors would be:\n\n1. Previous arrests and convictions - High\n2. Employment status - High (unemployed for a year)\n3. Education level - Medium (no diploma and not in school)\n4. Age - Medium (21 is still young but might have some stability)\n5. Drug use - Medium (past marijuana use)\n6. Marital status - Low (married, which is protective)\n7. Family background - Maybe Low or Medium? Since she grew up with both parents, perhaps it's a bit more stable, so maybe Medium.\n8. Gender - Low\n9. Race - Not sure, but perhaps Medium if considering systemic factors, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps race isn't directly a risk factor here. It might be better to exclude or assign Low since it's White and we're looking for recidivism risk. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't significantly impact, so Low.\n\nSimilarly, religious beliefs - Low.\n\nSo the JSON would include all these factors with their respective weights and reasoning.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is a typical age for potential recidivism but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"gender_female\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race may influence systemic factors but isn't directly indicative of individual risk\"),\n    (\"previous_arrests_convictions_2_1\", \"high\", \"Conviction history is a strong predictor of future offenses\"),\n    (\"unemployed_past_year\", \"high\", \"Long-term unemployment correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_highschool_ged\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase risk\"),\n    (\"marijuana_use_past4years\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is linked to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"married_living_with_spouse\", \"low\", \"Marital status is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background_rural_parents\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a stable family, but rural factors may influence risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs_god_role\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can deter criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
