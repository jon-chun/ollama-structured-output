    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male. Age is important because younger offenders are often at higher risk due to factors like immaturity and lack of stable life experiences. But being 20 isn't extremely young; some might argue it's still on the lower end but not as high as someone in their late teens.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can be a factor, but I should consider if there are any specific data points or studies linking race to recidivism rates. However, I don't have explicit info here beyond his identification, so maybe it's more about other factors influencing him.\n\nArrested once without conviction. A prior arrest is significant because even if not convicted, it can indicate potential for future issues. But the lack of a conviction might suggest he didn't actually commit a crime or that the case was dismissed, which could be a positive sign.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 190 lbs. Physical size isn't directly linked to criminal behavior, so I don't think this is a major factor here. Unless it's related to some other variable like employment or social interactions, but nothing stands out.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might be a risk because he doesn't have the support of a spouse or family. But being single isn't inherently bad; it just means he relies more on other social networks. Without marriage ties, there's less immediate consequence for his actions in terms of family obligations.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. College enrollment suggests he's trying to better himself, which is a positive factor that could reduce his risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is another strong protective factor. Having a steady job can provide income stability and structure, reducing the incentive to commit crimes. However, holding only one job in a year might not indicate long-term stability, but it's still better than being unemployed.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Both marijuana and cocaine are substances that can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior. The recent use suggests ongoing issues, which could increase his likelihood of rearrest.\n\nNot felt depressed in the past month. Mental health is crucial. Not feeling depressed recently might indicate he's not struggling with this particular issue right now, but without more info on other mental health aspects or history, it's hard to assess fully.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective. However, urban areas may have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences. The size of the household (four people) could mean more supervision but might also indicate a larger social network that could either support or enable criminal behavior.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious involvement is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, as it can provide moral guidance and support. However, without knowing the extent of his religious involvement beyond this belief, it's hard to gauge its impact.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Age 20: Medium. Not extremely high risk but still a factor.\n- Prior arrest: High. Even without conviction, it indicates potential for future issues.\n- Education/employment: High positive factors, so low risk here.\n- Drug use: High negative factor, increasing risk.\n- Living alone and never married: Medium risk as he lacks some support structures.\n- Belief in God: Low impact unless more involved.\n\nBalancing these, the high-risk factors (drug use, prior arrest) might outweigh the protective ones. His age is a moderate risk, but his positive aspects like education and employment are strong. However, drug use is a significant concern that could lead to recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest with about 60% confidence because while he has several protective factors, the recent drug use and prior arrest are substantial risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"Youth can be a risk factor due to immaturity, but being 20 is not extremely high\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_no_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior arrest suggests potential for future issues despite no conviction\"),\n    (\"education_enrolled_college\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college indicates positive intent and stability\"),\n    (\"employed_recently\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides structure and income, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana_cocaine\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone_never_married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spousal support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer moral guidance but impact is unclear without more info\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
