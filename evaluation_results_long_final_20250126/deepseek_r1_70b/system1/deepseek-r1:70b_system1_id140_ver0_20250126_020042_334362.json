    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender are known risk factors\u2014young males often have higher crime rates. However, race alone isn't a direct indicator but might correlate with other social factors.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. A high number of arrests and a conviction suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism. This is a significant red flag.\n\nPhysical characteristics like height and weight (5'7\", 154 lbs) don't directly relate to risk assessment unless considering possible physical confrontations, but they're less relevant compared to other factors.\n\nHis marital status is single, living alone. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with instability or lack of social support, which might increase risk. Living alone could indicate limited supervision or support systems.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment and recidivism. It often limits job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity as an alternative means of income.\n\nEmployment history shows he's had two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate poor life stability or difficulties in maintaining work, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use is present\u2014he used marijuana in the past four years and some in the last month. Drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk, though marijuana's impact varies compared to harder drugs.\n\nHe sometimes felt down emotionally, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase recidivism if they lead to substance abuse or poor decision-making.\n\nHis upbringing was in an urban area with a household of five, living with his biological mother. Urban environments might have higher crime exposure, but family structure here seems stable (living with biological parent), which is a protective factor against high risk.\n\nHe believes God influences personal events, suggesting some religious affiliation. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and social support.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: The multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. Lack of education and unstable employment exacerbate this. Drug use and mental health issues add to the risk. However, his religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. Considering all factors, the overall assessment leans towards high risk but with moderate confidence because while several factors point to higher risk, there are also mitigating elements like religious belief that could reduce it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 154 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
