    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The individual is 21 years old. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk as they might still be developing impulse control and may have less life stability.\n\nGender and race: He identifies as White male. While demographics alone aren't determinative, some studies suggest that certain groups might have higher rates of recidivism, though this is more about systemic factors than individual risk.\n\nArrests and convictions: Four arrests and at least one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. Each prior arrest increases the likelihood of future offenses as it suggests both opportunity and inclination towards illegal activities.\n\nPhysical build: 5'10\" and 215 lbs could be seen as above average weight, possibly indicating strength, which might be relevant in certain types of crimes, but not directly a risk factor on its own.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Single individuals, especially younger ones, may have less stable home environments or fewer social ties that can deter criminal behavior.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision and potentially more opportunity to engage in risky behaviors without immediate accountability.\n\nEducation and employment: He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which is positive as education usually reduces recidivism risk. However, he hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nSubstance use: He used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the last month. Drug use is a known risk factor as it can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, though marijuana's impact might be less severe than other drugs.\n\nMental health: Felt down for parts of the past month. While this indicates potential mental health issues, without more severity details (like diagnosis or treatment), it's a moderate concern. Mental health problems can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\n\nFamily background: Lived in a household of size 6 when young. Larger households might indicate less individual attention, possible neglect, or instability, which are risk factors for delinquency.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lower religious involvement is sometimes linked to higher recidivism, as religion can provide social support and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of multiple arrests, unemployment, substance use, mental health issues, living alone, and lower religious involvement leans towards a higher risk profile. However, his enrollment in college is a positive factor that might mitigate some risks.\n\nConfidence in this assessment would be around 85%, considering the mix of strong and moderate risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 215 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 6. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
