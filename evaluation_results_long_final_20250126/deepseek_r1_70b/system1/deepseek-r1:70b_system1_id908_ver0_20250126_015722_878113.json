    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person's risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I don't think that's directly a risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could indicate some involvement with the law, but since he wasn't convicted, it's unclear how serious the offense was or if it will repeat. This might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal risk. Unless there's something specific about his physical build that's linked to crime, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support or supervision, but it's also common for young adults. Not being married at 18 isn't unusual either. Maybe a slight risk if living alone leads to isolation, but not a major factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior. Having a diploma is positive, so this might lower his risk rather than increase it.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having a job suggests some responsibility and integration into society, which would typically reduce risk. Only having one job in a year isn't too concerning unless there were issues with employment stability, but that's not specified here.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be linked to higher criminal involvement, either through drug-related crimes or impaired judgment leading to other offenses. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so the risk might be moderate rather than high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes increase risk factors if left untreated. Not feeling depressed suggests better emotional stability.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size four when he was young. Stable family environments are generally protective against criminal behavior. A larger household might mean more support or more stress, but without more info, it's probably neutral or slightly positive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: the arrest without conviction is a concern, as is the drug use. However, he has several protective factors like education, employment, stable family background, and religious beliefs. His age might make him more impulsive, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nSo, I don't think these factors add up to a high risk overall. The confidence level would be moderate because while there are some concerning points, the positive factors likely mitigate them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
