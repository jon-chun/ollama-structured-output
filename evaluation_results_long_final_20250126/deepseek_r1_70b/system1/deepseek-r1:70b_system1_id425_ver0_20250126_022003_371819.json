    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but race alone isn't typically a direct indicator of risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but it's not a strong predictor on its own since he hasn't been found guilty yet.\n\nHis physical description is 5'8\" and 160 lbs., which doesn't stand out as particularly unusual or indicative of risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't necessarily a red flag; it could just mean independence. Not being married might not be relevant here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a concerning factor because lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some employment history but also possible instability if he's changing jobs frequently. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and while drug use can be a risk factor, especially for more serious drugs, marijuana alone might not be as significant unless it's frequent or part of a pattern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, but the absence here might lower that particular risk.\n\nLiving situation as a child: He lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up with both parents is generally a stabilizing factor, so this might reduce risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with higher risk, but it's not a strong predictor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The main concerns are the lack of education and job instability. However, other factors like living with both parents and no recent mental health issues might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a concern but not definitive. Drug use is present but limited to marijuana.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" for high risk but with lower confidence around 40%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
