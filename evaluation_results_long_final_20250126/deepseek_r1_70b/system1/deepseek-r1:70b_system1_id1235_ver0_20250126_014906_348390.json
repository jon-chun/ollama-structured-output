    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors; young males are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, race alone isn't a direct indicator of risk\u2014it\u2019s more about systemic issues rather than individual behavior.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate guilt. But having an arrest on record could still be a point to consider, as even an arrest can sometimes correlate with higher risk, depending on circumstances.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 170 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't think that's a significant factor one way or the other. Physical size might matter in specific contexts, like violent crimes, but without more info, it\u2019s neutral here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor; single people living alone might have less social support, which could be a risk factor. But it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important\u2014higher education often correlates with lower recidivism because it provides more opportunities and stability. Not having gone to college might be a slight risk factor.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a protective factor as it provides structure, income, and social integration. Having had two jobs could indicate some instability or perhaps just job hopping, which is common in early careers. It's not a strong negative unless there were issues at work.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana is widely used and generally considered less harmful than other drugs. Occasional use might not be a major risk factor unless it\u2019s frequent or leading to impairment. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a positive sign regarding mental health, which can influence behavior.\n\nHe grew up living with his biological mother in an urban area with seven people. Large family size could mean less individual attention, but urban environments might have higher crime rates and exposure to risky behaviors. However, living with a biological parent is usually a stabilizing factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a direct indicator of risk. It really depends on other factors.\n\nPutting this all together: young age and male gender are minor risks; an arrest without conviction is something to note but not definitive. Employment history is neutral or slightly positive. Drug use is mild. Family background has both stabilizing (living with mother) and potential challenges (urban, large household). No recent mental health issues.\n\nI don't see strong indicators of high risk here. Most factors are either neutral or low risk. So my prediction would be NO, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors like the arrest and living situation could vary.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
