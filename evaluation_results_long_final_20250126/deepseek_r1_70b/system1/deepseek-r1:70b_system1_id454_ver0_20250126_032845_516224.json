    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age and gender might not be significant risk factors on their own. Younger individuals can sometimes have higher crime rates, but that's too broad to make a determination here.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's something to note because prior arrests and convictions are usually indicators of potential recidivism. However, two arrests aren't extremely high, so I need to see other factors.\n\nHer physical description is 5'5\" and 130 lbs. Not really relevant for risk assessment unless considering escape risks or violence, but without more context, it's not a major factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less stability or support system, which might be a slight risk, but being unmarried at 22 is pretty common these days.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is typically a positive factor. Being in college suggests she's actively engaged in improving herself, which usually lowers recidivism risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having a job is generally a good sign. However, only holding one job might indicate some instability, but it's not too concerning.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or associated with other crimes. But marijuana alone isn't as severe as harder drugs. It's something to consider but not a major red flag on its own.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, that might lower the risk.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults at a young age in an urban area. Unstable living conditions as a child can be a risk factor for future issues, including criminal behavior. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could contribute to her environment being higher risk.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, but it depends on the context. It's more of a neutral factor here unless tied to extremist behaviors, which isn't indicated.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like prior convictions, drug use, unstable childhood, but also positive factors like education and employment. The presence of any criminal history is concerning, but it's not extensive. Her current stability with education and job might mitigate the risks. I'm leaning towards her being a moderate risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
