    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be indicators, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk. Being female might actually lower some risks compared to males in certain contexts.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things\u2014maybe she was charged but not found guilty, or the charges were dropped. It\u2019s something to consider, but since there are no convictions, it might not weigh as heavily against her.\n\nHer physical description is 5'2\" and 180 lbs. Height isn't really a risk factor, but weight could be related to health issues, which might tie into other behaviors or risks. However, without more context on her lifestyle or health, it's hard to say if this is significant.\n\nShe\u2019s married and living with her spouse. Stability in relationships can sometimes lower risk factors because it indicates a support system. Being married at 20 is also relatively young but not uncommon. It might suggest some level of stability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is positive, but not pursuing higher education could mean she's focusing on work or other aspects of her life. However, without knowing her career goals or current job satisfaction, it's hard to judge the risk here.\n\nShe\u2019s held four jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a red flag because frequent changes might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to reliability or personal problems. However, she's young and might still be figuring out her career path, so this isn't necessarily a high-risk indicator on its own.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana is a common drug, and while it can indicate substance use issues, especially if frequent or in combination with other factors, occasional use might not be as significant. The fact that she hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently is positive; mental health issues can increase risk factors, so this is a good sign.\n\nHer upbringing was stable: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable household can reduce certain risk factors related to family instability or neglect, which are often linked to higher risks in behavior.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and lower risks of negative behaviors, as they might offer guidance and community support.\n\nPutting it all together: the main points that could indicate risk are the two arrests (though no convictions), four jobs in a year suggesting instability, and past drug use. However, she has stable living conditions with her spouse, a high school diploma, no recent mental health issues, and a supportive upbringing. These positive factors likely outweigh the potential risks from the other elements.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, I don't think she's a high risk. The confidence level would be moderate since there are some points to consider but they're not strong enough on their own.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
