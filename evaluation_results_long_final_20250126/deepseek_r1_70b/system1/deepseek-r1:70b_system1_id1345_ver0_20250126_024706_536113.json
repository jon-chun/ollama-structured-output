    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this person presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but being young doesn't inherently mean high risk. Her race doesn't indicate risk either; it's more about the individual circumstances.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest that the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty, which is a positive sign. It shows there's no criminal history beyond the arrest.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145'2\" and 120 lbs\u2014don't relate to risk assessment unless considering escape risk, but that's not usually a factor here. So this isn't a concern.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a minor risk factor if she lacks a strong support system. However, being unmarried at 20 is common and doesn't necessarily indicate anything negative.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can relate to stability, but having a diploma shows she completed her basic education, which is positive. Not being enrolled in college might limit future opportunities, but it's not a direct risk factor unless combined with other issues like unemployment.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. This suggests some instability or perhaps she's exploring different career paths. However, frequent job changes could indicate difficulties maintaining employment, which might relate to higher risk if linked to impulsive behavior or irresponsibility.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a significant factor in recidivism and risk, so her abstinence is a good sign.\n\nShe's felt down at times recently. Feeling down can indicate mental health issues like depression, which could be a risk factor if severe or untreated. However, it's not specified how this affects her behavior or daily functioning.\n\nHer upbringing with her biological dad in an urban area of four people doesn't immediately raise red flags. Growing up in an urban environment might expose her to higher crime areas, but that's speculative without more context.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can be a protective factor as it may provide emotional support and moral guidance, potentially lowering risk behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: the lack of convictions, no drug use, stable education, and religious beliefs are positive. The job changes and mental health concerns are minor points but not enough on their own to indicate high risk. Therefore, overall, she doesn't present as a high-risk individual.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
