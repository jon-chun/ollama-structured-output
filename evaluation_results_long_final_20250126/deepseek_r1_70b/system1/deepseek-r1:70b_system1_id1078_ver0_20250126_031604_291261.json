    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender are known risk factors; young males, especially in certain socioeconomic contexts, can have higher tendencies towards criminal behavior due to various societal pressures and opportunities.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted, which is a significant number for someone so young. A high arrest and conviction history strongly suggests a pattern of criminal behavior that might continue, indicating a higher risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145 feet 11 inches and 180 lbs\u2014are within average ranges and don't particularly stand out as risk factors unless related to specific crimes, but there's no indication here, so this may not be a significant factor.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; being unmarried might indicate less social support or more freedom to engage in risky behavior, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college points to lower educational attainment. Education often provides skills and opportunities that reduce criminal tendencies, so this is a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can lead to financial instability and idleness, which might drive individuals towards illegal activities.\n\nDrug use\u2014specifically marijuana over the past four years\u2014is present. While marijuana is less harmful than some other drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, contributing to higher risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, but mental health issues can sometimes be a factor. However, the absence of depression doesn't necessarily lower the risk; other mental health issues could still be present or past trauma might play a role.\n\nHis upbringing involved living with his biological mother in an urban household of three. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to violence or criminal activity, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social support from religious communities, which might be a protective factor against criminal behavior. However, this varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: high arrest/conviction rate, unemployment, lack of education, living alone, and drug use are strong indicators of higher risk. His age and urban upbringing also contribute. While the absence of depression is positive, other factors outweigh this. Therefore, I lean towards a high-risk assessment with moderate confidence, say 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
