    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual poses a high risk based on the provided factors. Let me break down each factor and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might still be maturing. His height and weight are average, so that doesn't stand out as particularly risky or not.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Recidivism is a concern here\u2014multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could indicate a higher risk. The fact that he's been convicted shows the system has found him guilty before, which might point to ongoing issues.\n\nHis living situation: not married and not living alone. Being single doesn't necessarily correlate with crime, but living with others might mean more stability or less isolation, depending on the environment. It\u2019s a bit neutral here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can affect employment opportunities; limited education might restrict job options, potentially leading to frustration or financial instability. However, he has held one job during the year, which shows some employability and stability. That could be a positive sign, reducing risk factors.\n\nDrug use is present\u2014he's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is common and often less severe than other drugs, any drug use can influence behavior and judgment, possibly increasing risk if it leads to impaired decision-making or legal issues.\n\nNo recent depression reported. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a positive indicator.\n\nHe grew up in a rural area with his biological mother in a household of three. A stable family background could be protective against high-risk behavior, suggesting support and structure during formative years.\n\nHis belief that God influences personal events might provide a sense of purpose or community, which can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The multiple arrests and conviction are red flags for potential recidivism. However, factors like stable family background, current employment, lack of recent mental health issues, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. Drug use is present but not extensive (only marijuana). \n\nI think the risk is present because of his criminal history, but other factors don't overwhelmingly suggest a high risk. So I'd lean towards \"YES\" for prediction but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
