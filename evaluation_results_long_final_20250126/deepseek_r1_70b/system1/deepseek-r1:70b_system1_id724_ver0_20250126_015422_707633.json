    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze whether this person presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Young males might have higher crime rates statistically, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. That's significant because multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of criminal behavior. Recidivism is a concern here; people with more prior offenses are more likely to reoffend.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant unless they indicate something about physicality, but I don't think that's a major factor in risk assessment compared to other elements.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; being unmarried might suggest less social support or stability, which could increase risk factors.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having only a GED and not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending due to limited job prospects.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple short-term jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it's frequent or combined with other substances. However, marijuana alone at a young age might not be as significant as harder drugs, but it still contributes to the overall assessment.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, that might lower the risk compared to someone struggling with mental health issues.\n\nFamily background: lived with his biological dad in a household of size four when young. A stable family environment is usually protective, so this doesn't seem like a high-risk factor unless there were other issues not mentioned here.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher risk factors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. It might relate to lower social bonds or support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. The lack of stable employment (two jobs in a year) and only having a GED could point to instability. Drug use adds to the risk, but it's not as severe if it's only marijuana. Living alone and being unmarried might suggest less support.\n\nI think these factors lean towards indicating a high risk, especially considering the criminal history. However, some elements like stable family background and recent mental health stability might lower the confidence a bit. So, I'd say prediction is YES with a moderate to high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
