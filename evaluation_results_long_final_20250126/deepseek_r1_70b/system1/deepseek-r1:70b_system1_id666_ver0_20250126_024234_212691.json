    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. The user has provided several factors about an individual and wants to know if they indicate a high risk.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old. Youth can sometimes be a factor in higher recidivism rates because younger individuals might not have fully developed decision-making skills. However, being enrolled in school could be a positive sign as it indicates some level of engagement and structure.\n\nHe's male and identifies as White. While demographics alone aren't determinative, they can sometimes correlate with certain trends. I need to consider other factors more closely related to behavior.\n\nHe has two arrests and one conviction. Two prior arrests suggest some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history yet. The fact that he was convicted once might indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to someone with no convictions.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145 feet 9 inches and 140 lbs\u2014are within average range and don't particularly stand out as risk factors one way or the other.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk if he doesn't have a strong support system. On the flip side, it could also mean more independence, so this is a bit neutral.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing skills and structure. However, not having held any jobs in the past year might indicate instability or lack of employment history, which could be a risk factor. Unemployment is often linked with higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use is a significant concern. He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior and recidivism. Even though he hasn't felt depressed recently, ongoing drug use can impede judgment and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child could have mixed implications. A stable family background is generally positive, but growing up in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or peer influences that could increase risk factors.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with his personal life might indicate some level of social or religious support, which can be protective against recidivism by providing a sense of community and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of prior arrests, conviction, drug use, unemployment, and living alone are risk factors. However, being enrolled in school and having a stable family background during childhood might mitigate some risks. The drug use is particularly concerning as it's a strong predictor of recidivism. \n\nSo, while there are both positive and negative factors, the combination of prior criminal involvement and substance abuse leans towards indicating a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
