    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and race alone aren't strong indicators unless combined with other factors. Being young might suggest some impulsivity, but not necessarily a high risk on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean several things\u2014it might not have led to charges, or the case is pending. Without a conviction, it's harder to gauge the severity of the offense, so this factor isn't too concerning yet.\n\nHis physical build is 5 feet 6 inches and 202 lbs. That puts his BMI around 34, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, but in terms of criminal risk, unless related to specific behaviors, it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't unusual, especially these days. Not being married could indicate less stable relationships or social support, which might be a minor risk factor if linked to other issues.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED shows he completed his education, so that's positive. Not attending college doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk unless there are other signs of instability.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Job stability can be a good indicator. Changing jobs might not be a problem if it's for positive reasons, but frequent job changes without a clear pattern could suggest instability, which is a minor concern.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and some in the last month. Marijuana use alone isn't a strong predictor of high risk unless it's heavy or part of a larger substance abuse issue.\n\nHe sometimes feels down emotionally. Feeling down occasionally is common and doesn't necessarily indicate severe mental health issues unless it's persistent or leads to more concerning behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 10. A stable family environment can be protective against risk factors, though a larger household might have its own stressors. However, having both parents present is generally positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce risky behaviors, so this might be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The main concerns are the arrest without conviction and possible emotional issues. However, without more severe indicators like convictions, substance abuse beyond marijuana, or serious mental health problems, these don't add up to high risk. Most factors here are low to moderate risks, with some being neutral or even protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
