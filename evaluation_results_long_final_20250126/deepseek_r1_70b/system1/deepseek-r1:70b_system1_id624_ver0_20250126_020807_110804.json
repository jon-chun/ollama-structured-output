    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old Hispanic male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can still be concerning as they suggest repeated involvement with law enforcement, though it doesn't necessarily mean guilt. I'll note that as a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's 19, male, and Hispanic. Age and gender can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, especially in younger males. His ethnicity might not directly relate to risk but could be contextual based on societal factors.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to add much here\u2014probably a low factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, but it might indicate less social support or stability. Not having a high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor, as lack of education can limit opportunities and increase likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nNo jobs in the past year is another red flag. Unemployment, especially when combined with no education, can lead to higher crime rates due to economic necessity or idle time.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor as it might impair judgment or lead to more serious substance issues. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, mental health isn't an immediate concern here.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with both biological parents in a large household of 10 in a rural area. A stable family structure is usually protective, but growing up in a crowded household might have its own stressors or limitations in resources. Rural areas can sometimes lack opportunities and resources, which could be a factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behavior, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and living situation are significant. His age and gender also play into higher risk statistically. However, the absence of convictions, stable family upbringing, and current mental state (not feeling depressed) might lower the risk a bit. Still, the accumulation of several negative factors leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
