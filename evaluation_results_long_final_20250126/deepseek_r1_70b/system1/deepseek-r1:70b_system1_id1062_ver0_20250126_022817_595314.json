    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this individual poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22 years old. Younger individuals might have higher crime rates because of less life stability and more impulsive behavior. That could be a risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that in some areas, there are biases, but I shouldn't let that influence the assessment; it's more about individual factors rather than race.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate a lower risk since he wasn't found guilty. Maybe it was a minor offense or a misunderstanding.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and between 125-149 lbs. That's average to slight build, which doesn't necessarily relate to criminal behavior unless considering physical crimes, but not sure how significant this is.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less social support or more isolation, but being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual. Not a strong indicator either way.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a high school diploma is positive; however, not being enrolled in college might mean he's working or looking for work. Only holding one job in the past year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. However, he hasn't used in the past month, so maybe he's stopped or reduced usage, which is a positive sign.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but since he isn't feeling depressed now, that's a good sign. It might mean he's more stable mentally.\n\nLiving with biological mother in a household of 5 as a child. Growing up in a larger family might have its challenges, especially in urban areas where resources could be strained. However, having both biological parents can sometimes provide stability, so this is mixed.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or moral framework, which might lower the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: he's young and has some risk factors like drug use and job instability, but also protective factors like education, no recent mental health issues, and religious beliefs. The arrest without conviction doesn't weigh too heavily against him. So overall, while there are some risks, they aren't strong enough to indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
