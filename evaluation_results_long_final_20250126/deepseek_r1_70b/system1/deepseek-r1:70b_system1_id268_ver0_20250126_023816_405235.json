    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 21 and Hispanic. Age might be a factor since younger individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates. Being Hispanic itself isn't directly a risk factor, but it could relate to socioeconomic factors not mentioned here.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's significant because prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. Each arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal risk unless we're considering physical strength for certain crimes, but without more context, I'll set that aside.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against crime, so having only a high school diploma without further education could be a minor risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it indicates potential issues with employment, which can lead to criminal behavior if someone turns to illegal activities out of desperation or lack of stable income.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can impair judgment and increase likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk compared to someone with mental health issues, but I'm not sure how much that weighs against other factors.\n\nHis upbringing was stable; he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background is a protective factor, so this might reduce his risk.\n\nBelief in God can have mixed effects. Some studies suggest religious beliefs can deter criminal behavior by providing moral guidance and social support. So this could be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. Drug use adds to the risk, as does job instability and living alone. However, stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some of that risk. The absence of recent depression is a slight positive. I'm leaning towards him being a moderate risk, so maybe 68% confidence in high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 68\n}\n```",
