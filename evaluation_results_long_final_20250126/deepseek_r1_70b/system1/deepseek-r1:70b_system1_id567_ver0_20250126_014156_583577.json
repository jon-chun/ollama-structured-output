    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. However, younger individuals might have less life stability, which could influence behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests that maybe the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This is different from a conviction, so it's a bit of a neutral point\u2014some risk but not as high as a conviction.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5'10\" and 145 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a significant factor here unless we're considering something else, but I don't think height or weight alone are strong indicators.\n\nHe is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor. Having a supportive relationship might lower the risk of criminal behavior since he has a stable home environment.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk because it might limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability. But he's held two jobs this year, which shows some employment stability, so that could offset the lack of education.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive. Substance abuse and mental health issues are known risk factors for criminal behavior, so their absence lowers the risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a rural area in a household of size three. A stable family environment with both biological parents can be protective against delinquency. Rural areas might have different dynamics compared to urban settings, but generally, a stable home is a good sign.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community support, which are protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young with an arrest but no conviction, married with a spouse, employed despite lack of education, no substance abuse or mental health issues, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. These factors lean more towards low risk rather than high. The only potential concerns are the lack of education and the arrest, but other factors seem to mitigate those risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
