    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. I'm looking at the factors provided for this individual and trying to determine if they indicate a high risk.\n\nFirst off, she's a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age is a factor here; younger individuals might be considered higher risk because of potential impulsivity or lack of life experience. Being part of any specific demographic doesn't inherently increase risk, but it's context-dependent.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can indicate either that she was charged but not found guilty, which is a positive sign, or perhaps she's had run-ins with the law but hasn't faced severe consequences yet. The lack of conviction might lower her risk profile compared to someone with actual convictions.\n\nHer physical description\u20145'2\" and 125-149 lbs\u2014is pretty average and doesn't inherently indicate a risk factor unless in specific contexts like physical altercations, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest some level of independence or perhaps isolation. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability, but being single isn't a direct risk indicator.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could be a red flag. Education often correlates with stability and opportunities; without it, she might face more challenges that could lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year, which might indicate instability in employment. Unstable employment can be linked to financial stressors, which sometimes contribute to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor here\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for both criminal behavior and recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\n\nShe's reported feeling down at times, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health struggles can increase risk if not properly managed, as they might contribute to substance abuse or other problematic behaviors.\n\nHer upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban household of six. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally protective against high-risk behavior. However, living in an urban area could expose her to higher crime rates or negative influences, which might offset some of the protective factors from her family background.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, and mental health concerns are risk factors pointing towards higher risk. However, the stable family background, religious beliefs, and no prior convictions might mitigate some of that risk. So while there are concerning elements, they aren't overwhelming without more information on severity or other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
