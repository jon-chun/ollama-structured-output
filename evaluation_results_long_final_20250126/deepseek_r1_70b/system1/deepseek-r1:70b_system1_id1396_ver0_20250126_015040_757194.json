    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but without more context, it's hard to say if that alone indicates risk. Young males might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point. Arrests and convictions are usually indicators of past behavior which could suggest a likelihood of reoffending. However, one arrest doesn't necessarily mean high risk, especially if it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 3 inches, and he weighs between 175-199 lbs. Physical size alone isn't a strong indicator unless it's related to the type of crime, like assault or something where strength might be a factor. Without knowing the nature of his arrest, this might not weigh heavily.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability, but being single doesn't inherently mean high risk. Living alone could indicate independence, which isn't necessarily a bad sign.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism, so not pursuing college might be a minor concern, but having a diploma shows he completed his basic education.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment history can be a good indicator of stability. Having multiple jobs could mean he's responsible and capable of maintaining employment, which is a positive sign. However, job changes might also indicate instability if they're frequent or without a clear progression.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive factor. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for criminal behavior, so his abstinence suggests lower risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is another positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if untreated. His current mental state seems stable.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents at a young age in a household of size five. A stable family background is generally a protective factor against high-risk behavior. Growing up with both parents can provide emotional support and structure.\n\nBelieves that God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a moral framework and community support, which are associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest and conviction are concerning, but other factors like stable family background, employment, no drug use, and religious beliefs suggest he might not be high risk. The lack of recent negative factors in his life probably lowers his overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
