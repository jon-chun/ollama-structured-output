    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but without more context, it's hard to say. Being young might mean less life experience, which could be a factor, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. An arrest without conviction doesn't automatically mean he's guilty or high risk, so this is something to consider but maybe not a major red flag. It depends on the nature of the arrest, which isn't provided here.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 155 lbs. That's a bit underweight for his height, according to BMI standards. But physical build alone doesn't indicate risk unless there's something else pointing towards violence or aggression, which isn't mentioned.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might just mean he's in college or starting his independence, which is pretty normal. No direct risk factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor. Being in college suggests he's on a stable path, which would lower the risk rather than increase it.\n\nHe held one job during the past year. Having steady employment is a good sign; it shows responsibility, so this might actually be a protective factor against high risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and some during the last month. Marijuana use alone isn't typically a major risk factor unless it's heavy or part of a larger substance abuse issue. It doesn't seem to be indicated here as problematic beyond occasional use.\n\nHe sometimes felt down recently, feeling that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates possible depression or low mental health, which can be a risk factor if untreated. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of risky behavior, but again, it's not definitive without more information on severity or treatment.\n\nHis upbringing: He lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. Growing up with both parents is generally a stable environment and can be protective against high-risk behaviors. Rural areas might have different social dynamics, but without negative indicators like abuse or neglect, this seems positive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and community involvement.\n\nPutting it all together: The main potential red flags are the arrest (though no conviction) and the occasional feelings of depression. However, other factors like education, employment, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are protective. Marijuana use is present but not at a level that's typically concerning on its own. His age could be a factor in impulsive behavior, but he's also engaged in positive activities like college.\n\nSo, while there are some points to consider, overall the factors don't strongly indicate a high risk. The confidence might be around 20% because of the arrest and mental health, but the other aspects bring it down.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
