    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals are sometimes at higher risk because of impulsivity, but 20 isn't extremely young. Being male might increase risk slightly compared to females, but race alone isn't typically a significant factor without other context.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean that either he hasn't committed serious offenses or the charges didn't hold up in court. It does show some involvement with the law, though, which might indicate a higher risk than someone with no arrests.\n\nHis physical build is 6 feet 1 inch and 180 lbs. While this doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior, it could be relevant in certain contexts like violent crimes where physical strength might play a role, but without other factors, it's not a major indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially if he's just starting his independence post-high school. Not being married is common at this age, so I don't see this as a significant risk factor unless there are underlying issues with social relationships or isolation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective against criminal behavior; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could indirectly relate to future risks if he struggles with employment.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job stability is important. Having had just one job could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can be a risk factor as it relates to financial stress and potential desperation.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so abstinence here lowers his risk profile.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is another positive indicator since mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing was stable\u2014he lived with both biological parents in an urban area of four people. A stable family environment is protective against many negative outcomes, including criminal behavior. Growing up in an urban area might have its own challenges, but the family support likely mitigates that.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor as religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism and better social integration.\n\nPutting it all together: The two arrests without convictions are concerning, indicating possible experimentation or minor offenses. His stable upbringing, lack of drug use, good mental health, and religious beliefs are strong positive factors. Limited job stability is a slight concern but not a major one. Overall, these factors lean more towards lower risk despite the arrests.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
