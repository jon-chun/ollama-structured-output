    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but they're not definitive on their own. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without other indicators, it's neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things\u2014it might have been a misunderstanding or a minor offense that didn't lead to a conviction. But it does show some level of involvement with the law, which is worth noting.\n\nHis height and weight\u20145'11\" and 168 lbs\u2014are pretty average, so I don't see those as significant risk factors one way or the other.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate a lack of strong social support networks, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's at higher risk. Marriage isn't a guarantee against criminal behavior either.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive sign. Not being in college might mean he's working or focusing on other things, which doesn't inherently increase risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a factor; frequent job changes might indicate instability, but holding two jobs could also show responsibility depending on the context. Without more info on why he changed jobs, it's hard to say.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive signs. Substance abuse is often linked with higher risk, so not using drugs is a good indicator. Not feeling depressed recently also suggests better mental health, which can reduce impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area of household size three. A stable family environment with both parents is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't feel that God has anything to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, as religion can provide a moral framework and community support. But this varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest is a red flag but without conviction, so less severe. Other factors like stable family background, no drug use, no mental health issues, and having a diploma are protective. The only other potential concern is living alone and job changes, but these aren't strong indicators on their own. Overall, the risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
