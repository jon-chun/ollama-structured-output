    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher crime rates, but being female generally lowers the risk compared to males. Her ethnicity doesn't directly indicate risk, so that's neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests maybe it was a minor offense or she wasn't found guilty, which could lower the risk. No prior convictions is a good sign.\n\nHer height is 5'1\", which I don't think is relevant to criminal behavior, so that can be disregarded.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual these days; it doesn't necessarily indicate instability. Not being married might mean she's focused on her career or education, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is positive because it provides skills and opportunities, which can reduce criminal tendencies. Not being enrolled doesn't necessarily increase risk unless she's unemployed or underemployed.\n\nShe held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a concern. Frequently changing jobs might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to financial instability, but it could also mean she's exploring different career paths. Without knowing why she changed jobs, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are both positive indicators. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so her abstinence lowers the risk. Mental health stability also reduces the likelihood of impulsive or harmful behavior.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with six people. A stable family environment is a protective factor against criminal behavior. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents might mitigate that risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. This could mean she's less likely to be part of a religious community, which sometimes provides support and reduces criminal behavior. However, not believing in divine influence doesn't inherently increase risk unless it leads to social isolation, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a stable upbringing, no drug use, mentally stable, employed (though job changes), and no convictions. The arrest is the only concern, but without conviction, it's less severe. Her overall profile seems low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
