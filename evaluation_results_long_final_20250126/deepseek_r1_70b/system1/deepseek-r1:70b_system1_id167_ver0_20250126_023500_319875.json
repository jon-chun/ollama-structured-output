    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, but only one isn't too bad. Next, his physical attributes: 6'1\" and 155 lbs. That seems underweight for his height, maybe indicating possible health issues or substance use, but not directly a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor. His education is a GED and he's in a 4-year college, so that shows some stability and effort to improve himself, which is a positive sign.\n\nNo jobs held during the year\u2014unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or boredom leading to criminal activity. But he's enrolled in college, so maybe he's focusing on studies instead of working.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as high-risk as other drugs, but any drug use can indicate potential issues. However, he hasn't used it recently if he only used it in the past four years.\n\nNo depression in the past month, which is good because mental health issues can increase risk. His upbringing: lived with his biological mother in a small household. That seems stable, so less of a risk factor there.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with what happens to him personally. I'm not sure how significant that is, but maybe it relates to lack of social or community ties, which could be a minor risk.\n\nPutting it all together: one conviction, unemployment, drug use, living alone are potential risks. But he's in college and no recent depression. So the overall risk might be moderate.\n</think>\n\nThe individual presents with several factors that could indicate a moderate risk profile, including a prior conviction, unemployment, past drug use, and living alone. However, his enrollment in college suggests stability efforts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
