    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm looking at the risk factors provided for this individual and trying to determine if they indicate a high risk. \n\nFirst off, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is a factor here; younger males are generally considered higher risk in some contexts because of potential impulsivity. His height and weight\u20146 feet tall and 204 lbs\u2014might be relevant in terms of physical presence or potential for violence, but alone it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean several things. It might have been a minor offense, or perhaps the charges were dropped. Without a conviction, the severity is a bit unclear, so I'm not sure how much weight to give this factor. It's something to consider but maybe not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't in college. Education level can be a risk factor because lower educational attainment sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates. However, having a GED shows he made an effort to complete his education, which might be a positive sign.\n\nEmployment history: He held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with responsibility or reliability. Frequent job changes might suggest problems with maintaining employment, which can correlate with higher risk behaviors as unstable individuals might engage in criminal activities out of necessity or due to lack of structure.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor here. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior because it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to involvement in illegal activities. The type of drugs matters too\u2014cocaine is more associated with higher risk behaviors than marijuana.\n\nLiving situation: He's not living alone right now. Living with others might provide some stability or support, which could be a protective factor against high-risk behavior. On the other hand, if he's living in an unstable household, that could pose risks, but we don't have information on the current living conditions beyond the size when he was young.\n\nFamily background: He lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a large household might indicate resource strain or less individual attention, which can sometimes contribute to behavioral issues. Urban environments can also have higher crime rates and exposure to risk factors.\n\nHe doesn't feel that God has anything to do with what happens to him personally. Lack of religious affiliation can be neutral, but some studies suggest that religious involvement can serve as a protective factor against delinquency. However, this isn't always the case, and it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, so not feeling depressed might be a positive sign. But without knowing his mental health history beyond the past month, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of drug use and job instability are concerning factors that point towards higher risk. However, he doesn't have a conviction, has a GED, and isn't showing current depression. His living situation might offer some support, which could mitigate risks. Considering these elements, I would lean towards him being at moderate risk but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
