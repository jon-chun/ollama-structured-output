    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a criminal justice risk assessment. The person is a 22-year-old Black female with one arrest but no conviction. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, age: 22 is young but not a minor. Younger offenders can sometimes have higher recidivism rates, especially if they don't have strong support systems.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That means she might not have a criminal record, which could lower her risk since a conviction often correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'9\" and between 175-199 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical build factors into risk assessment models; maybe it's more about whether she poses a physical threat, but without other violent indicators, this might not be significant.\n\nShe's never been married and doesn't live alone. Living with others could indicate a support system, which is a protective factor against recidivism. Not being married at 22 isn't unusual and probably doesn't add much risk on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending if she can't find stable employment.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, which may drive criminal behavior. This could be a red flag.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana is less serious than other drugs, but any drug use can indicate issues with substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can increase criminal behavior risks. However, the absence of recent depression doesn't necessarily mean she's free from other issues.\n\nHer upbringing: She lived with her biological mother in an urban area with four people. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and fewer resources, but living with a biological parent is generally a protective factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk by giving a sense of purpose or community.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of conviction, living situation, and spiritual beliefs are positive factors. However, unemployment and drug use are concerning. Her age might make her more susceptible to peer influence or impulsive decisions. Without more severe criminal history, the overall risk seems moderate. I'm leaning towards a lower risk assessment because she hasn't been convicted and has some protective factors in place.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
