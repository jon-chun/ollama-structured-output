    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being White isn't particularly indicative on its own either.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest that the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty, which is a positive sign. It shows he hasn't been officially found guilty of a crime yet.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 2 inches and over 250 lbs. While physical size can sometimes be a factor in certain contexts, it's not directly linked to criminal risk without other aggressive behavior indicators.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, especially if he's in school. Not being married could mean less stability, but it's also common for someone his age.\n\nEnrolled in school is a positive factor. Education often correlates with lower recidivism rates as it provides structure and opportunities.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, showing responsibility and engagement in productive activities.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use alone isn't a strong indicator of high risk unless it's frequent or part of a pattern with other substances. It\u2019s also common among many people without leading to criminal behavior.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month is positive. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, so this is a good sign.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor against high risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but living with both parents can mitigate that.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support system, which are generally associated with lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest without conviction, enrollment in school, employment history, stable upbringing, and lack of current mental health issues are strong positive indicators. While the drug use is a minor concern, it's not enough on its own to signify high risk. Overall, these factors lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
