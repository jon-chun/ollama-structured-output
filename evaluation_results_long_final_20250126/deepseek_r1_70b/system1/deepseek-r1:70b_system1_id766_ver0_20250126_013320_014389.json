    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher impulsivity, but being female typically correlates with lower risk in many models. Her race doesn't particularly indicate a heightened risk on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction could suggest some level of risk, but it's not extensive. It depends on the nature of the offense, which isn't provided here. If it was a minor offense, that might lower the risk assessment.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145 feet 3 inches and 155 lbs\u2014don't directly indicate any criminal propensity. Physical build alone isn't a strong predictor unless considering specific crimes where strength is a factor, but that's speculative without more context.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, often associated with lower recidivism rates as it suggests social support and responsibility.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective; having a diploma is positive, though not pursuing higher education doesn't necessarily raise the risk on its own.\n\nEmployment history: She held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, indicating responsibility. However, having multiple jobs might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a concern if it's due to behavioral issues.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and, while illegal in some places, isn't as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine. However, any drug use can indicate potential issues depending on frequency and context.\n\nMental health: No depression reported in the past month. This is a positive indicator since mental health issues often correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nUpbringing: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size five in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment with both biological parents is generally a protective factor against delinquency, even if it's a larger family. Rural areas might have different dynamics but aren't inherently risky unless combined with other factors like isolation or lack of resources.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes God influences her personal events. Religious affiliation can be a protective factor, often associated with lower recidivism due to social networks and moral frameworks.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of a conviction and past drug use are the main risk factors. However, she has several protective factors\u2014stable marriage, employment, high school diploma, religious beliefs, and stable upbringing\u2014which likely mitigate these risks. Her lack of recent mental health issues further supports a lower risk assessment. Therefore, while there are some concerns, they're outweighed by the protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
