    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. His age and gender might be relevant because statistically, young males can sometimes have higher crime rates, but I don't know if that alone is a strong indicator here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That means there was an incident where he was taken into custody, but it didn't lead to a conviction. So, maybe the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could indicate some level of risk, but since there's no conviction, I'm not sure how much weight that carries.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 155 lbs, which is pretty average. I don't think physical build has a direct correlation with criminal risk unless we're talking about violent crimes where strength might be a factor, but without more context, this probably isn't a significant factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean he doesn't have a strong support system, which might contribute to higher risk factors if someone feels isolated or lacks community ties. On the other hand, not being married at 20 is pretty normal, so that alone isn't a red flag.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor because it often leads to better job opportunities and stability. Not attending college doesn't necessarily mean he's at risk; many people choose other paths like work or vocational training.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial stress or personal problems that could increase risk. However, changing jobs isn't uncommon for someone just starting their career, so it depends on the context of why he changed jobs.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor here. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can be linked to higher risk behaviors, especially if it's frequent or associated with other issues like criminal activity to support drug habits. However, occasional use might not necessarily lead to high-risk behavior, but it's something to consider.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to risky behaviors. But without knowing his longer-term mental health history, it's hard to say if this offsets other risk factors.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area of three people. Growing up in a stable family environment usually reduces risk factors, but living in an urban area could expose him to higher crime rates or influences depending on the neighborhood.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective against risky behaviors. It might help him make better choices and have a support network through his faith community.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest without conviction is a point of concern but not definitive. Drug use is a risk factor that stands out more because it's directly linked to potential criminal activity or behavioral issues. However, other factors like stable upbringing, education, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. Job changes are neutral unless there's a pattern of instability.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a moderate risk, but considering the structure here requires a binary YES/NO with confidence, I think it's more on the lower side because he doesn't have multiple significant high-risk factors beyond drug use and an arrest. So maybe a NO with around 20% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
