    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors; young males are often associated with higher crime rates, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. That's a red flag because prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. Recidivism tends to be higher in individuals with a history of convictions.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant unless we're considering physical intimidation, but I'm not sure if that's a standard risk factor. Maybe it could relate to certain types of crimes, but I'll set that aside for now.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor against criminal behavior because they provide support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky activities. Marriage has been shown in some studies to lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is another factor; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, so not having more than a high school diploma might be a slight risk, but he does have a diploma which is positive.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a protective factor as it provides stability and income, reducing the need to engage in criminal activities. However, job instability (changing jobs frequently) could indicate issues, but having two jobs might mean he's employable and trying to improve his situation.\n\nDrug use is a significant risk factor. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is strongly linked with criminal behavior because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in drug-related crimes. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk of substance abuse for self-medication purposes.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban household of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor against delinquency. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents might mitigate that to some extent.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor as they often provide a moral framework and community support, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior convictions and drug use are significant risk factors indicating higher risk. However, being married, employed, having a stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are protective factors that might lower the overall risk. His age is on the younger side but not extremely high risk by itself.\n\nI think the presence of two convictions and drug use leans towards high risk, but the mitigating factors like marriage and employment might reduce the confidence level in that assessment. So maybe a moderate to high risk, but I'm not 100% certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
