    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender are known risk factors; young males, especially in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher rates of offending. So that's a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant predictor of future criminal behavior. Even one conviction can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending compared to someone with no convictions. That leans towards high risk.\n\nHis height and weight (5'10\", 190 lbs) don't particularly stand out as risk factors unless we're considering physical strength in certain types of crimes, but I think this is less relevant than other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a protective factor; being single or unmarried might indicate less stable social ties, which could correlate with higher risk. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual these days, so maybe not as significant on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is generally a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of criminal behavior. Lack of stable employment can lead to financial instability, which increases the risk of recidivism.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it's linked to higher rates of offending. Substances can lower inhibitions and impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's mentally stable. The absence of recent depression might be a positive sign, but without more information on his mental health history, it's hard to assess this factor fully.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of size five when young. A stable family environment is usually a protective factor against delinquency. Growing up with both parents can reduce risk factors associated with broken homes or instability.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher risk, as religion often provides a moral framework and social support, which are protective against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: young male with a conviction, unemployed, drug use, single, not in college. These factors point towards a high risk. However, he has a stable family background and has a high school diploma, which might mitigate some risks. But the presence of prior conviction, unemployment, and drug use are strong indicators. I think the confidence should be fairly high but maybe around 80% because there are both positive and negative factors in play.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
