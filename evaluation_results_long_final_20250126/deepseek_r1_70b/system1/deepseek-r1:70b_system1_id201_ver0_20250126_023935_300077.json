    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but without specific context on how these relate to risk, they might not weigh heavily here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean different things\u2014maybe it was a minor offense or perhaps the charges were dropped. It\u2019s something to note but not necessarily a strong indicator alone.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'3\" and 160 lbs. I don't see how height and weight directly relate to risk assessment unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is pretty common, so that might not be a significant factor. Living situation could indicate some stability or lack thereof, but it\u2019s not clear from this info alone.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not in college. This is a red flag because education level can correlate with employment opportunities and stability, which are risk factors for recidivism or other behaviors.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might be linked to higher risk if it's due to behavioral problems or other underlying issues.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That\u2019s a positive sign; substance abuse is often a significant risk factor, so abstinence is good.\n\nShe sometimes feels down emotionally. Feeling down can relate to mental health issues, but without more severity (like diagnosed depression), it might not be as concerning unless it's leading to other behaviors.\n\nLived in a household of four as a child. Household size isn't directly telling; maybe related to socioeconomic status or support systems.\n\nBelieves God is involved in her life. This could provide emotional support and stability, which would be a protective factor against risk.\n\nPutting this all together: The lack of education and job instability are concerning, but the absence of drug use and a belief system might mitigate some risks. Without more severe indicators like convictions or substance abuse, it seems she's not in the high-risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
