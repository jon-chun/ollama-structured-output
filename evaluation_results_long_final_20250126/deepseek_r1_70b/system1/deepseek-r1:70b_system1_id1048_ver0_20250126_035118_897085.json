His age is young, which can be a risk factor since younger individuals might still be developing impulse control.\n\nHe's shorter and lighter, but physical build isn't a major predictor of criminal behavior. Not being married and living alone could indicate instability or lack of social support, which might increase recidivism risk.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive factor\u2014it shows he\u2019s trying to improve his situation. However, having no jobs in the past year suggests unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and idle time.\n\nDrug use is significant here\u2014using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some recent use. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and can impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which might indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental illness can contribute to criminal behavior if it leads to poor decision-making or substance abuse as self-medication.\n\nHis upbringing with his biological mother in an urban area of size 4 isn\u2019t inherently risky, but urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences. His belief that God doesn't influence his life might reduce protective factors like religious support, which sometimes helps in rehabilitation.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014especially the multiple arrests, convictions, unemployment, drug use, mental health concerns, and lack of social support\u2014it seems he's at high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
