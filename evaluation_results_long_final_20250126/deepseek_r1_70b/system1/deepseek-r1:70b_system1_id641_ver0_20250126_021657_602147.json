    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. The person in question is a 19-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. I know that prior convictions can be a significant factor in recidivism, but since it's only one conviction, I'm not sure how much weight that carries.\n\nShe's living alone, which might indicate some level of independence, but without more context on her support system, it's hard to say if this is a risk factor. Her education is a GED, so she has a basic education but isn't in college. Employment-wise, she's had three jobs in the past year, which could suggest instability or perhaps she's just exploring different career paths. Unstable employment can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive because substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. However, she has felt down lately, which might indicate mental health issues. Depression or low mood can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in an urban area, which doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there were other negative factors at play. She doesn't see God as influencing her life, but I'm not sure how much that ties into recidivism risk\u2014it might relate more to personal coping mechanisms or support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: one conviction, some employment instability, recent feelings of depression, but no drug use and a stable living situation. The mental health aspect could be concerning if it leads to further issues, but overall, the factors don't scream high risk. I'm leaning towards low risk with moderate confidence because there's a mix of positive and negative indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
