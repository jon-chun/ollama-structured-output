    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors in criminal behavior, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. His race might not be directly relevant unless there are specific societal factors at play, which aren't indicated here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction could be a concern, but the severity of the offense isn't mentioned. If it's a minor offense, the risk might be lower. Without knowing the nature of the crime, I can't weigh this factor too heavily, but it does indicate some level of past involvement in criminal activity.\n\nHis physical stature is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 120 lbs. Generally, physical size isn't a strong predictor of recidivism or risk unless considering specific contexts where physical strength might be a factor, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently not living alone. His marital status and living situation could relate to stability. Living with others might provide social support, which is a positive factor, potentially lowering the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually a protective factor against criminal behavior. Being enrolled suggests he's engaged in productive activities, which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nEmployment-wise, he held one job during the year. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal activity as it provides income and structure. However, having only one job might indicate some instability or short-term employment, but without more context, it's hard to assess its impact.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, so his abstinence is a positive sign. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces the likelihood of mental health issues contributing to risky behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with his biological mother in an urban area with five people. Growing up in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or environmental stressors, but living with family can provide support and stability. The household size being five isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes influence behavior, but the absence of such beliefs doesn't inherently increase criminal risk unless it's linked to other factors like lack of empathy or impulsivity, which aren't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together: he has some positive factors like education, employment, no drug use, and stable living situation. The single arrest and conviction are concerns, but without knowing the severity, it's hard to gauge their impact. Overall, these factors don't strongly indicate a high risk of criminal behavior or recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
