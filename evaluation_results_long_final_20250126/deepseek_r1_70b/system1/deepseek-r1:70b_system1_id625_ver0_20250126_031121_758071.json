    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on these factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but they're pretty general. Being young might mean less life experience, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction suggests that maybe the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. That's a point to consider because an arrest alone isn't a conviction, so it's not as severe as having a criminal record with convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 5 inches and 220 lbs. While being physically large could be a factor in certain contexts, like the ability to commit certain crimes, it doesn't inherently make someone a risk. It's more about behavior than physical stature.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual; many people that age live alone or with roommates. Marital status might relate to stability, but being unmarried is pretty common for his age group.\n\nEnrolled in school currently is a positive factor. Education often correlates with lower criminal behavior because it indicates engagement in productive activities and possibly better future prospects.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor; having a job might mean he has responsibilities and income, which could reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a significant positive indicator. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so abstinence from drugs suggests lower risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes be linked to higher risk, but not feeling depressed recently is a good sign. It doesn't mean he never had issues, just that currently, he's stable.\n\nLiving with his biological father at a young age in a household of size three suggests a relatively stable family environment. Growing up with both parents can provide support and reduce certain risks associated with broken homes or neglect.\n\nBelieves that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, as they often provide a moral framework and community support, which are associated with lower risk behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: young age with an arrest but no conviction, enrolled in school, employed, stable family background, no drug use, mentally stable now, religious involvement. The only red flag is the arrest, but without a conviction, it's not as concerning. Most other factors point towards low risk. So overall, I think he's not a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
