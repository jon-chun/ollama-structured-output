    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher tendencies towards risky behavior. However, being Hispanic alone isn't necessarily a risk factor\u2014it's more about individual circumstances.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests without convictions could mean several things\u2014maybe the charges were dropped, or he's still going through the legal process. It does show some involvement with the law, which might be a concern.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 6 feet tall and 185 lbs. While this gives a description, height and weight alone aren't direct indicators of criminal risk unless we're considering specific contexts where size might play a role, like certain types of assault or theft.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone could suggest independence but also might indicate a lack of strong social support networks. Marriage often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides stability, so not being married isn't necessarily bad on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually acts as a protective factor against criminal behavior. Being enrolled suggests he's motivated towards betterment, which could reduce risk factors.\n\nHe held four jobs during the year. Job instability might indicate issues with maintaining employment, which can be a stressor and potentially lead to illegal activities if someone is struggling financially. However, it's also possible that he's exploring different career paths or hasn't found the right fit yet.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Marijuana is a common drug, and while illegal in some places, its impact on criminal risk varies. Chronic use could be a concern if it affects behavior or decision-making.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors. Not feeling depressed might lower the risk compared to someone who is struggling mentally.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size three at a young age. A smaller household could mean more individual attention from parents, which is generally a positive factor. It doesn't immediately indicate neglect or instability unless other factors are present.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens personally. Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and social support, which often reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young with some arrests but no convictions, which is concerning but not definitive. His educational enrollment and religious beliefs are positive factors. Job instability could be a stressor, but without more context on why he's had multiple jobs, it's hard to weigh heavily. No depression and living alone aren't major risks on their own.\n\nI think the main concerns are the arrests and job changes, but they're balanced by education and religious beliefs. I don't see strong indicators of high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
