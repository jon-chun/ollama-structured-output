    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males in their late teens to early twenties, are often associated with higher crime rates due to impulsive behavior and still-developing decision-making skills. That could be a risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that systemic issues can sometimes lead to over-policing or higher arrest rates in certain communities, but I'm not sure how much this directly relates to recidivism risk. It's more about societal factors than individual behavior.\n\nHe was arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests without convictions might indicate less severe offenses or cases where evidence wasn't sufficient. However, an arrest does show some level of involvement in potentially risky activities.\n\nHis physical build is 6 feet and 160 lbs. That's on the average to slim side for his height. I don't think body size alone is a strong predictor of criminal behavior unless it's extreme, which this isn't.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support or stability. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, so not being married could mean fewer ties to the community or family, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities and increase idle time, which can be risky.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce criminal behavior by providing income and structure. However, having multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor if it leads to financial stress.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, as it can impair judgment and lead to involvement in drug-related crimes. However, marijuana is less severe than hard drugs, so this might not be as significant.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and unmotivated. Mental health issues like depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated, as they might lead to substance abuse or poor decision-making.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a two-parent household is generally protective against delinquency, but urban environments may have higher crime rates and exposure to risky behaviors.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor as they often provide moral guidance and community support, which might reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young with some instability in employment, recent drug use, and mental health concerns. These factors lean towards higher risk, but there are mitigating factors like stable upbringing and religious beliefs that might lower it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
