    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual poses a high risk based on the given factors.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: He's a 19-year-old male. Young males are generally considered higher risk for criminal behavior due to impulsive tendencies associated with youth.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: Arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity, which could suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n3. **Physical Build**: 5'8\" and 144 lbs. This is average build, not particularly indicative of high risk on its own unless considering potential for violence, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married and living alone. Being unmarried isn't a strong indicator, but living alone might suggest less social support or supervision, which can be a minor risk factor.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: GED certificate and not in college; held 4 jobs in a year. Multiple job changes could indicate instability, which is sometimes linked to higher recidivism. However, having a GED shows he has some education, which might lower the risk compared to someone without it.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use for four years and no recent depression. This is a positive sign as substance abuse is a major risk factor for criminal behavior. The absence here suggests lower risk.\n\n7. **Upbringing**: Lived with biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 4. Growing up in an urban environment can sometimes correlate with higher crime exposure, but living with both biological parents (assuming the father was present) is actually a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God influences personal events. Religious beliefs can have a moderating effect on behavior, often associated with lower recidivism rates as it provides a moral framework and social support.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together:\n\n- The presence of a prior conviction is concerning but it's only one instance.\n- Employment instability could be a risk, but he has held multiple jobs which might indicate an ability to find work, though frequent changes can suggest issues with stability.\n- No substance abuse or mental health issues are significant mitigating factors.\n- Stable upbringing and religious beliefs are protective.\n\nThe overall profile suggests that while there are some risk factors (age, criminal history), they are offset by several protective factors. Therefore, the individual is likely at a moderate rather than high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
