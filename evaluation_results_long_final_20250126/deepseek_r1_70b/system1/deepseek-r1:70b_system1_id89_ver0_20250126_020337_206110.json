    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger individuals might be at higher risk due to less life experience and potentially poorer impulse control. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe moderate risk here.\n\nGender: male. Statistically, males are more likely to engage in criminal behavior than females, but this is a general trend and not definitive.\n\nArrests without convictions: he's been arrested twice but not convicted. This could mean either that the charges were dropped or perhaps he's still within the justice system. Arrests indicate some level of involvement with the law, so this might elevate his risk profile.\n\nPhysical build: 5'11\" and 182 lbs is average to slightly above average in size. While physical strength can be a factor in certain crimes, it's not directly indicative on its own.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single isn't a risk factor per se, but living alone might reduce social support structures that could mitigate risky behavior.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not in college. Having a basic education doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk; in fact, it's a positive as he has a degree. Not being enrolled could mean he's working or otherwise occupied, so maybe neutral here.\n\nEmployment: held one job in the past year. Stable employment can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, suggesting responsibility and structure.\n\nSubstance use: no drug use in four years. This is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal activity, but his abstinence lowers this risk.\n\nMental health: no recent depression. Good mental health is a protective factor; individuals without current mental health issues are generally at lower risk of engaging in problematic behavior.\n\nUpbringing: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a positive sign. Growing up in an urban setting might have higher crime exposure, but with supportive parents, this could mitigate that risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God influences personal events. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against criminal behavior as it often provides moral guidance and community support.\n\nPutting all together: he's young, male, with some legal involvement (arrests) but no convictions. He has stable employment, good mental health, stable upbringing, and positive lifestyle choices. The arrests are concerning but without convictions, and other factors point towards lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
