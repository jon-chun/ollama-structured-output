    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals are generally considered higher risk because of impulsive behavior and less life experience. Being male might also be a factor, as statistics often show higher recidivism rates among males.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor for reoffending. It shows that he's had legal trouble before, which could indicate a pattern or disregard for the law.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal risk unless in specific contexts, but I'll note them as neutral factors here.\n\nNot being married and living alone at 19 might suggest instability or lack of strong social support networks. Marriage and family can be stabilizing influences, so their absence could elevate risk.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one, but not being enrolled in college might mean fewer opportunities or less engagement in positive activities that reduce criminal behavior.\n\nHolding two jobs in the past year suggests some employment stability, which is a positive factor. Steady employment can lower recidivism risk as it provides structure and income.\n\nDrug use is a big red flag. Using marijuana in the past four years and recently could indicate substance abuse issues, which are strongly linked to criminal behavior. It can impair judgment and decision-making.\n\nFeeling down or depressed some of the time might point to mental health issues. Untreated mental illness can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including criminal activity.\n\nHis upbringing with only his biological mother in an urban area could mean exposure to higher crime environments or less supervision, both risk factors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more access to illicit activities.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might provide some moral framework, which can be protective against criminal behavior. Religious beliefs can offer support and reduce recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, prior conviction, drug use, mental health issues, and living situation are risk factors. However, having a GED, employment history, and religious beliefs are mitigating factors. The presence of multiple significant risks like prior conviction and substance use might tip the scale towards high risk, but I'm not entirely certain without more context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
