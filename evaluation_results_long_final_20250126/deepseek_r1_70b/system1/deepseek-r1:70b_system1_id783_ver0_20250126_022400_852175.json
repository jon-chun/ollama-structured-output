    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let me break down each factor and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is a factor here; younger individuals might still be in a phase where they're more likely to engage in risky behaviors. Gender-wise, females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males, but that's not a hard rule.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does increase the likelihood of reoffending because past behavior can sometimes predict future actions. However, it's just one arrest and conviction, so I need to consider other factors alongside this.\n\nHer physical description is 5'4\" and 115 lbs, which doesn't particularly stand out as a risk factor. Being married could be a stabilizing influence, but she's living alone. Living alone might mean less social support or more isolation, which can sometimes contribute to higher risk if someone lacks a strong support network.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a significant factor; lower educational attainment is associated with higher recidivism rates because it can limit job opportunities and stability. Holding only one job in the past year suggests possible instability in employment, which is another risk factor as stable employment can reduce recidivism.\n\nDrug use is a big red flag. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is strongly correlated with criminal behavior and recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and engagement in illegal activities to support substance use. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk of certain negative outcomes related to mental health, but that's just one aspect.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in a household of size five when she was young. A larger family size could indicate possible stress or less individual attention, but not necessarily a direct risk factor unless other issues are present. Her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally might relate to her support system or coping mechanisms. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can be protective against recidivism, so lacking this might slightly increase risk.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, prior conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use are significant risk factors. However, being female and married might mitigate some risks. The absence of recent depression is a positive point but doesn't outweigh the negatives. So overall, there's a moderate to high risk indicated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
