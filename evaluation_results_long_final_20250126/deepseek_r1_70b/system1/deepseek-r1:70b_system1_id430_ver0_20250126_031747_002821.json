    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on criminal justice standards. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but being young doesn't necessarily equate to high risk. Her race isn't particularly relevant in most modern assessments unless there's specific context, which there isn't here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest she's at risk of future criminal behavior, but it's not definitive. It depends on the nature of the arrest and whether there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145'9\" and 160 lbs\u2014don't inherently indicate a risk factor unless we're considering specific contexts where size might matter, like certain types of crimes, but that's speculative without more info.\n\nShe is divorced. At 22, being divorced could indicate instability or stress, which sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors. However, divorce itself isn't a direct indicator of criminal risk.\n\nShe's not living alone, which means she has others around her, possibly providing support and reducing isolation. Social support can be a protective factor against high-risk behavior.\n\nShe has a GED certificate but isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit job opportunities, potentially increasing economic stress, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability can sometimes be linked to higher risk factors if it indicates difficulty maintaining employment, possibly due to behavioral issues or other underlying problems.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so her abstinence is a protective factor.\n\nShe's felt down most of the time recently, which could indicate depression. Mental health issues can sometimes increase the likelihood of risky behaviors if not properly managed. However, feeling down doesn't automatically translate to criminal risk without other factors.\n\nLiving in a household of size 3 at a young age\u2014this is fairly average and doesn't necessarily point to neglect or instability unless other adverse childhood experiences are present, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with her life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which for some people might be a protective factor against risky behavior. However, this varies individually and isn't a direct risk indicator.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young with one arrest but no conviction, has some indicators of instability (divorce, job changes), but also has protective factors like no drug use, living with others, and stable education (GED). The recent feelings of depression are concerning but not conclusive on their own. Overall, while there are some risk elements, they don't strongly indicate a high criminal risk. My confidence is around 20% that these factors point to a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
