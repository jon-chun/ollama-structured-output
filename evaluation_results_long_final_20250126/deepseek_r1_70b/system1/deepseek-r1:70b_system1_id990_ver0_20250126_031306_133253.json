    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals are sometimes considered higher risk because of impulsivity, but being female might lower that risk a bit since males often have higher crime rates. Her race doesn't particularly indicate higher or lower risk in this context.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests maybe it was a minor offense or perhaps she wasn't found guilty, which is a positive sign. It shows some involvement with the law, though.\n\nHer height and weight (5'7\", 175-199 lbs) don't immediately seem relevant unless considering physical strength in certain crimes, but that's probably not a major factor here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support or more freedom to engage in risky behavior without oversight. Never being married at 18 isn't unusual, so maybe not a big risk factor.\n\nEnrolled in school is a positive indicator; it suggests she's engaged in productive activities which can lower criminal risk. Having held two jobs in the past year indicates some stability and responsibility, another positive sign.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can increase criminal behavior risk, especially if it's frequent or leads to dependency, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe she's managing that aspect better.\n\nHer upbringing: lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 when young. A stable family structure is generally positive. However, considering she's now living alone at 18 might mean some changes, but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to say.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism in some studies, or maybe higher, depending on context. It\u2019s a bit mixed and might not be a strong indicator.\n\nPutting this all together: she's young with one arrest but no conviction, enrolled in school, employed, lives alone, has used drugs, stable family background. The drug use is concerning, as it can correlate with higher risk, but her current enrollment and employment are mitigating factors. She doesn't show signs of depression, which might lower the risk of some negative behaviors.\n\nOverall, while there's some risk due to drug use and an arrest, the presence of school and job suggests she's managing well. I'd lean towards low to moderate risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual presents with a mix of factors that suggest both potential risks and positive indicators. The arrest without conviction, along with past drug use, introduces some level of concern. However, enrollment in school and stable employment are strong mitigating factors. Considering these elements, the overall risk is assessed as low.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
