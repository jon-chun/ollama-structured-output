    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can play roles, but not sure how significant they are here. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted, which does indicate some level of criminal history. That could be a risk factor because prior convictions often correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and 115 lbs\u2014physical characteristics might not directly relate to criminal risk unless considering escape risks or something else, but I think that's less relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a factor; being single might mean less social support, which could increase risk. Living alone might also contribute if it leads to isolation, but not sure how much weight this holds.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is often a protective factor against recidivism because higher education can lead to better job opportunities and stability. So her not being enrolled could be a slight risk, but having a diploma might mitigate that a bit.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment history is important; consistent employment can reduce recidivism. Having only one job might indicate instability, which could increase risk factors.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor because it's linked to higher recidivism rates. However, marijuana is generally considered less severe than other drugs, so maybe not as high risk but still something to note.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, but she doesn't seem to be experiencing them now.\n\nHer upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area of four people. Growing up with two parents is usually a protective factor as it suggests stability. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so that could be a minor risk, but the stable family background likely offsets that.\n\nShe believes God has influence over her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing support and reducing risky behaviors, which would lower the risk assessment.\n\nPutting this all together: she has some risk factors like prior conviction, single job in a year, and drug use, but also protective factors such as stable upbringing, religious beliefs, no current depression, and having a high school diploma. On balance, it seems her risk isn't extremely high, so I'd lean towards low to moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
