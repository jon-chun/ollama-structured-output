    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female identifying as White. Her age and gender might influence risk, but they're not definitive on their own. \n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. Arrests can indicate potential issues, but without a conviction, it's hard to say if it was a serious offense or just a one-time mistake.\n\nHer physical build is 5'10\" and between 150-174 lbs. That doesn't seem unusual or indicative of risk; it's more about personal health than behavior.\n\nShe hasn't been married and isn't living alone. Living with others could mean support, which might lower risk factors. Not being married at 22 is pretty common these days, so that's probably not a big deal.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is in a graduate program. That shows she's motivated and has access to resources, which usually points to lower risk because education often correlates with stability.\n\nShe's had three jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a red flag, but it might also indicate she's exploring different opportunities or furthering her education, so it's not necessarily negative.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can increase risk, especially if it's recent or frequent. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean she's coping well or doesn't have underlying mental health issues that could escalate behavior.\n\nHer upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area with a household of six. Stable family background is usually a protective factor against high risk. Growing up in an urban area might expose her to more risks, but the supportive family could mitigate that.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risky behaviors as it often ties into community and structured lifestyle.\n\nPutting it all together: She's educated, has a stable upbringing, is socially connected (living with others), and while she's used drugs, there's no indication of current misuse or other concerning behaviors. The job changes might be a minor issue but not enough on their own to raise the risk significantly. Her lack of depression suggests she's mentally stable.\n\nSo overall, these factors don't strongly indicate a high risk. Most elements point towards lower risk despite some potential concerns like drug use and job instability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
