    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess whether this individual poses a high risk based on the provided factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can be risk factors; young males are statistically more likely to engage in criminal behavior, but being White doesn't particularly indicate higher risk on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant factor because it indicates past involvement in criminal activity. However, only one arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, so this could go either way.\n\nHis physical stature is 5 feet 6 inches and 130 lbs. While smaller build might influence certain types of crimes, it's not a direct indicator of higher recidivism or risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, so being unmarried and living alone might suggest less stability, which could increase risk slightly.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against criminal behavior, so having a diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education doesn't necessarily raise the risk much.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, suggesting some responsibility and engagement with society, which might lower his risk.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and sometimes during the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it leads to dependency or impairment. However, marijuana is generally considered less risky than harder drugs.\n\nHe's felt down at times in the past month. Mental health issues like depression can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior if untreated, but feeling down occasionally isn't as severe as diagnosed mental illness.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. Living with a biological parent is generally positive; urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence risk exposure.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, potentially lowering recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior conviction and drug use are concerning, but he also has some protective factors like employment, education, and religious beliefs. His age is a neutral factor. I'm leaning towards moderate risk, so confidence might be around 60%. But since the prediction needs to be YES or NO, considering the presence of prior conviction and drug use, even with other factors, it's still a cautious yes for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
