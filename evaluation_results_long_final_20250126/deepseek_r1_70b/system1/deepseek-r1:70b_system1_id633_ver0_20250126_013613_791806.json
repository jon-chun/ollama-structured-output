    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors step by step. Let's start with the demographic information. The individual is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can be risk factors; young males are statistically more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted, which indicates a history of offending. That's a significant factor because prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145 feet 9 inches and 180 lbs\u2014don't particularly stand out as risk factors on their own unless they're linked to aggression, but that's not specified here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a protective factor; being single might mean less stability or fewer ties to the community, which could increase risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor as it can limit employment opportunities and lead to unemployment, which is another risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment or low employment can contribute to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nDrug use is a major red flag. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which indicates substance abuse issues. Drug use is strongly correlated with criminal behavior, both as a direct effect and through its impact on decision-making and associations.\n\nHis mental state is concerning; he's felt down most of the time in the past month. Depression can increase risk factors if left untreated, leading to impulsivity or other behaviors that might escalate into criminal actions.\n\nLooking at his upbringing: he lived with both biological parents in a large household (size 6) in an urban area. While living with both parents is generally positive, growing up in a crowded household in an urban setting could expose him to higher crime environments and stressors, which are risk factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral guidance and community support, but it depends on how he integrates these beliefs into his behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior arrests, convictions, substance abuse, unstable employment, lack of education, living alone, mental health issues\u2014all point towards high risk. His belief in God might slightly mitigate some factors, but the overall picture leans heavily towards a high-risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
