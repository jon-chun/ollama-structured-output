    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female. Age-wise, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might not have as much stability. But being female could be a lower risk factor since statistically, males tend to have higher crime rates.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism. Even one conviction shows she's had run-ins with the law before.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145'4\" and 125-149 lbs\u2014probably don't play a significant role in risk assessment unless we're considering specific crimes where body type matters, but generally, it's less relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate instability or isolation, which might be a risk factor if she doesn't have strong social support. On the other hand, not being married at 21 isn't unusual, so maybe that's neutral.\n\nEducationally, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides stability and opportunities. So this might be a protective factor against high risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which can lead to financial stress and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a means to cope. High job turnover is a concerning sign.\n\nDrug use is a big one. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it's linked to higher rates of reoffending, especially if she hasn't sought treatment or isn't in recovery. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean she's mentally stable now, but that doesn't negate the drug use impact.\n\nHer upbringing: lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, which could be a risk factor. However, living with both biological parents is usually a protective factor, so this might balance out a bit.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and support systems, potentially lowering the risk of recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: she's young, has a prior conviction, unstable employment history, drug use, but also has education going for her and religious beliefs. The job instability and drug use are strong indicators that could lead to high risk. However, her current mental state (not feeling depressed) and being in college might mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because the prior conviction, recent drug use, and job instability are significant factors. But I'm not 100% confident because education and religious beliefs might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
