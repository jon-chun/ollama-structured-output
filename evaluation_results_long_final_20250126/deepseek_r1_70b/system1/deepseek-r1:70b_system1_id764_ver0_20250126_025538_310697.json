    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. The individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future behavior.\n\nHe's quite tall and heavy\u20146 feet 2 inches and 210 lbs. While physical size alone isn't a direct indicator of risk, it might contribute to potential aggression or intimidation in certain contexts. However, this factor is more neutral unless combined with aggressive tendencies.\n\nHis marital status is single, never married, which can be a risk factor as it sometimes correlates with instability or lack of strong social bonds. Living alone might indicate limited social support, but he's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idleness, which are factors that can lower recidivism risks.\n\nHe held one job during the past year. Employment history is important; steady employment can reduce criminal behavior risk by providing income and stability. However, having only one job might suggest some instability or short-term employment, but without more details, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nDrug use is a red flag. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can impair judgment and increase impulsivity. The presence of both marijuana and cocaine suggests maybe a higher level of substance involvement.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior. However, the absence of recent depression doesn't rule out other mental health concerns or personality traits that might elevate risk.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in an urban area, household size of two. Growing up in a small household with only one parent could have its challenges, but living with a biological parent is generally more stable than foster care or multiple changes. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which might increase risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or community ties, which are sometimes protective factors against recidivism. Without such support, individuals might feel less integrated into their communities, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction is the strongest indicator here. Drug use adds to the risk. Living alone and single status along with limited job history are moderate risks. The lack of religious influence and urban upbringing also nudge the assessment towards higher risk. However, enrollment in school is a mitigating factor that might lower his overall risk compared to someone not engaged in education.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. High risk would typically involve multiple significant indicators like prior convictions, substance abuse, unemployment, etc. Here, he has some positive aspects (school enrollment) but several concerning ones (conviction, drug use). Considering the balance, it leans towards high risk, but perhaps not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
