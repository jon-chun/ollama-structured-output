    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors step by step. The individual is a 22-year-old male with one arrest but no convictions. His age could be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's unemployed and hasn't completed high school, which can limit his opportunities and potentially lead to criminal behavior as an alternative. Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, possibly indicating issues with maintaining employment, which is another risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, raises concerns about substance abuse. Recent drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. His mental state is also a concern; feeling down for most of the past month could indicate depression, which if untreated, might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a small household doesn't immediately raise flags, but not believing in God might reduce social support from religious communities, which can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and mental health issues are significant risk factors. However, the absence of prior convictions is a positive sign. Weighing these factors, I'd say there's a moderate to high risk, maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
