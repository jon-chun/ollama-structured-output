    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The person in question is a 22-year-old Black male with several risk factors that could indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested seven times and has convictions. That's a significant number of arrests at a young age, suggesting a pattern of behavior that's concerning. The more prior offenses someone has, the higher their likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis education level is another red flag. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it can limit job opportunities and increase frustration or desperation.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year, which points to unemployment. Unemployment is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can lead to financial instability and idle time, increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nSubstance use is another factor here. He's used marijuana in the past four years, and while it's not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, potentially leading to risky behaviors.\n\nHis mental health is a concern too. He's felt down and unable to be cheered up for periods during the past month. Depression or low mood can contribute to poor decision-making and may increase the risk of self-destructive or criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nLiving alone and never being married might indicate a lack of strong social support, which is crucial for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. Without a stable support system, individuals are more likely to reoffend.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. While urban environments can have higher crime rates, the family structure here seems relatively stable compared to other risk factors, so this might not weigh as heavily but still contributes to the overall picture.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate a lack of spiritual support or coping mechanisms, which some studies suggest can be protective against recidivism. However, this is less directly tied to criminal behavior compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple prior arrests, lack of education, unemployment, substance use, mental health issues, and limited social support all point towards a high risk. Each of these factors individually contributes to an increased likelihood of negative outcomes, and collectively they compound each other. Therefore, my prediction is that this individual is at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
