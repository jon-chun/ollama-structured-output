    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can be relevant because younger males are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, race alone isn't typically a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests indicate prior involvement with the law, and having a conviction shows that at least one of those arrests led to a guilty verdict. This history suggests some level of criminal behavior and could point to a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis physical stature is 6 feet tall and 180 lbs, which is average to slightly above average for a male. Physical size isn't typically a strong predictor of recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes like assault, but without more context, I won't weigh this heavily.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; being unmarried might indicate less social support or stable relationships, which could be a risk factor. Living alone might suggest limited supervision or support systems.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities and increase idleness, which can be a risk.\n\nHe's held seven jobs in the past year. Job instability is a red flag. Frequent job changes could indicate poor work habits, impulsivity, or inability to maintain employment, all of which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some in the last month. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can impair judgment and decision-making.\n\nHe reported feeling down recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or criminal behaviors, particularly if untreated.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area with five people. Growing up in a stable family with both parents is generally a protective factor against delinquency. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with both parents could mitigate some risks.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower levels of social control, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, though this effect is less direct than other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, prior convictions, job instability, substance abuse, and mental health issues are strong indicators. The stable family background might reduce risk slightly, but the overall picture leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 7 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
