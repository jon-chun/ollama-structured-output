    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: The individual is an 18-year-old male. Young males are generally considered a higher risk group due to impulsivity and peer influence.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: He has been arrested twice and convicted once, which suggests prior involvement with the law, indicating some level of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: 5'5\" and 130 lbs. Physical size isn't a strong indicator unless related to specific crimes, but it's not a major factor here.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married and living alone could indicate social isolation or lack of stable family support, which might increase risk.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: No high school diploma or GED and not in college, plus holding only two jobs in the past year. Limited education and unstable employment can be associated with higher recidivism as they affect opportunities and stability.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Recent marijuana use could indicate substance abuse issues, which are linked to increased risk of criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Felt down recently; while not a diagnosis, it points to possible mental health struggles that can contribute to risk if untreated.\n\n8. **Upbringing**: Lived with both biological parents in an urban household of 9. Large family size might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, potentially contributing to behavioral issues.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God influences personal events, which could be a protective factor as religion can provide support and reduce risk.\n\nConsidering these factors together: young age, prior convictions, substance use, unstable employment, and living situation all point towards higher risk. However, religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence is moderate because while there are several concerning factors, the presence of religion could lower the overall risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
