    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze these risk factors step by step to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher impulsivity, but being 22 isn't extremely young. His race doesn't inherently indicate risk, so I'll note that but not weigh it heavily.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are significant indicators of criminal history. Two arrests and a conviction suggest some level of involvement with the law, which could point to a higher risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145 feet 10 inches and 170 lbs\u2014are within average range for his age and sex, so I don't see this as a contributing factor either way.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; being unmarried might suggest less social integration, but living alone could mean independence or isolation, depending on context. Not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior as it provides opportunities and structure. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities, which might lower risk.\n\nHe held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which can be a risk factor if it leads to financial instability or frustration. However, frequent job changes at a young age aren't uncommon as people explore careers.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so his abstinence is a protective factor.\n\nHe's felt down emotionally some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk if they lead to impulsivity or poor decision-making. However, feeling down occasionally isn't necessarily indicative of severe mental illness unless it's persistent and severe.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor against delinquency. Growing up in an urban area might have different dynamics compared to rural areas, but without more context on neighborhood safety or socioeconomic status, it's hard to assess risk from this alone.\n\nHe believes God has influence over his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community support, which are protective against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: His criminal history (two arrests, one conviction) is the most concerning factor. However, he's engaged in education and hasn't used drugs recently, which are positive signs. Employment instability might be a concern but not definitive. His mental health status isn't severe enough based on the info given. Overall, while there's some risk due to his criminal history, the presence of protective factors like education and stable upbringing suggests the risk isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
