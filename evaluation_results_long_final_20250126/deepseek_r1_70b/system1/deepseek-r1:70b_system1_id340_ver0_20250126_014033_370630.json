    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which might mean he doesn't have a criminal history beyond that arrest.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 165 lbs. That's on the leaner side for his height, but I don't think body size directly relates to risk here. He's never married and lives alone, which could indicate some isolation or less social support, but it's not a strong indicator by itself.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college, which is positive because education can lower recidivism risk. Having held three jobs in a year might show instability, but it could also mean he's exploring options or had temporary work, so it's a bit of a neutral point.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive factor; substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. Feeling down sometimes in the past month isn't severe enough to indicate serious mental health issues unless it's persistent or accompanied by other symptoms.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, which is a stable family background, reducing risk factors. Believing that God influences his life might provide emotional support and reduce risky behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: arrest without conviction, positive education and employment status, stable upbringing, no drug use, and religious beliefs are protective factors. The only potential negatives are living alone and recent feelings of sadness, but they're not significant enough to override the positives. So, overall, the risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
