    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let's start by breaking down each factor.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be indicators, but without other context, they don't necessarily point to high risk on their own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but it's not a strong predictor of future behavior since he hasn't been found guilty yet.\n\nHis physical stature is 5 feet 8 inches and 155 lbs, which is average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate independence or isolation, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless combined with other factors like unemployment or substance abuse.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is a protective factor; having a diploma is positive, though not attending college might limit opportunities, which can sometimes lead to higher risk if other factors are present.\n\nEmployment-wise, he's held two jobs in the past year. This shows some stability but could also indicate instability or job hopping, which might be a minor concern.\n\nSubstance use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some in the last month. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can lead to impaired judgment and engagement in risky activities.\n\nHe reported feeling down at times during the past month. Mental health issues, especially untreated ones, can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, though this seems mild here.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up with two parents is generally a protective factor, but living in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or influences.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social bonds, which are important for desistence from crime.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of drug use and some mental health issues are concerning. However, factors like having a high school diploma, stable living situation (even alone), and family background are positive. The arrest without conviction is a point to note but not definitive. The overall profile doesn't strongly indicate a high risk; more factors would be needed for that assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
