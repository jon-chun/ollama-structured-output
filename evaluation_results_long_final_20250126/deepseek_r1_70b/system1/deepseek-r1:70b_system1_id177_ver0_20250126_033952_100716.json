    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the provided factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old Black male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate a lower risk since it hasn't led to a formal judgment yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall, which is average height, so that probably isn't a significant factor here. He's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could suggest independence or perhaps some isolation, but not necessarily a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as it shows engagement and structure. However, he hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, especially if it leads to financial instability, but since he's in school, it might be intentional.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is often linked to higher criminal behavior, so his abstinence is a good sign. He has felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health can be a risk factor if left untreated, but feeling down doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own.\n\nHis background includes living with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but stable family structure (living with mom) is a protective factor. Believing that God influences personal events could suggest a support system or positive coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest without conviction, enrollment in school, no drug use, and stable upbringing are positives. The recent feelings of depression might be concerning but aren't enough on their own to indicate high risk. Unemployment is a neutral factor given his student status. Overall, the factors lean towards lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
