    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a significant factor; younger individuals might have higher impulsivity and lower life stability, which could increase risk. Gender-wise, females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that's a point towards lower risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction don't necessarily indicate a high risk by themselves, but it does show some involvement with the criminal justice system. It's important to consider the nature of the offense, which isn't provided here, but generally, having any conviction is a risk factor.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145 feet 9 inches and 135 lbs\u2014don't directly relate to recidivism or risk assessment, so I can set those aside as neutral factors.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone at a young age could indicate instability or lack of social support, which might increase risk. Marriage and cohabitation are sometimes associated with lower recidivism because they provide stability and social bonds.\n\nEducationally, she has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive as it provides basic education, but not pursuing further education might limit her opportunities, potentially increasing the risk if she struggles to find stable employment.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Job instability is a red flag. Frequent job changes can indicate issues with employability, reliability, or personal stability, all of which are risk factors for recidivism.\n\nSubstance use is a significant factor here. She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is strongly correlated with criminal behavior and recidivism, as it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities to support substance habits.\n\nMental health-wise, she's felt down and uncheerable for some time during the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems are linked to higher risk behaviors and recidivism.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size four at a young age. Household size alone isn't a direct indicator, but larger families can sometimes have more stress or less individual attention, which might contribute to behavioral issues if combined with other factors.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective against recidivism as they provide a sense of purpose and community support, so this is a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: she's young, has a conviction, unstable employment, substance use, possible mental health issues, lives alone, but also has some protective factors like gender and spiritual beliefs. The presence of drug use and job instability are significant risk factors, while her education and belief system might mitigate some risks. Overall, the combination leans towards a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
