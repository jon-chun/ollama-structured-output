    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can be relevant in certain contexts, but without more specifics, these alone don't indicate high risk. Next, he has been arrested eight times and has convictions. Multiple arrests and prior convictions are significant red flags for recidivism and higher risk behavior.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145'7\" and 154 lbs\u2014are less relevant unless considering escape risks or violence, which isn't indicated here. He's never married and lives alone. Marital status might suggest stability, but living alone could mean fewer support systems, potentially increasing risk factors if isolation contributes to negative behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher recidivism as it limits job opportunities and may lead to criminal activity as an alternative. He's held two jobs in the past year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor for reoffending.\n\nDrug use is a significant concern. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially recent use, can impair judgment and increase likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Mental health issues are also present\u2014he's felt down and uncheerable at times. This could indicate depression or other mental health challenges that, if untreated, might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHis upbringing in a large household (size 7) with his biological mother in an urban area might suggest potential environmental stressors. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, which could contribute to delinquency. His belief in God suggests some form of support or structure, but the impact on risk is mixed; it could be a protective factor if it provides positive guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, convictions, substance use, unstable employment, lack of education, and mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. While his beliefs might offer some stability, the combination of other factors leans heavily towards a higher likelihood of reoffending or posing a risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
