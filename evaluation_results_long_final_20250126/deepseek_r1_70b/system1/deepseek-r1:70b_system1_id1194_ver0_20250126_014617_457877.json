    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 19-year-old Black male. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since it didn't lead to a conviction, maybe it wasn't too serious.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 185 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately suggest any risk factors unless we're considering specific contexts where size matters, which isn't indicated here. Being unmarried and living alone at 19 is pretty common, especially for someone not in college, so that might not be a big factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk because it might limit job opportunities and stability. However, he has held two jobs in the past year, which shows some level of employment, even if it's not consistent or long-term.\n\nNo drug use in the last four years is a positive sign; substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so this lowers his risk. He also hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nGrowing up, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with family could provide stability. His belief that God influences his life might suggest some level of social support or positive outlook, which can be protective against risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: while he lacks education and has an arrest record, the absence of drug use, mental health issues, stable living situation, employment history, and positive beliefs are more indicative of lower risk. The one arrest without conviction isn't enough on its own to mark him as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
