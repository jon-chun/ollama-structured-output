    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on these factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race shouldn't be a determinant here. So maybe his age being young could contribute to higher risk because younger individuals might have less stability.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which definitely points towards a higher risk. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight (5'8\", 165 lbs) don't seem particularly relevant unless we're considering physical strength or something, but I don't think those are major factors here.\n\nHe's never been married and not living alone. Not being married might indicate less social stability or fewer ties to the community, which could be a risk factor. Living situation can affect support systems, so maybe that's a point towards higher risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is often correlated with higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal activity out of necessity or lack of options. That's another point for higher risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could mean he has trouble maintaining employment, which again ties into stability and income, which are factors in recidivism. So that might be a risk factor too.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana is less severe than other drugs, but drug use can still indicate potential issues with substance abuse, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe this isn't as significant.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor if present, but he hasn't felt depressed recently. So that might lower the risk a bit because untreated mental illness is a bigger concern.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, which might contribute to delinquency. Living with a biological parent could provide some stability, but depending on the household environment, it's not clear. Household size of four is average, so maybe that's neutral.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a support system or moral framework that reduces recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are big red flags. Lack of education and job instability also point towards higher risk. Drug use is present but maybe not as severe. Living situation and social factors are mixed\u2014never married, not living alone could be negative, while religious beliefs might be positive. No recent mental health issues is a positive.\n\nSo overall, the high number of arrests and convictions, lack of education, job instability, and some social factors lean towards him being a higher risk. But there's also a belief in religion which might help. I'm thinking the confidence level would be moderate to high, maybe around 70-80%. Since the prediction is YES, indicating high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
