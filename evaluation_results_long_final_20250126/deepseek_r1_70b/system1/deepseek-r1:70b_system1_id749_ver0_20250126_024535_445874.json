    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals are often associated with higher crime rates due to impulsivity. Being male also tends to correlate with higher criminal activity compared to females in many studies.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might mean that the charges were dropped or dismissed, so it's a bit of a mixed signal. It shows he's had some run-in with the law, but without a conviction, maybe the offense wasn't too severe or there was insufficient evidence.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5'11\" and 140 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone are strong indicators unless we're considering specific types of crimes where physical strength is a factor, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor; being unmarried might mean less social integration or support, but living alone at 20 isn't necessarily unusual or indicative of higher risk.\n\nEducational background: he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior as it provides more opportunities and stability. Not being enrolled in college could mean he's working or looking for work, which doesn't inherently increase risk unless there's unemployment involved.\n\nHe held one job during the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing recidivism risk. Having a job suggests some level of responsibility and less time for criminal activities, but holding only one job in a year might indicate instability or short-term employment which could be a minor concern.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to impaired judgment, association with criminal elements, and potential for substance-related crimes like possession or theft to support a habit.\n\nNo recent depression: not feeling depressed recently might lower some risk factors associated with mental health issues that can contribute to criminal behavior. However, the absence of depression doesn't necessarily mean there aren't other mental health concerns.\n\nUpbringing: lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up with two biological parents is usually a protective factor as it often indicates more stable family support. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, but living with both parents could mitigate some of that risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral guidance and community support which can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: while there are some concerning factors like drug use and an arrest, there are also several protective factors such as stable upbringing, employment, education, and religious beliefs. The absence of a conviction and recent depression might lower the overall risk. However, drug use is a significant concern that could elevate the risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
