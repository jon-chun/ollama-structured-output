    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors step by step. The person is a 20-year-old white female with one arrest but no conviction. Her age could be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates. However, the lack of a conviction is a positive sign.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and weighs 180 lbs. While her weight isn't directly a risk factor for criminal behavior, it might relate to health issues or self-esteem, which can sometimes correlate with other behaviors but not necessarily criminal risk.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age could indicate independence, but without more context, it's hard to tie this directly to criminal risk. Her educational background is a high school diploma without college enrollment, which is common for her age group, so maybe not a significant factor here.\n\nShe held 9 jobs in the past year, which suggests instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Job instability can be a risk factor as it might indicate impulsivity or issues with authority, which could relate to higher criminal risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for criminal behavior as it can lead to impaired judgment and engagement in risky activities.\n\nShe's experienced feeling down recently, which indicates possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, especially if coupled with substance abuse.\n\nHer upbringing was stable\u2014living with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior. However, growing up in a larger household might have its own challenges, but this isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nShe believes God influences her personal events, which can be a protective factor as religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism rates by providing a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting it all together: the job instability and drug use are concerning. However, the absence of convictions, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are mitigating factors. Her age might lean towards higher risk but combined with other positives, it's not overwhelming. The mental health aspect is a concern but without more details on severity or treatment, it's hard to weigh heavily.\n\nI think these factors don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. So the prediction would be NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
