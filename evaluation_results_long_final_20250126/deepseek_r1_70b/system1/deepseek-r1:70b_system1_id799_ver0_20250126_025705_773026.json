    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors; young males are often associated with higher crime rates, but I need to see how this interacts with other variables.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests indicate prior involvement with the law, which is a red flag for recidivism. The fact that he was convicted suggests that at least one of those arrests led to a guilty verdict, indicating some culpability.\n\nHis height and weight (5'7\", 135 lbs) are average and not particularly relevant unless considering physicality in crimes, but without specifics on the nature of his offenses, this might not be a significant factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; single individuals living alone might have less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities, potentially reducing criminal behavior.\n\nHe held one job during the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing influence, but holding only one job might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase risk if it leads to financial stress.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some drug use in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe reported feeling down at times during the past month, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nHis upbringing: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environments are protective against crime, so this might be a positive factor unless other issues arose.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which could provide emotional support and reduce risk, as religious engagement is sometimes linked to lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of prior arrests and convictions, drug use, potential mental health issues, and unstable employment are concerning. However, his educational enrollment and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The overall assessment leans towards a moderate risk, so I would predict high risk with around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
