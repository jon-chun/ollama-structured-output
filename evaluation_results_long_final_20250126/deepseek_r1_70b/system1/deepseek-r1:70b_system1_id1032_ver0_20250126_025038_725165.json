    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 22 years old. Younger individuals might be at higher risk because of potential impulsivity and lack of life experience. However, not all young people are high risk, so this is a moderate factor.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race. I don't think race itself is a direct indicator; it's more about systemic factors or biases, which aren't directly relevant here without additional context.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests that she might have been involved in a minor offense or there wasn't enough evidence to convict her. This could indicate some level of risk, but since there was no conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'6\" and 124 lbs. These don't really relate to criminal behavior, so I can disregard this factor.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships and family support usually act as protective factors against criminal behavior. This likely reduces her risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities and increase frustration, but she's married and living with her spouse, which might provide some stability.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor as it can lead to financial instability or boredom, which in turn might increase the likelihood of criminal activity. However, being married might mean she has some financial support, mitigating this risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive indicator because substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior. Her abstinence suggests lower risk.\n\nShe felt down and uncheered sometimes in the past month. While mental health issues can increase risk, feeling down occasionally isn't as severe as diagnosed depression or anxiety disorders. It's something to note but not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 when young. This doesn't directly indicate anything unless it relates to overcrowding or neglect, which isn't mentioned here. So this factor is neutral.\n\nShe feels that God has nothing to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social bonds, but it's not a strong predictor by itself. It might mean she doesn't have the support from a religious community, but again, without more context, it's a minor factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like unemployment and lack of education, which could pose moderate risks. However, the absence of drug use, stable marital relationship, and no convictions are strong protective factors. Her mental state is mild, so overall, her risk seems lower than high.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, while there are some moderate risk factors such as unemployment and educational background, these are outweighed by significant protective factors including a stable marriage, absence of drug use, and lack of conviction history.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
