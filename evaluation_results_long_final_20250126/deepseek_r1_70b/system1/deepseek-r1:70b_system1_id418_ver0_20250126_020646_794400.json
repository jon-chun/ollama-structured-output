Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. Age and gender can be factors, but without specific data on how race impacts recidivism here, I'll note it but not weigh it heavily.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest that he was involved in something serious enough to get arrested, but perhaps the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could indicate some level of risk, maybe low to moderate.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and between 125-149 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a strong predictor for recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes like assault, which we don't have info on here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate instability or lack of support systems, which sometimes correlates with higher risk, but being single isn't a direct indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a mild risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is important. Only holding one job might suggest some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can increase recidivism risk if it leads to financial stress.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It's linked to higher probabilities of reoffending, especially if substances were used recently.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk factors when unaddressed. So this might lower his overall risk.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 8 at a young age. Growing up in a large household could mean less individual attention or resources, potentially contributing to behavioral issues later on. However, it's not a direct indicator but adds some context about his background.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be protective against recidivism as they often provide a support system and moral framework, which might lower his risk.\n\nPutting this all together: The significant factors here are the arrest without conviction (some risk), recent drug use (higher risk), employment instability (moderate risk), and living alone (mild risk). However, having a high school diploma, religious beliefs, and no recent depression are protective factors. Drug use is a strong indicator, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk assessment but not extremely high. Confidence might be around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
