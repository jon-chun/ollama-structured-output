    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to assess whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual in question. The person is a 19-year-old female from an American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut background. She's been arrested twice but not convicted yet. She's married and living with her spouse, which could be a stabilizing factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That might indicate limited education, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to fewer opportunities. She held one job during the year, so she has some employment history but maybe not stable.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor here\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Additionally, she's experienced periods where she felt down, which could point to mental health issues like depression. Mental health struggles can sometimes lead to higher risk-taking behavior or recidivism if not addressed.\n\nShe grew up in a rural area with her biological mother in a small household. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a challenge. Her belief in God suggests she has some form of social support or coping mechanism, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: arrests without convictions aren't as severe, but drug use and mental health concerns are red flags. Limited education and employment could contribute to higher risk factors. However, being married and living with a spouse might provide stability that mitigates some risks. Overall, the presence of drug use and mental health issues leans towards a higher risk, so I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
