    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old female. Her age could be a factor since younger individuals might still be developing and could have higher impulsivity, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested seven times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests at such a young age, which suggests a pattern of behavior that could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHer height and weight are 6 feet tall and between 175-199 lbs. While this might give some insight into physical presence, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal risk unless considering specific types of crimes where physicality is a factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but her living situation might indicate limited social support or stability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is often associated with higher recidivism rates because it limits employment opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior out of necessity or lack of alternatives.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment history can be a risk factor as it suggests potential instability in her life, which might contribute to criminal activity if she's struggling financially.\n\nDrug use is a significant red flag. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which indicates substance abuse issues. Drug use is strongly correlated with criminal behavior, both as a direct offense (possession) and indirectly through related activities.\n\nShe's experienced feelings of depression recently, feeling down for parts of the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if untreated. Depression might lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in an urban area, in a household of two. The small household size and urban environment don't necessarily indicate risk on their own unless there were other adverse childhood factors involved, which aren't detailed here.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This could be a protective factor if it provides emotional support or a sense of community, potentially reducing risk factors by offering a positive influence.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: the high number of arrests and convictions at a young age are concerning. Lack of education and unstable employment can contribute to higher recidivism rates. Active drug use is a strong indicator of potential ongoing issues. While her belief in God might be a mitigating factor, the other elements seem to outweigh it.\n\nI'm leaning towards this indicating a high risk because multiple factors point to continued challenges that are associated with criminal behavior and recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
