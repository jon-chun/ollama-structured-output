    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but race shouldn't be a direct indicator of risk. However, systemic issues might play a role, so I'll note that but not weigh it heavily.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant factor because prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism. Each arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending, especially if there was an actual conviction.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145'9\" and 145 lbs\u2014don't really indicate risk unless in specific contexts like violent crimes where size might matter, but without knowing the crime type, I'll consider this neutral.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could suggest a lack of stable social support, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Marriage or cohabitation often provides stability, so his single status might be a concern.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college points to lower educational attainment. Education is a protective factor against recidivism; without it, job prospects are limited, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is another strong risk factor because it leads to financial instability and idle time, both of which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so his abstinence is a good indicator of lower risk in that area.\n\nHe's been feeling down for most of the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if untreated. It impairs judgment and decision-making, possibly leading to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in an urban household of five. Growing up in a large family might not be negative, but urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates and exposure to violence, which could influence behavior.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs often provide moral guidance and support, reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together: prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, living alone, and mental health issues are significant risk factors. However, no drug use and religious belief are protective. The combination leans towards high risk but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
