    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age and gender can be factors; young males are statistically at higher risk for offending.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of delinquency and potential ongoing behavior issues, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight (5'6\", 150-174 lbs) don't seem particularly relevant to criminal risk unless considering physical strength or ability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Being unmarried isn't a big factor, but living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor if he lacks supervision or positive influences.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college points to lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates as it limits job opportunities and social mobility.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate irresponsibility or inability to maintain steady work, which might correlate with criminal behavior if linked to economic necessity or lack of productive engagement.\n\nDrug use (cocaine) in the past four years is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism, as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is a positive note; mental health issues like depression can sometimes increase risk, but the absence here might lower that particular aspect.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. A stable family structure (living with both parents) is generally protective against delinquency, so this might be a lower risk factor unless other issues were present in the home environment.\n\nBelief in God's influence could have mixed effects; some studies suggest religion can be protective by providing moral guidelines and community support, but it depends on how it's integrated into his life.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use are strong indicators of high risk. The presence of a stable family background might mitigate some factors, but the cumulative effect of the other issues likely points to a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
