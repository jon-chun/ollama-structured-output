    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk according to criminal justice standards. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are a strong predictor of future behavior. However, it was only one arrest, so maybe not the highest risk yet.\n\nShe's 21, which is young. Younger individuals might still be in the experimental phase with crime or substances. Her demographics\u2014White, 5'5\", 150-174 lbs\u2014are pretty average and don't particularly stand out as risk factors on their own.\n\nNot being married and living alone could mean less stability, but she's not living alone right now. Maybe she has some support system in place, which is a positive factor. She has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Limited education can sometimes correlate with higher risk if it affects employment opportunities, but she did hold one job this year, so she's employable.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years\u2014is common and generally considered lower risk compared to other substances, but any drug use can indicate potential issues. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism risk.\n\nHer upbringing: lived with her biological mother in a large household (size 6) in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger family might mean less individual attention, potentially increasing risk factors. However, having both biological parents might provide some stability.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life, which could be a protective factor as religious beliefs sometimes correlate with lower recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: one conviction is a red flag, but the other factors aren't strongly indicative of high risk. The presence of stable living conditions and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. So overall, I don't see this as a high-risk case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
