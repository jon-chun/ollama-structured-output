    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or problematic behavior. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can be factors, but they alone don't determine risk. Young males are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors, so that could be a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. A high number of arrests, especially with convictions, suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. Recidivism rates are often higher when someone has multiple prior offenses, so this is a significant risk factor.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145'9\" and 180 lbs\u2014don't inherently indicate risk unless related to specific crimes like assault, but without more context, I won't weigh this heavily.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes correlate with stability; being unmarried might suggest less social support, which could increase risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHaving a GED and not enrolled in college: Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates as it may limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability. However, having a GED shows some level of educational achievement, so this might be a moderate factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism. Lack of stable employment can lead to financial desperation, increasing the likelihood of illegal activities.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine: Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Drugs can impair judgment and increase impulsivity. Recent use (some times in the past month) adds to the concern as it indicates ongoing issues.\n\nFeeling down and unable to be cheered up some of the time in the past month suggests possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of criminal behavior, especially if linked to substance abuse as a form of self-medication.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults at a young age: This could indicate instability in his upbringing, which is linked to higher behavioral issues and recidivism. Foster care or unstable living conditions are known risk factors.\n\nLiving in an urban area might have higher crime rates, but it's more about environment than individual risk. However, urban environments can expose individuals to more criminal opportunities and peer influences.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events: Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a support system or moral framework. It depends on how he uses these beliefs\u2014if they promote positive behavior, it might reduce risk, but if he feels fatalistic, it could increase risk by diminishing his sense of control over his actions.\n\nPutting this all together: High arrest and conviction history, unemployment, recent drug use, possible mental health issues, and unstable upbringing are strong indicators. While some factors like education level and religious beliefs might have a moderating effect, the overall picture leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
