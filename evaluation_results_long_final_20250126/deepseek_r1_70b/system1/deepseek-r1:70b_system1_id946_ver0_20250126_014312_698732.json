    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does increase the risk because it shows she's had legal trouble before.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 214 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics alone are strong indicators of criminal behavior unless related to specific crimes, which isn't indicated here. She's separated and living alone. Marital status might have some impact on social support, but being separated doesn't directly correlate with high risk.\n\nShe has a GED certificate and isn't in college. Lower education can sometimes be linked to higher crime rates, but having a GED shows she made an effort to complete her education. Not being enrolled in college isn't necessarily a negative factor by itself.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might indicate instability or lack of resources, which could lead to criminal activity out of necessity or opportunity.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a stronger indicator of high risk than past use, so this reduces her risk profile.\n\nShe sometimes felt down recently, but not enough to be classified as clinically depressed unless it's severe. Feeling down can affect behavior, but without more information on severity or duration, it's hard to assess its impact on criminal risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults at a young age in a large household could indicate instability or neglect, which might increase risk factors for behavioral issues later in life.\n\nShe believes God influences her personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce risky behavior, so this might be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction and unemployment are concerning, but lack of recent drug use, stable living situation (alone), and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards moderate risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 9. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
