    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user wants me to analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. I need to respond only with a specific JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the individual: she's a 21-year-old female, White, arrested once but not convicted. Arrest without conviction might suggest that the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe's physically average\u20145'6\", 160 lbs. That doesn't particularly indicate risk one way or another. Her living situation is alone, which could mean independence, but also might hint at social isolation if taken in context with other factors.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't in college. This is pretty standard and not inherently risky. Employment history shows she's had two jobs in the past year, which could indicate stability or possible instability depending on the reasons for job changes, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive indicator. Recent feelings of being down could suggest mental health issues, but she hasn't used drugs, so that's a good sign. She grew up with both biological parents in a rural area, which might provide stability. Her belief in God suggests some form of support system or coping mechanism.\n\nPutting it all together: no convictions, stable upbringing, no drug use, employed. The only red flag is her recent feelings of depression, but without more severe indicators like substance abuse or violent history, the overall risk seems low. So, I'd predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
