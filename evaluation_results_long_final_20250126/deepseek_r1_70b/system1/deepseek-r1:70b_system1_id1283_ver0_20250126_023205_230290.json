    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the age is 20. Younger individuals are often considered higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. But 20 isn't extremely young; it's on the lower end but not a teenager anymore.\n\nHe's been arrested 8 times and has convictions. That's significant. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. The number alone is a red flag because it shows repeated interactions with the law, which might point to ongoing issues or a disregard for legal boundaries.\n\nHis height and weight are average\u20145'6\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to risk assessment unless considering physical strength, but that's probably not a major factor here compared to other elements.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor. Not being married might mean less social support or stability in his life, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. A GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities and could correlate with unemployment or underemployment. Lack of steady employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a stable income source, individuals might turn to illegal activities out of necessity or due to idle time. This is a significant point that leans towards higher risk.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is legal in some places and generally considered less harmful than other drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase impulsivity. However, since it's only marijuana, the impact might be lower compared to harder drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues are a risk factor, but the absence here is positive. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed doesn't necessarily mean he has no mental health issues; it just means he's not currently experiencing depression.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area of household size 3. Growing up in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or more challenging socio-economic conditions, which can be risk factors. Household size isn't directly a major factor unless it indicates overcrowding or instability, but three people is manageable.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support and different coping mechanisms. However, this isn't as strong a predictor as other factors like employment status or criminal history.\n\nPutting all these together: the multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. Young age, unemployment, living alone without a strong support system, and drug use also contribute to a higher risk profile. The lack of recent depression is a slight positive, but it's outweighed by the negatives.\n\nI'd say this individual has several high-risk factors, so the prediction should be \"YES.\" As for confidence, considering all these points, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
