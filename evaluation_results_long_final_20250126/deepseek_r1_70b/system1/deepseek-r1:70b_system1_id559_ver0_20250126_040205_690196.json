    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal recidivism or other negative outcomes. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor since younger offenders are sometimes considered higher risk due to impulsivity. However, being White doesn't inherently indicate risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. This indicates some level of criminal history, which is a known predictor of recidivism. More arrests and convictions usually correlate with higher risk.\n\nHis height and weight (6'1\", 215 lbs) might not directly relate to criminal behavior unless considering potential for violence or intimidation, but that's speculative.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can be a protective factor; being unmarried might suggest less stability or support, which could increase risk slightly.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive as it indicates some level of education, but not being in college means he might not have higher education to reduce recidivism risk.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing recidivism risk. However, having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana in the past four years and recent use could indicate substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe sometimes feels down, which suggests possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental illness can increase risk of criminal behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of seven might indicate a stressful or unstable home environment, which can be a risk factor for delinquency.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events could be a protective factor if it provides moral guidance and support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting this all together: his criminal history is concerning. Drug use and mental health issues add to the risk. However, having a high school diploma and employment are positive factors that might lower the risk. The presence of potential protective factors like religion might mitigate some risks. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. So, prediction would be \"YES\" with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
