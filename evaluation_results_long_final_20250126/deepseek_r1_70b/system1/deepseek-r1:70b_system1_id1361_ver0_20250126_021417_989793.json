    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for criminal behavior. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19 years old. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because of impulsivity and lack of life experience. That might contribute to higher risk.\n\nNext, gender and race: being male is often associated with higher crime rates statistically, though I should be cautious not to stereotype. His race doesn't inherently indicate risk but could relate to systemic factors like discrimination or socioeconomic status, which can influence criminal involvement.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might mean he's had run-ins with the law but hasn't been found guilty. This could indicate a higher likelihood of future offenses since he's already in contact with the justice system multiple times.\n\nHis physical characteristics (5'8\", 170 lbs) don't particularly stand out as risk factors unless in specific contexts like certain crimes requiring strength, but generally, this is neutral.\n\nNot being married and living alone at 19 could suggest instability or isolation. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college points to lower educational attainment. This can be a risk factor as education often provides structure, skills, and opportunities that reduce criminal involvement. Unemployment for the past year is another red flag\u2014without a steady job, individuals might turn to crime out of necessity or boredom.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, over the past four years and in the last month. While marijuana is less severe than other drugs, chronic use can impair judgment and decision-making, potentially leading to higher risk behaviors. Also, feeling down for most of the past month suggests possible depression. Mental health issues can increase criminal behavior if untreated, especially if linked to substance abuse.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area as a child. Large family size might indicate resource strain or less individual attention, which could contribute to behavioral issues. Urban environments are often associated with higher crime rates due to factors like poverty and exposure to violence.\n\nBelief that God influences personal events. Spirituality can be protective, offering moral guidance and community support, which might reduce risk. However, if this belief system is distorted or used to justify actions, it could have the opposite effect, though that's less common.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, multiple arrests, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, mental health issues\u2014these are strong indicators for higher risk. The living situation and spirituality might be neutral or slightly protective but not enough to outweigh the other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
