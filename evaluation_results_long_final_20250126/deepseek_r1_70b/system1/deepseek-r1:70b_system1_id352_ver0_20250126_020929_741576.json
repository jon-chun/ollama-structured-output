    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a young male, which is often associated with higher crime rates, but age alone isn't the only indicator. He's been arrested twice and convicted once, so that's a point towards higher risk because prior convictions can indicate a tendency to reoffend. \n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs, which might give him an intimidating presence, but physical size doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. I shouldn't put too much weight on that.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support or supervision, which sometimes is linked to higher risk, but it's not a strong indicator by itself. Unmarried status at 22 isn't unusual these days either.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities, so this might lower his risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk as it provides structure and income, but only having one job could mean instability or short-term employment, which isn't as protective.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for criminal behavior, so his abstinence is a good sign.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is another positive since mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not managed.\n\nHis living situation as a child with non-biological adults in an urban area of size four might indicate some instability or lack of support in his upbringing. Adverse childhood experiences can increase risk, but the household size being four isn't necessarily negative.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, as religion can provide a sense of community and moral framework, but this varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: prior convictions are concerning, but he's got protective factors like education, no drug use, and stable mental health. The lack of strong social ties (living alone) and unstable job history are minor risks, but overall, the positive factors might outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
