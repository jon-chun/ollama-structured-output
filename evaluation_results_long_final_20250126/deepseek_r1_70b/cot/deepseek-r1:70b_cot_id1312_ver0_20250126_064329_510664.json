    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding rearrest recidivism within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a young male, only 21. Youth is often linked with higher impulsivity, which can increase criminal behavior risk. So that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can indicate either a lack of evidence or perhaps first-time offenses. Maybe medium risk here because it shows some involvement in the justice system but not a solid pattern yet.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5'11\" and 158 lbs. That doesn't stand out as particularly unusual, so I don't see this as a significant factor. Low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Social isolation or lack of stable relationships can contribute to higher recidivism. Unmarried status might mean less social support, so medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Lower education often limits job opportunities, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. High risk here because unemployment and poverty are correlated with crime.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism since it leads to financial instability. Definitely high risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can lead to criminal activity to support habits or impair judgment. High risk.\n\nNo recent depression, which might lower some risks, but without mental health issues, this isn't a major factor. Low risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a large household of 11 in a rural area. Large family size might indicate less individual attention, and rural areas sometimes have fewer opportunities or resources. Medium risk because while it's not as bad as an unstable home, the environment could contribute to challenges.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can reduce social support from religious communities, which are often protective. Medium risk since this might limit positive social networks.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: several high-risk elements like youth, education level, unemployment, drug use. Some mediums and lows. Overall, the high factors seem to dominate, so I'd predict a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (young)\", \"high\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history (one arrest, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some involvement but not a clear pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics (5'11\\\", 158 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No significant physical attributes that would increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (never married)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships may contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level (no high school diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lower education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (unemployed for the past year)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism as it leads to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse increases the likelihood of criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (no recent depression)\", \"low\", \"Absence of reported mental health issues reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Family background (large household, rural area)\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household in a rural area may indicate limited resources or support.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs (does not believe God influences personal events)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation can reduce protective social networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
