    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19, which is young. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peer groups.\n\nNext, gender: being male doesn't directly increase risk, but statistically, males do have higher recidivism rates than females, so this is something to note as a potential low risk factor.\n\nEthnicity: he's Hispanic. I don't see ethnicity itself as a direct risk factor unless it's linked to systemic issues like discrimination or socioeconomic status, which aren't detailed here. So maybe this isn't a significant factor on its own.\n\nArrest history: two arrests but no convictions. This could indicate either that he's been in situations where he was at risk, but didn't result in convictions, so the actual risk might be lower than if he had convictions. However, multiple arrests suggest some involvement with the justice system, which is a moderate risk.\n\nPhysical build: average height and weight, nothing here stands out as a risk factor. So this is likely low.\n\nMarital status: married and living with spouse. This could provide stability and support, reducing recidivism risk. Married individuals often have lower rates because of social bonds, so this is a protective factor, lowering the overall risk.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not in college. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit job opportunities, which can be a risk if it leads to unemployment and associated issues. This could be a moderate risk.\n\nEmployment history: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. So this is high risk.\n\nSubstance use: used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as hard drugs, any drug use can indicate potential issues with impulse control or association with risky behaviors. This might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Good mental health is a protective factor, so this would lower his risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environment is positive, but growing up in an urban area can have higher crime exposure, which is a moderate risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God influences personal events. Religion can provide a support system and reduce recidivism by promoting positive behavior, so this is a protective factor, lowering the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk factors are unemployment and young age; moderate risks include arrest history, substance use, urban upbringing; low or protective factors include marital status, education, religion. The presence of both high-risk and protective factors makes me think the overall prediction might be medium confidence for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age (19) is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"While males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, this factor alone does not significantly elevate risk without other contributing factors.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity itself is not a direct indicator of criminal propensity unless compounded by systemic disadvantages, which are not specified here.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests without conviction suggest some involvement in risky behavior but do not confirm a high likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight (5'9\\\", 155 lbs) do not inherently indicate a higher risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of recidivism through social support and accountability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but lack of current enrollment in college may limit future opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"high\", \"Unemployment over the past year increases financial instability and idle time, which are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use indicates potential substance-related issues but is less severe than harder drugs in terms of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental stability and lower likelihood of engaging in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective, but urban residence may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk by promoting positive behavioral choices.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
