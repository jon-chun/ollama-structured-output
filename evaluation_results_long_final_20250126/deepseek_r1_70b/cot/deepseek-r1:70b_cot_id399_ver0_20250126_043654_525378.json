    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is young. Younger individuals are generally at higher risk of recidivism because they might not have stable life structures yet and could be more impulsive. So, I'll mark age as high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily indicate a strong criminal history, so this seems low risk for rearrest.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem to pose any specific risk factors related to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean he lacks a support system or stable environment, which might increase his likelihood of reoffending. I'll consider this medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can be linked to higher recidivism rates. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year, indicating instability in employment. Unstable employment can contribute to higher risk because it might lead to financial stress or involvement in criminal activities. So, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is concerning. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism. This should be high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this isn't a concern here. So, low risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five might mean more people around, potentially offering support, so that's probably not a significant risk factor. I'll mark it as low.\n\nHis belief in God could provide a positive influence and reduce recidivism tendencies, so this is low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors are age and drug use; mediums are living alone, education, employment. The rest are low. Overall, the higher number of medium and one high-risk factor suggests he's at risk for rearrest. I'll predict YES with 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19 years old):** Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to factors like impulsivity and lack of stable life structures. This is considered a high-risk factor.\n\n2. **Arrest History:** Only one arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating a low risk.\n\n3. **Physical Build (5'7\", 125-149 lbs):** No specific correlation with recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\n4. **Living Situation (Living alone):** Living alone at a young age may indicate a lack of support system or stable environment, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. This is a medium risk.\n\n5. **Educational Background:** Lack of high school diploma/GED and not enrolled in college points to limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk. Medium risk.\n\n6. **Employment History (One job in the past year):** Indicates instability, which can lead to financial stress and increased risk of reoffending. Medium risk.\n\n7. **Substance Use:** Past drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, making this a high-risk indicator.\n\n8. **Mental Health (No recent depression):** Current mental health stability reduces recidivism risk, so low risk here.\n\n9. **Family Background (Household size of five):** Larger households may offer more support, thus lower risk. Low risk.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide positive influence and reduce recidivism tendencies, indicating low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** With high-risk factors being age and substance use, alongside several medium-risk factors, the overall assessment leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to impulsivity and lack of stable life structures.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No specific correlation with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system or stable environment.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED and not enrolled in college indicates limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year suggests instability which could lead to financial stress.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risk factors.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Larger household may offer more support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God could provide positive influence.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
