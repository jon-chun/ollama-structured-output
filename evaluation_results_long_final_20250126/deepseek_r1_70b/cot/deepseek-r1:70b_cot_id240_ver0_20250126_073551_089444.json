    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can indicate situations where charges were dropped or dismissed, which might lower the risk compared to someone with a conviction history. So I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis age is 21. Younger individuals, especially in their early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behavior and recidivate. This makes his age a medium risk factor because it's a common indicator for higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's not married and lives with others. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with less stability, but living with family or others might provide support, which could lower the risk. So I'd rate this as low.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive because education often reduces recidivism by providing better job opportunities. However, he isn't enrolled in college and has only held one job in the past year. This employment instability could be a risk factor for recidivism, so I'll mark it medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed now. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, but since he's abstained, this lowers his risk. Similarly, not being depressed reduces the likelihood of impulsive behaviors. Both are low factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child: Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, which might increase recidivism risk. So I'll rate this medium.\n\nBelieving that God has control could indicate religious involvement, which often correlates with lower recidivism due to community support and moral guidance. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium, but the key ones like age and employment instability push the prediction towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. So I'll predict YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide stability and reduce isolation.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year could indicate instability or limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may expose him to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God could provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
