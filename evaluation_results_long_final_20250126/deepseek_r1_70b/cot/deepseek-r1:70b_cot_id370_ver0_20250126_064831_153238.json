    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, his age is 19. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and could be more influenced by peers. That makes me think his age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females. So that's another point towards medium risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't too bad, but it does show some involvement with the justice system. I'm leaning towards low here because it's not a repeat offense yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider that a low factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less stability or support, which might increase risk. But he's also enrolled in college, which suggests some structure. So maybe medium for living situation.\n\nHaving a high school diploma and being in college is positive. Education often reduces recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nHolding two jobs in the past year shows stability and responsibility, pointing to low risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse can significantly increase recidivism chances, especially if it's recent or frequent. So high risk here.\n\nNo depression recently is positive; mental health issues can raise recidivism risk, so this is a low factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents as a child is a protective factor, suggesting a stable upbringing. That's low risk.\n\nBelieving in God might provide emotional support and reduce recidivism, so that's another low factor.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19):** Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsiveness and peer influence. - Medium\n2. **Gender (Male):** Higher recidivism rates among males compared to females. - Medium\n3. **Arrest/Conviction History:** One arrest and conviction indicate some justice system involvement but not extensive. - Low\n4. **Height/Weight:** No direct correlation with recidivism. - Low\n5. **Living Situation (Alone):** May suggest less support, could slightly increase risk. - Medium\n6. **Education/Employment:** Employed and enrolled in college indicates stability and lower risk. - Low\n7. **Drug Use:** Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism risk. - High\n8. **Mental Health (No Depression):** Lack of recent issues reduces risk. - Low\n9. **Family Background:** Stable upbringing with both parents is protective. - Low\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide support, reducing recidivism likelihood. - Low\n\nConsidering these factors, the individual has a mix of low, medium, and one high-risk factor (drug use). Despite some positive factors like education and employment, the drug use is significant enough to lean towards a higher risk.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsiveness and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Arrest/Conviction History\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction suggest some involvement but not extensive criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support or stability, which could increase recidivism risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Education/Employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant predictor of higher recidivism risk due to potential substance dependency and related behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the likelihood of mental health-related recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age indicates a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
