    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 20. Younger offenders tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be influenced more by peers. So that seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, his criminal history shows 8 arrests and convictions. That's significant. More prior offenses are strongly linked to higher recidivism. So this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's male, which statistically is associated with higher crime rates compared to females. That's another point towards higher risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't particularly stand out as risk factors. They might influence certain types of crimes, but generally, they aren't strong predictors. I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone and never married could indicate a lack of stable social support structures, which can increase recidivism risk. So medium here.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one, but not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities. Education can reduce recidivism, so maybe medium.\n\nUnemployed for the past year\u2014unemployment is a known risk factor because it can lead to poverty and criminal activity as a means of survival. High risk.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as hard drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk. Medium.\n\nNo recent depression, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this might lower his risk a bit.\n\nLiving with biological mother in an urban area at a young age\u2014urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, but living with family could be stabilizing. Maybe medium.\n\nDoesn't believe God has anything to do with him personally\u2014I've read that religious beliefs can sometimes reduce recidivism by providing a support network or moral framework. So lack of belief might slightly increase risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll go with low.\n\nPutting all together: several high-risk factors like age, criminal history, unemployment, gender. Some mediums and lows. Overall, this adds up to a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Eight prior arrests and convictions indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offending.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females, though this factor alone isn't as influential as others.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight are not strong predictors of criminal behavior or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor as it can lead to financial instability and increased criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe than other drugs, can still impair judgment and contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental stability, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological parent in an urban setting may have mixed effects; while family support is positive, urban environments can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious belief may reduce access to certain support networks but isn't a strong predictor on its own.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
