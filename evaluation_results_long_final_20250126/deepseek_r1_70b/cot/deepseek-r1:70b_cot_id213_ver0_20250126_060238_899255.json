    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 22, which is young. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have stable life structures yet.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to females, so that's another point towards medium risk.\n\nHe has two prior arrests without convictions. While convictions are a stronger indicator, two arrests still suggest some involvement in criminal activity, which I'd rate as medium.\n\nHis height and weight don't particularly stand out as risk factors, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone could indicate less stable social support, but it's not a strong factor on its own, so maybe low.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a significant factor because education often provides stability and opportunities. Lack of education can lead to higher recidivism, so I'd say medium.\n\nUnemployment is a big risk factor. No jobs in the past year suggests instability and potential desperation, leading me to rate that as high.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over four years, is concerning but not as severe as harder drugs. Still, it's a moderate indicator, so medium.\n\nNo recent depression is positive, reducing mental health risks, so low.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a small household might provide some stability, but without more info on family dynamics, I'll consider it low.\n\nBelief in God can be a protective factor, offering moral guidance and community support. So that's also low.\n\nPutting this all together: age (medium), gender (medium), arrests (medium), education (medium), unemployment (high). These factors lean towards a higher risk. Despite some protective factors like living situation and religious beliefs, the overall indicators point to a medium-high risk. I think there's about an 85% confidence he might reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young and associated with higher recidivism rates as individuals may not yet have stable life circumstances.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is statistically associated with higher recidivism rates compared to female.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests without conviction indicate some involvement in criminal activity, though not as severe as convictions.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No specific risk associated with height and weight in this context.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support but is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year indicates instability and potential increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological dad in a small household suggests some stability but without more details, it's a low factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
