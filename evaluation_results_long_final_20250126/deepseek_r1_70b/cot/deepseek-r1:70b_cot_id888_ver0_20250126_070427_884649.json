    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So that leans towards high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction indicates some level of criminal history, but it's only one time, which isn't too severe. That seems medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't really indicate much about his likelihood to reoffend, so I'll consider that low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase the chance of recidivism. Not being married also removes a stabilizing influence. So that's probably high risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is a big factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher crime rates due to unemployment. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHe held two jobs in the past year, which shows some stability but isn't consistent enough. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nNot using drugs for four years is positive, so that should be low risk.\n\nFeeling down recently could indicate mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if not addressed. So that's medium risk.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in an urban area might have exposed him to higher crime environments, which is a risk factor. Medium risk again.\n\nBelieving in God could provide some positive influence and support, so that might lower the risk, making it low.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm thinking there's a moderate risk overall, but the factors lean towards a prediction of YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism due to less life experience and potentially poorer decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history, but it is not extensive enough to be considered high risk yet.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build (5'5\\\", 145 lbs) does not significantly correlate with recidivism risk and can be considered low impact.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone and never being married may indicate a lack of stable social support, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_employment_history\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED and holding only two jobs in the past year suggests instability and limited opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk associated with substance abuse-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps some of the time could indicate mental health issues that, if unaddressed, might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a biological mother in a household of size 4 is not inherently high risk but may indicate some environmental challenges.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with personal events can provide a stabilizing influence and potentially reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
