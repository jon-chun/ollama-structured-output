    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict if they'll be rearrested within three years. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet and could still be influenced by peers or other factors. So I think age would be a medium risk here.\n\nNext, he's been arrested eight times and has convictions. That's quite a high number, especially for someone so young. Prior criminal history is a strong indicator of recidivism, so this should definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to me in terms of criminal behavior, so I can consider that as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability; being single might mean less social support or more freedom to engage in risky behaviors. So I'd rate this a medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a significant factor. Lack of education often limits job opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of criminal activity out of necessity or due to fewer prospects. This should be high risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year but isn't currently enrolled in college. Unstable employment could mean he's struggling financially, which might lead him back to crime. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some employment history but also instability.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and recent use is concerning. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. This should be high risk.\n\nFeeling down lately could indicate mental health issues, which if left untreated, might contribute to criminal behavior. However, it's a single factor, so I'll consider it medium risk.\n\nLiving in a large household in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, but without more specifics on family dynamics, I'm not sure how much this contributes. Maybe low risk here.\n\nBelieving that God has a role in his life could be a protective factor if it provides moral guidance or support. So this might lower his recidivism risk, making it a low risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: he has several high-risk factors like prior convictions and drug use, which are strong predictors. But he also has some medium risks that add up. However, the belief in God could be a positive influence. Overall, I think he's likely to reoffend because of the multiple high-risk factors outweighing the few protective ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Eight arrests and convictions indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight are not directly indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with less social support or stability, which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs indicates some stability but may also suggest inconsistent employment, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Childhood)\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a large household does not strongly correlate with recidivism without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
