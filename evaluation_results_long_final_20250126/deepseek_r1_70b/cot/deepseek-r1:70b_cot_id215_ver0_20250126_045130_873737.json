    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old female who's been arrested twice and convicted once. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is relatively young. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet or stable life structures.\n\nShe's female. I remember that males typically have higher recidivism rates than females, so being female could lower her risk.\n\nShe has two arrests and one conviction. That's a significant point. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. However, she's only been convicted once, which might mean the other arrest didn't lead to a conviction, possibly because of plea deals or dismissal.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so I don't think that factors in much here unless we're considering physicality related to certain crimes, but with no info on crime type, it's probably not relevant.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Being unmarried at 19 is common, but living with others might provide some stability, which could lower her risk. However, if she's living in a household where others have criminal histories or negative influences, that could increase risk, but there's no info on that here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled in further education might limit her future prospects, which could be a risk factor if she doesn't have stable employment or other support structures.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might suggest higher risk because unemployment is linked to recidivism. On the flip side, having multiple jobs could also show that she's actively seeking work, so it depends on the context.\n\nDrug use is a big one here\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism. Drugs can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior, either directly or through associations with criminal circles.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower her risk compared to someone struggling with mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism if untreated, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that might be a positive factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five at a young age. Larger households might have more resources or more chaos depending on the dynamics. Without specifics on family structure or support, it's hard to say, but overcrowding can sometimes lead to neglect or stress, which could increase risk factors.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lower religious involvement is sometimes associated with higher recidivism because religion can provide a support network and moral framework. However, this varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: Young age and drug use are high-risk factors. Employment instability and criminal history (two arrests) also lean towards medium risk each. Her gender being female lowers the risk, as does having a high school diploma. Living situation is neutral without more info, mental health status is positive, and religious views might slightly increase risk.\n\nSo, the risk factors I'd highlight are age, drug use, criminal history, employment stability, education, living situation, mental health, household size, gender, and religion. Assigning weights: high for age and drugs, medium for criminal history and employment, low for others.\n\nOverall prediction is YES for recidivism because the higher factors like young age and drug use are significant predictors. Confidence is around 75% because while several factors point to a higher risk, there are mitigating elements like being female and having a diploma.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can lead to impaired judgment and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in the past year could indicate instability, which is linked to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
