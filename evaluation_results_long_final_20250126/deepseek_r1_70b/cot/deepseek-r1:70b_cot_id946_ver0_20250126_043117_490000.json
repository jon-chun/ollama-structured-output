    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old woman who has been arrested once, convicted, and predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 22. Younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they have more time ahead and might not have as stable lives. But 22 is on the lower end for adults, so maybe medium?\n\nGender isn't a major factor here; being female doesn't significantly increase or decrease recidivism risk much.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. First-time offenders usually have lower recidivism rates than those with multiple offenses, but since she was convicted, it shows the offense was serious enough. I think this might be medium risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 214 lbs. Weight could indicate health issues or inactivity, which might relate to mental health or social withdrawal. But without more context, maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's separated and living alone. Separated at 22 is unusual; perhaps indicates relationship instability or family issues. Living alone might mean less support system, so medium risk.\n\nEducational background: GED certificate but not in college. Having a GED is better than nothing, but not pursuing further education could limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability. Maybe medium.\n\nEmployment history: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to poverty and criminal activity as a means of survival. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in four years. That's good; reduces recidivism risk, so low.\n\nMental health: felt down recently but not consistently. Indicates possible depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated. Maybe medium.\n\nLiving situation as a child: lived with non-biological adults in a large household. This could indicate instability or neglect, which are risk factors for criminal behavior later. High risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: she believes God influences her life. Religion can be a protective factor, providing support and reducing recidivism. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAge: medium\nGender: low (but not in the list)\nArrest/conviction: medium\nHeight/weight: low\nLiving situation: medium\nEducation: medium\nEmployment: high\nDrug use: low\nMental health: medium\nChildhood living: high\nReligious beliefs: low\n\nNow, considering all these factors. High risks are employment and childhood living. Mediums include age, arrest history, living alone, education, mental health. Lows are weight, drug use, religion.\n\nSince employment is a major factor, and she's young with some instability in her past, the overall prediction might lean towards higher risk. But she has no recent drug use and religious support, which are positives.\n\nI think the confidence would be moderate because while there are high-risk factors like unemployment and unstable upbringing, she also has protective factors. So maybe 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, she is a young adult, which places her in a medium risk category as younger individuals are more prone to impulsive behavior but have their entire lives ahead of them.\"),\n    (\"arrest_and_conviction_history\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates some criminal history, but it's limited, so this factor is low.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Her height and weight do not directly correlate with a higher risk of recidivism, thus considered low.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Being separated at a young age and living alone could indicate instability or lack of support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities, posing a medium risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year significantly increases recidivism risk due to potential financial instability and lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor to low.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate ongoing mental health issues, increasing the risk moderately if untreated.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological adults in a large household suggests instability, which is a high-risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
