    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peer groups. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has one conviction. Two arrests in a short time could indicate a pattern, but it's not an extensive history yet. Maybe medium risk here too.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so low risk.\n\nLiving alone might mean less social support, which can increase recidivism risk because he doesn't have a strong network to help him stay out of trouble. That feels like a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED \u2013 education is a stabilizing factor. Without it, finding stable jobs is harder, which can lead to criminal activity. High risk here.\n\nHe's had two jobs in the past year. Employment instability could mean he's struggling financially, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. So that's medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially recent use, is a significant factor. Substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior, so high risk.\n\nFeeling down recently might indicate mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if untreated. But it's only mentioned once, so maybe medium.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in an urban area as a kid \u2013 urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and fewer resources, but having a biological parent could be stabilizing. Maybe low risk.\n\nBelieving in God might provide some support or moral framework, which can reduce recidivism. So that's low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are education level and drug use; mediums include age, prior arrests, living alone, employment instability, and mental health. Lows are physical build, family setup, and religion. The high factors are significant enough to tip the prediction towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Age (21 years):** Younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behavior due to ongoing development and peer influences. Risk level: Medium.\n\n2. **Arrests/Convictions:** Two arrests with one conviction suggest a pattern but aren't extensive. Risk level: Medium.\n\n3. **Physical Build:** Height and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism. Risk level: Low.\n\n4. **Living Situation (alone):** Lack of social support can increase risk factors. Risk level: Medium.\n\n5. **Education Level:** No diploma/GED limits job opportunities, increasing likelihood of reoffending. Risk level: High.\n\n6. **Employment History:** Two jobs in a year indicate instability, potentially leading to financial stress. Risk level: Medium.\n\n7. **Drug Use:** Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is linked to higher recidivism rates. Risk level: High.\n\n8. **Mental Health:** Recent feelings of depression may contribute if untreated. Risk level: Medium.\n\n9. **Family Background:** Living with a biological parent in an urban area has mixed implications but leans towards stability. Risk level: Low.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide a support system, reducing recidivism risk. Risk level: Low.\n\n**Prediction:** Considering the high-risk factors (education and drug use) along with several medium-risk elements, the likelihood of rearrest is significant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to developmental factors and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests with one conviction suggest a concerning pattern but not extensive criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight have no direct correlation with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits employment opportunities, raising recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs in a year suggest instability, potentially leading to financial stress.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depression could increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological father in urban area has mixed implications but leans towards stability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
