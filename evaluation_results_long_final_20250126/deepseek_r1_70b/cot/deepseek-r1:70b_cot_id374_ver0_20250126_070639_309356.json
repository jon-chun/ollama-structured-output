    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'm leaning towards high for this factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. A prior arrest without conviction doesn't necessarily indicate a strong criminal history, so maybe low on this one.\n\nHer height and weight are average, around 5'5\" and 150-174 lbs. There's no clear correlation between physical build and recidivism, so I'll consider this factor as low.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Being unmarried isn't a significant risk, but living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a minor concern. Maybe medium here.\n\nHaving a Bachelor's degree and being in grad school shows stability and lower recidivism risk. Education is a protective factor against criminal behavior, so this should be low.\n\nShe held two jobs in the past year. Employment history can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability. I'm thinking medium for this factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the last month. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism because it's linked to impaired judgment and criminal behavior. High here makes sense.\n\nFeeling down recently could point to mental health issues, which are associated with higher recidivism if not addressed. So medium on this one.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a rural area suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective against criminal behavior. Low risk here.\n\nHer belief in God might provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Religious involvement can be a protective factor, so low again.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and drug use; medium are living situation, employment history, mental health. The rest are low. The presence of two high-risk factors (age and substance use) might increase the risk, but her education and stable upbringing are strong positives. I'm on the fence but leaning towards predicting no recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, particularly those in their early twenties, tend to have higher rates of impulsivity and may be at an increased risk for engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"low\", \"Having only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited criminal history and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not typically correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a minor risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Completing a Bachelor's degree and being enrolled in graduate school indicates stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs could suggest instability, but employment generally reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying mental health issues that could increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"A belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
