    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big one. He's 21, which is still relatively young. Younger offenders tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate his age as a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending. This seems like a high-risk factor because it suggests he might not be deterred by previous legal consequences.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think his physical stature poses a significant risk one way or the other. That's probably a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could mean less social support. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. This feels like a medium risk factor because it's not the most influential, but it does play a role.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is concerning. Education often provides stability and opportunities, so lacking that could increase the likelihood of recidivism. I'm leaning towards medium here as well.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year, which might indicate instability in employment. Job instability can lead to financial stress, which sometimes drives individuals to crime. So, another medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so his abstinence lowers that particular risk. That's definitely low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism risks. So, another low risk factor here.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in an urban area might have its challenges, but without more info on family dynamics or adverse childhood experiences, I'm not sure how much this contributes. It seems like a low risk factor.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events could provide a sense of purpose and support, potentially lowering recidivism risk. So, that's also low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are his criminal history, medium include age, living situation, education, employment stability, and low factors cover the rest. Balancing these, I think there's a moderate chance he might reoffend, so prediction is YES with 58% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, and younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to factors like impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offending.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no stable family support can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to lack of supervision and support.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held four jobs in one year may indicate instability, which can contribute to financial stress and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism, as substance abuse is a significant predictor of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better mental health, which can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area at a young age does not strongly indicate increased risk without additional adverse factors.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence may provide a sense of purpose and accountability, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
