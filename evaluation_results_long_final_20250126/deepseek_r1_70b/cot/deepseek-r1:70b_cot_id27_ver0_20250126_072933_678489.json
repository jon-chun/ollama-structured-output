    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female. Age can be a significant factor; younger individuals are generally at higher risk due to impulsivity and ongoing development. However, being female might lower the risk compared to males, so it's a mixed factor. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without conviction is concerning but not as severe as a conviction. It shows some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, the severity is lower. Medium risk here.\n\nHer physical build\u20145'4\" and 139 lbs\u2014is average, so I don't see this as a significant factor. Probably low risk since it doesn't indicate anything unusual.\n\nLiving alone at her age might suggest independence or isolation. It could mean less support, which might increase risk, but it's not a strong indicator. Medium risk.\n\nEducational background: GED and not in college. Lack of higher education can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk. This is a medium factor because while it's not the highest risk, it does contribute.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which is linked to higher recidivism. So, medium risk here as well.\n\nDrug use is significant\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and daily use in the last month. Drug abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it's often tied to criminal activity. High risk factor.\n\nHer mental state: feeling down all the time for a month suggests depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental illness can increase recidivism risk. High risk here too.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environment is protective, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: she believes God influences her life. Spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor, reducing recidivism by providing support and moral framework. Low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risks are drug use and mental health issues. The medium factors include age, arrest history, living alone, education, and employment. Protective factors are gender, family background, and religion. Considering the balance, there's a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not excessively high risk.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system but is not a strong predictor of future offending.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not present a specific risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate independence or isolation, which could be a neutral or moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college suggests some educational attainment but limited opportunities, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year suggests some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to continued criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for an extended period could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor and reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and support, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
