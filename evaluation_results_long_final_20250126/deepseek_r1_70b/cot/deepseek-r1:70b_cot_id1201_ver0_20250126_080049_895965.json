    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's young. At 19, youth is a known risk factor because younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors. That's a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but not convicted. The number of arrests indicates repeated involvement with the law, which suggests a pattern. Even without convictions, this shows she's at higher risk, so that's medium.\n\nHer height and weight don't directly relate to recidivism, so I'll consider that low impact.\n\nLiving situation: she isn't living alone and has a household size of three. Stable living conditions can be protective, but without more details on the environment, it's hard to gauge. I'll mark this as low for now.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to criminal involvement. High-risk here.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment is a medium risk factor as it can contribute to recidivism.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this is high-risk.\n\nNo recent depression, which is positive, but mental health issues are more about protective factors. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, I'll note it as low risk.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a small household. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, so this is medium-risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life, which might mean less religious support. Some studies suggest religion can be a protective factor, so lack of it could slightly increase risk. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like age, education level, and drug use, along with medium factors such as arrests and employment instability. The prediction is YES for rearrest, but confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youth is a significant risk factor for recidivism as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests without conviction indicate potential criminal involvement but lack of convictions may suggest less severe offenses or other factors at play.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college is a strong predictor of recidivism as it limits opportunities and increases vulnerability to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held three jobs in one year may indicate instability, which can contribute to higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor as substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone and residing with others may provide some level of stability and support, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a biological mother in a household of size three may present some challenges but does not inherently indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal events may reduce the protective effect religion can have on behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
