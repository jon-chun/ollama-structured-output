    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and could still be in environments that lead to criminal behavior. So I'd rate age as high.\n\nNext, gender: male. Statistically, males are more likely to reoffend than females, so that's another high factor.\n\nEthnicity is Hispanic. I don't think ethnicity itself is a direct risk factor; it's more about systemic issues. But since the user mentioned it, maybe there's some context, but I'll consider it low because it's not inherently a risk factor.\n\nNumber of arrests: 6 times. That's quite a lot for an 18-year-old. Frequent arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that's hard to break, so high risk here.\n\nHe has been convicted, which means he's had contact with the criminal justice system beyond just arrest. This indicates more serious involvement, so high again.\n\nPhysical build: 5'6\" and 150-174 lbs. Not particularly unusual; doesn't stand out as a risk factor either way, so low.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single and living alone might mean less social support or stability, which can increase recidivism risk. I'll go with medium here.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education limits job opportunities, making it harder to reintegrate, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment: held only 1 job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might drive criminal behavior. Medium risk because it's not the worst case but still concerning.\n\nDrug use: used cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to illegal activities and impair judgment. High risk here.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed recently. No indication of current mental health issues, so low risk on this factor.\n\nLiving situation as a child: lived with biological mother in a rural area. Stable family environment, which is positive, but rural areas might have less access to resources. However, since it's stable, I'll rate it low.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has a role in his life. Sometimes religion can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this could be protective. Low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are high or medium. High factors like age, gender, arrests, conviction, education, drug use are significant. Medium ones include marital status and employment. The protective factor is his religious belief. So overall, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Statistical data indicates males have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a direct risk factor but may relate to systemic issues.\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"Six arrests by age 18 indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"A conviction suggests serious criminal justice system involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marriage may reflect less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit employment and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment suggests potential financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a known predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported, indicating lower mental health risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation as a child\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment despite rural location.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement may provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
