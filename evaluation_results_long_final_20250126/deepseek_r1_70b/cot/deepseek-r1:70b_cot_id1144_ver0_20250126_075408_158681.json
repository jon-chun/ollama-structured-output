    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and may be more influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I'll mark that as high.\n\nNext, gender: male. Statistics show males have higher recidivism rates than females, so medium risk here.\n\nHe's Hispanic. While there isn't an inherent risk in ethnicity itself, systemic factors might play a role. But without specific data on his community or background, I can't assign a high score. So maybe low.\n\nNo convictions despite three arrests. This could mean he's either not committing severe offenses or is getting lenient treatment. It suggests some involvement with the law but not necessarily serious yet. That feels medium.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'10\" and 290 lbs. That's quite heavy for his height, which might indicate health issues or a sedentary lifestyle. Poor physical health can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism because it might limit his activity level. So low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, but being single isn't a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium as some studies link marriage to reduced recidivism, but living alone is more neutral.\n\nGED certificate and not in college: having a GED is better than nothing, but not pursuing higher education might limit job opportunities, which can increase criminal behavior risk. So medium.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability. That's high risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive signs as substance abuse and mental health issues often increase recidivism. So low for both factors.\n\nLiving with both biological parents young in an urban area of six people: stable family background is protective, but urban areas might have higher crime exposure. The larger household size could mean more support. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, as religion can provide a support network and moral framework. So maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age, employment instability; mediums include gender, no convictions, education, family background; lows are the rest. The high factors are significant but not overwhelming. His lack of drug use and mental health issues are positives. I think he's at moderate risk overall, so prediction is YES with 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development of decision-making skills and potential susceptibility to peer influence.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"While gender isn't a direct determinant, statistical trends indicate males may have higher rates of recidivism compared to females.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity itself is not a risk factor; however, systemic factors may contribute indirectly but are not explicitly detailed here.\"),\n    (\"arrests without convictions\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest some level of involvement with the law but lack of convictions indicates either less severe offenses or successful legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"physical health/weight\", \"low\", \"Excess weight could indicate potential health issues, which might limit physical activity and associated risks.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Single individuals may have less stable social support networks compared to married peers, though this is not definitive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, but it doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk without other factors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but lack of higher education may limit employment opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to financial instability and idleness.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent depression reduces the likelihood of behaviors linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"A stable family environment with both biological parents is generally protective, though urban settings may pose challenges.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
