    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who was arrested but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I'll mark that as medium risk.\n\nHe's White, but race isn't directly a risk factor; it's more about societal factors, which aren't detailed here. So I won't assign a weight to this.\n\nHe's been arrested once without conviction. A single arrest without a conviction might indicate a lower likelihood of reoffending compared to multiple arrests or convictions. That seems like low risk.\n\nHis height and weight (6'5\", 220 lbs) could be intimidating, but unless there's a history of violence, it doesn't directly indicate recidivism. I won't assign a specific weight here since the question focuses on rearrest, not physical factors.\n\nHe lives alone and has never been married. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, and marital status isn't a strong predictor. This seems neutral, so low risk.\n\nEnrolled in school is positive. Education often reduces recidivism by providing structure and opportunities. That's definitely a low-risk factor.\n\nHeld one job in the past year suggests some stability but maybe not a strong work history. Employment can reduce recidivism, so this might be medium or low. I think it's better to go with low since having any job is positive.\n\nNo drug use for four years and no recent depression. Both are significant. Substance abuse and mental health issues are big predictors of recidivism, but their absence lowers the risk. So both factors are low.\n\nLiving with biological father in a stable household as a child is a protective factor. Family stability reduces recidivism risk, so that's low.\n\nBelief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism through social networks and personal values. That's another low-risk indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The only medium is his young age. So overall, the prediction for rearrest is likely NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19 years):** Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence. Rated as medium.\n\n2. **Single Arrest Without Conviction:** Indicates lower likelihood of reoffending compared to multiple arrests or convictions. Rated low.\n\n3. **Living Situation and Marital Status:** Living alone and never married, which is common at 19 and doesn't indicate instability. Rated low.\n\n4. **Enrolled in School:** Education provides structure and opportunities, reducing recidivism risk. Rated low.\n\n5. **Employment History:** Held one job suggests some stability, though not extensive. Rated low as any employment is a positive factor.\n\n6. **No Recent Drug Use or Depression:** Absence of substance abuse and mental health issues lowers recidivism risk. Both rated low.\n\n7. **Stable Family Background:** Living with biological father indicates family support, a protective factor. Rated low.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide social support and personal values that reduce recidivism. Rated low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMost factors are low-risk except age, which is medium. Overall prediction leans towards no rearrest with high confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests lower likelihood of reoffending compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Living situation and marital status\", \"low\", \"Living alone and never married are not indicative of instability at this age.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school is a positive factor that reduces recidivism risk by providing structure and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability, though it's limited.\"),\n    (\"No recent drug use or depression\", \"low\", \"Absence of substance abuse and mental health issues lowers the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Stable family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological father in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism through social networks and personal values.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
