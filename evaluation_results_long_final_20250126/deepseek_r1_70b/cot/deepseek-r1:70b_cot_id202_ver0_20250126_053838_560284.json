    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate age as medium risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't too bad; it's when there are multiple convictions that the risk increases. So this factor is low.\n\nHer height and weight don't directly relate to criminal behavior, so I won't consider those. Next, she's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less stability or support, but not being married at 20 isn't unusual. This could be a medium risk because living situation can affect social support.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities. That's a high-risk factor.\n\nShe held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which is a risk for reoffending. So that's medium.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support habits. High risk here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health isn't an immediate concern. That's low.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a large household in an urban area as a child: Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, but living with a biological parent is usually positive. The large household might mean less individual attention. I'll consider this medium risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are lack of education and drug use; mediums include age, living situation, employment instability, and upbringing. Lows are arrest history, mental health, religion, and physical traits.\n\nThe prediction is YES because the high-risk factors (education and drugs) significantly impact recidivism. Confidence is 75% due to these strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, she is considered a young adult, which is a medium risk factor for recidivism as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"low\", \"Having only one arrest and one conviction indicates a relatively low criminal history risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education level (no high school diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment history (held 1 job in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment history can contribute to financial instability, which may increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health (no recent depression)\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing (lived with biological mother in urban household of size 7)\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may present challenges, but living with a biological parent is generally positive.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs (believes God influences personal events)\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
