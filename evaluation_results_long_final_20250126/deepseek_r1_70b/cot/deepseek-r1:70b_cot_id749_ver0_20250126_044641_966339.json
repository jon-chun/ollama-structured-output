    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, which can increase recidivism risk. So I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement or a first-time offense, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHis physical build is average, 5'11\" and 140 lbs. There's no clear link between physique and recidivism, so I'll consider this low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, which might increase the chance of reoffending. I'm leaning towards medium for living situation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so medium risk here.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year. Stable employment is a protective factor against recidivism, so this seems low.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine indicates substance abuse, which is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. High risk here.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign as mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed lately, it's low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is protective, so that's low.\n\nBelieving in God might provide emotional support and reduce recidivism, so another low factor.\n\nPutting this together, the high risk from drug use stands out. Other factors are mostly medium or low. Considering all, I predict YES for rearrest but with moderate confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, particularly males in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher rates of impulsive behavior and are at a heightened risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"Having only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited criminal history or seriousness of the offense.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not typically correlate with an increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a positive factor, but not pursuing further education or vocational training might limit opportunities and increase idleness, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held one job in the past year suggests some stability and responsibility, which are protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly multiple substances like marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential substance dependency and associated risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the likelihood of mental health-related issues contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household during childhood is a protective factor against delinquency and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has a role in personal events can provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
