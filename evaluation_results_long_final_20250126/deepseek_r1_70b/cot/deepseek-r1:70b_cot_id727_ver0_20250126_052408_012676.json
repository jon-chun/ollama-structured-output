    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male's recidivism within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and might be more influenced by peers. So I think that's a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's male, which statistically is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to females. That's another point towards medium risk because while it's significant, gender alone isn't the strongest predictor.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Only one arrest without a conviction might mean less severe offense or maybe first-time mistake, so that could be low risk. It shows some involvement with the law, but not a pattern yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't really indicate much about criminal behavior, so I won't factor those in as risk factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes provide stability; living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk because lack of support can lead to higher recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is a big one. Lower education levels are linked with higher recidivism since job opportunities are limited. That's definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having multiple short-term jobs might indicate instability. So maybe medium risk here because while employment is positive, frequent changes could be a sign of issues.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the last four years. Marijuana isn't as strongly linked to crime as other drugs, but any drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. I'd say that's medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. So low risk here since he's not currently experiencing depression.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area as a child. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, but living with a biological parent is usually a positive. Maybe medium risk because the environment could be tough.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism by giving a sense of purpose. So that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age, education; medium include gender, living situation, job instability, drug use, upbringing; lows are arrest history, current mental health, religious beliefs. Overall, the balance leans towards higher risk, so I predict YES with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Age (19):** Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to factors like peer influence and underdeveloped impulse control. **High Risk.**\n2. **Gender (Male):** Statistically, males have higher recidivism rates than females. **Medium Risk.**\n3. **Arrest History (1 arrest, no conviction):** A single arrest without conviction may indicate a less severe offense or first-time mistake. **Low Risk.**\n4. **Marital Status (Never married) and Living Situation (Living alone):** Lack of marital status can indicate less stability; living alone might mean limited social support. **Medium Risk.**\n5. **Education (No high school diploma/GED):** Lower education often correlates with higher recidivism due to fewer job opportunities. **High Risk.**\n6. **Employment (2 jobs in the past year):** While employment is positive, frequent job changes may signal instability. **Medium Risk.**\n7. **Drug Use (Marijuana in the past four years):** Drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk. **Medium Risk.**\n8. **Mental Health (No recent depression):** Current mental health stability reduces recidivism risk. **Low Risk.**\n9. **Upbringing (Urban, large household with biological mother):** Urban environments may have higher crime rates but living with a parent is positive. **Medium Risk.**\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide support and reduce recidivism through purpose. **Low Risk.**\n\nConsidering these factors, the individual has significant high-risk elements (age, education) and several medium-risk factors, leading to an overall prediction of recidivism.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to factors like peer influence and underdeveloped impulse control.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Statistically, males have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate a less severe offense or first-time mistake.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital status can indicate less stability; living alone might mean limited social support.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lower education often correlates with higher recidivism due to fewer job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"While employment is positive, frequent job changes may signal instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Current mental health stability reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates but living with a parent is positive.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce recidivism through purpose.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
