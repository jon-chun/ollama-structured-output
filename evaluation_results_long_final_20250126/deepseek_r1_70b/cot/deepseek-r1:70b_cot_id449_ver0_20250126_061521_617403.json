    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 20. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So I'll mark that as high.\n\nHe's male, which statistically has a higher recidivism rate than females. That's another high-risk factor.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Since there's only one arrest without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator alone, so low risk here.\n\nHis height and weight don't particularly stand out as risk factors related to criminal behavior, so that's low.\n\nNever married: being single can sometimes correlate with instability, but it's more about lifestyle than a direct risk. I'll say medium.\n\nLiving situation is with others, which is better than living alone in terms of support and stability, so low risk there.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a good sign as he has some education, reducing recidivism chances. Low risk.\n\nNot enrolled in college: while not necessarily bad on its own, it might indicate less engagement in positive activities, but I think medium is appropriate here.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment stability can reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is concerning because substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nNo depression reported recently is positive; mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. So low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother as a child suggests stability, which is protective. Low risk.\n\nUrban upbringing: urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so medium risk.\n\nDoesn't believe God controls his life: this could reduce the deterrent effect religion might have on behavior, but it's not a strong factor. I'll go with low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age, gender, drug use; mediums are never married, urban area; lows elsewhere. The significant high-risk factors, especially drug use and young age, make me lean towards predicting YES for rearrest, with about 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (20 years old):** Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential peer influences.\n\n2. **Gender (Male):** Statistically higher rates of recidivism among males compared to females.\n\n3. **Arrest History (One arrest, no conviction):** Limited criminal history suggests lower immediate risk.\n\n4. **Height/Weight:** No direct correlation with criminal behavior; thus, low impact.\n\n5. **Marital Status (Never married):** Possible indicator of instability but moderate impact.\n\n6. **Living Situation (With others):** Support system in place reduces risk.\n\n7. **Education (GED):** Indicates completion of basic education, a protective factor.\n\n8. **Employment (Two jobs held):** Stability and engagement reduce recidivism likelihood.\n\n9. **Drug Use:** Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk significantly.\n\n10. **Mental Health (No depression):** Lower risk as mental health issues can increase recidivism.\n\n11. **Childhood Environment:** Stable upbringing with biological mother is protective.\n\n12. **Urban Upbringing:** Higher exposure to crime in urban areas poses a moderate risk.\n\n13. **Religious Beliefs:** Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk but not significantly.\n\n**Conclusion:** High-risk factors include age, gender, and drug use. Moderate risks are marital status and urban environment. Protective factors include stable living situation and employment history. The presence of multiple high-risk factors leads to a prediction of YES with 72% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to ongoing development and peer influences\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males statistically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction is a lower indicator of risk\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate some instability\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others provides support and stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED completion reduces recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history is protective\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases risk significantly\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother is protective\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime exposure\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Less religious influence may slightly increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
