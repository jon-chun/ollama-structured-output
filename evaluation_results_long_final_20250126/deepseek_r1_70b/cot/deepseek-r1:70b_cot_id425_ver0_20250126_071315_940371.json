    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to assess the risk of recidivism for an 18-year-old male. First, his age is a significant factor because younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of reoffending due to impulsive behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That single arrest might indicate some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's harder to gauge the severity or likelihood of future offenses. So I'd consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't stand out as a risk factor here. It seems low in terms of impact on recidivism.\n\nNot having a high school diploma is concerning because education often provides stability and opportunities. Lack of education can limit job prospects, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some employment history but also suggests instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism, so I'd rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years, is a notable factor. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates, even if it's not as severe as harder drugs. This would be a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving alone currently might indicate a lack of strong social support networks, which are crucial for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. However, since he grew up with both biological parents in an urban setting, there might be some family support. The current living situation is moderate, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nNo recent depression is positive, suggesting better mental health stability, which lowers the risk. So that's a low factor.\n\nHis religious views don't indicate much about his behavior, but a lack of belief in divine control could mean he feels more in control of his actions, which might not directly relate to recidivism. I'll consider this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium risks with some lows. His youth and unemployment/education issues are concerning, but the absence of conviction and stable upbringing might mitigate these. So overall, I'm predicting a moderate risk, leading me to say YES for recidivism with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Being 18 years old is associated with higher impulsivity and lower life experience, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, but without a conviction, the risk is moderate.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited opportunities and higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year indicates some instability in employment, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a concern but not as severe as other substances; however, it still contributes to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone may indicate some independence, but growing up with both biological parents in a stable household mitigates this risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests better mental health stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal events does not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
