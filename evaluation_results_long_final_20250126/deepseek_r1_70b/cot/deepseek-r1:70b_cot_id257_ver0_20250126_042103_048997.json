    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female's recidivism. Let me start by looking at each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female. Young age can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity, but being female might lower that a bit since males often have higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race. I don't think race itself is a direct risk factor; it's more about systemic issues, so maybe not a significant factor here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. No prior convictions are a good sign because it suggests this might be an isolated incident or she hasn't had a pattern of criminal behavior yet.\n\nHer physical build is 5'5\" and 120 lbs. Not particularly large or small, so maybe not much impact on recidivism risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, but being enrolled in school might counteract that by providing structure and support.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education often reduces recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of reoffending, but job stability might vary.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and legal issues.\n\nShe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if not addressed properly. They might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nLiving in a household of size six at a young age could indicate overcrowding or instability, which sometimes correlates with higher stress and behavioral issues.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and reducing recidivism risks by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: her lack of convictions is a big plus, education and employment are positives, but drug use and mental health concerns are negatives. The presence of religious beliefs might help mitigate some risks. Overall, the factors don't strongly point to a high risk, so I'd lean towards low recidivism prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Being young can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"While gender isn't a direct risk factor, females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests this may be an isolated incident rather than a pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Physical size does not strongly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never being married is common at 18 and doesn't inherently indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could suggest less social support, but it's also common for young adults.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school is a positive factor that reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held jobs suggests stability and responsibility, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use could indicate potential for substance-related issues but isn't as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate depression or emotional distress that could increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a large household doesn't strongly correlate with criminal behavior without other factors.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk by promoting positive behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
