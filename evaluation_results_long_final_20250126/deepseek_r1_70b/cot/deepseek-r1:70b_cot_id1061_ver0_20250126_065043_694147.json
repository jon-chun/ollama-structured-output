    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female and predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's young, only 18. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might be a first-time offense or something minor, so maybe medium risk here because it shows some involvement with the law, but not a pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'7\" and 146 lbs, which is average for her age group. I don't see this as a significant factor either way, so low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some instability or lack of support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium risk here because it could suggest limited social support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment. That's definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is another big one. Without stable employment, she might turn to illegal activities out of necessity or boredom. High risk here too.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it's linked to higher recidivism rates. Even though it's not specified if she's currently using, the recent use (past month) could indicate ongoing issues. So high risk.\n\nShe felt down most of the past month, which suggests possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism if untreated, so medium to high risk here. I'll go with medium because it's self-reported and we don't have a diagnosis.\n\nLiving in a large household (size 8) at a young age might indicate instability or neglect, which can contribute to behavioral issues. Medium risk since it's part of her background but not current.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. This could be a protective factor if she uses faith for support, so low risk because it might help reduce recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like age, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These are strong indicators. The mental health concern is moderate, but overall, the combination leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Youth is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"Arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest may indicate limited involvement in criminal activity but still poses some risk.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stature is not a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age could indicate instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially multiple substances, increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental health concerns\", \"medium\", \"Depressive symptoms can increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Household size and background\", \"medium\", \"Large household size may indicate instability but is not a direct predictor.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Faith can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
