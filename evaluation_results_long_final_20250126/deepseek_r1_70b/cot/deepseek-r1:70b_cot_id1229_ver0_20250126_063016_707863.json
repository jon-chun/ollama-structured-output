    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or environments that lead to criminal behavior. So I think this should be medium risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's her first arrest, so it's lower than someone with multiple arrests. Maybe low risk here because she doesn't have a conviction history.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to me in terms of recidivism. So I'll consider that as low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor. But not being married at 19 is pretty common, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. That's definitely a medium to high risk. I'll say medium because she has had three jobs recently, which might indicate some stability.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could mean she's struggling with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. So that's medium risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and used it most of the time in the past month. Regular drug use can definitely increase recidivism risk because it might lead to illegal activities or impair judgment. High risk here.\n\nShe felt down most days in the past month. Depression or mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, especially if untreated. Medium risk since it's self-reported but indicates a need for support.\n\nLiving in a household of size five as a child could mean overcrowding, which sometimes correlates with higher stress and less attention from parents, possibly increasing risk factors. I'll consider that medium.\n\nBelieving God influences her life might provide some positive coping or support, which can be protective. So low risk here because it suggests a support system or positive outlook.\n\nPutting all these together: several medium risks, a couple of high and low. The higher risks like drug use and mental health issues are significant. Her lack of education is a concern but she has job experience. Overall, I think the prediction leans towards YES for rearrest, maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at higher risk due to less developed decision-making skills and susceptibility to peer influence.\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"low\", \"First arrest without conviction suggests lower prior criminal involvement compared to those with multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could elevate risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held three jobs in a year suggests potential instability or challenges in maintaining steady employment, which could increase recidivism risk if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and regular marijuana use increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Self-reported feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, which might contribute to criminal behavior if untreated.\"),\n    (\"household_size_during_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a larger household could be associated with environmental stressors that may influence behavior and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
