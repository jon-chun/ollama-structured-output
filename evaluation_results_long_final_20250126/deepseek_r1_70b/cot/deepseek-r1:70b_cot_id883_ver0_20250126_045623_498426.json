    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big one. He's 19, which is young. Younger people are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'm leaning towards high risk here.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males do have a higher recidivism rate than females. That\u2019s another point towards a higher risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. The arrest itself shows some involvement with the law, but no conviction might mean it wasn't as severe or he didn't go through sentencing. So maybe medium risk here because an arrest indicates some level of concern without the full weight of a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 170 lbs. That doesn\u2019t seem particularly unusual; perhaps slightly above average but not in a way that would make him stand out as high risk. So I\u2019d say low risk on physical build.\n\nHe's never been married, which might relate to stability. Being single can sometimes correlate with less stable home life or fewer responsibilities, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nLiving alone could indicate independence, but it also means less social support and supervision. That might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior without someone to check it. So I'm thinking high risk for living situation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma, which is good\u2014it provides basic education and can help with employment. Not being enrolled in college doesn\u2019t necessarily add much risk since many don\u2019t attend college. However, having no jobs in the past year is concerning because unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. So I\u2019d rate this as medium to high.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so his abstinence lowers the risk here. That's definitely low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good too. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, that\u2019s another point towards lower risk.\n\nLiving with just his biological mother in a rural area as a child. Rural areas might have less access to resources and higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor. So medium here.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might provide some stability or positive outlook, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So low risk for religious beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), gender (medium-high?), arrest without conviction (medium), living alone (high), unemployment (medium to high). The positives are no drug use and stable mental health, which lower the risk.\n\nI think overall, despite some positive factors like education and no substance abuse, the combination of young age, unemployment, living alone, and past arrest might tip the prediction towards a higher likelihood. But confidence isn\u2019t super high because not all factors are negative.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates due to impulsive behavior and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"While males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, gender alone is not a strong predictor without other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"An arrest indicates some legal involvement but lacks the severity of a conviction, suggesting lower risk compared to those with convictions.\"),\n    (\"living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support and supervision, potentially increasing risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment status (unemployed)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and idle time.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces the likelihood of substance-related recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Recent stability in mental health lowers the risk compared to individuals with active mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
