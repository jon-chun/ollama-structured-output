    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict if he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could still be influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant number for someone so young, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. This definitely points to a higher risk, so that's another high factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't really stand out as risk factors. Being 5'10\" and 215 lbs is within a normal range, so I wouldn't consider this a significant factor either way. Low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might mean less social support. However, without more context on his relationships, it's not too high of a risk. Maybe medium.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is good, and being enrolled in college suggests he's trying to better himself. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activity. That seems like a medium risk because it's a significant factor but not as severe as others.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and some use recently. Drug use is linked to higher recidivism rates since it can impair judgment and lead to further offenses. This should be high risk.\n\nFeeling down lately could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, might contribute to criminal behavior. Mental health struggles are a known risk factor, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of six might have presented challenges like less individual attention or resources, but without specific negatives mentioned, it's hard to gauge. Maybe low risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life, which could mean lower religious-based social support. Some studies suggest religiosity can reduce recidivism, so this is a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, drug use, and mental health issues. The employment issue adds to the risk. Positive factors are his education, which might mitigate some risks. Overall, there's a higher likelihood of rearrest, so prediction is YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use may impair judgment and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate untreated issues linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might reduce social support, a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Large household size without specific negatives is less concerning.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
