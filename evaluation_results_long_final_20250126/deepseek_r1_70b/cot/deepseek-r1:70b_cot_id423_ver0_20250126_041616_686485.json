    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. He's young, only 22, which means he might still be in a phase where impulsive decisions are more common. Younger individuals generally have higher recidivism rates compared to older adults, so this could lean towards a medium risk.\n\nNext, his criminal history: two arrests and one conviction. This indicates some involvement with the law but isn't an extensive record. It's not too high, but it's also not negligible. I'd say that's a medium risk factor because having a conviction shows that he has engaged in criminal behavior beyond just being arrested.\n\nHis physical stature is 5'5\" and 155 lbs, which doesn't particularly stand out as a risk factor either way. It might be less relevant unless there's a specific context where size matters, but generally, this seems low risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support or supervision, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism, but being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual. I'm not sure if this is high or medium, but maybe medium because of the potential lack of stable social structures.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism as individuals might resort to crime due to unemployment. This seems like a high risk factor because it's a well-known correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs in the past year. This could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk for recidivism. Unstable employment can lead to financial strain, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. I'd rate this as medium risk because while it's not the most severe factor, job instability does contribute.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and some use in the last month. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism. Substances can impair judgment and lead to criminal activities, either directly or through association with certain peer groups. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nMental health: he's felt down recently. While this isn't a diagnosed mental illness, it could indicate underlying issues that might contribute to recidivism if not addressed. However, without more information on severity or treatment, I'd rate this as low to medium. Maybe medium because even mild depression can affect decision-making.\n\nFamily background: lived with his biological father in a household of four at a young age. Having both biological parents could be a stabilizing factor, so maybe this is a lower risk compared to broken homes or abusive environments. However, the size of the household might not directly impact recidivism much. I'm leaning towards low here.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God influences his life. This can be a protective factor as it may provide a sense of purpose and community support, which are positive influences against reoffending. So this would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher risks come from education, drug use, employment instability, criminal history, age, mental health, living situation, and lack of marital status. Protective factors include religious beliefs. Balancing these, I think there's a significant chance of rearrest, so prediction would be YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsive behavior and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"physical stature\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year may suggest instability, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying issues that could contribute to recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
