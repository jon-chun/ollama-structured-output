    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is young. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I'm leaning towards high risk here.\n\nShe's female, but gender alone isn't a strong predictor, so that's low risk.\n\nHer arrest count is 1 with no convictions. Only one arrest and no prior convictions suggest she might not have an extensive criminal history, which could indicate lower risk, so medium.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'1\" and 125-149 lbs. These don't really correlate with recidivism, so low risk.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Not being married isn't a big factor, but living with others might provide some stability, which is a protective factor, so medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a means to cope, so that's high risk.\n\nShe held one job in the past year. Having some employment history is positive but only having one job might indicate instability, which could be a moderate risk factor. I'll go with medium.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the last four years. Marijuana is less severe than other drugs, but any drug use can contribute to higher recidivism, so medium.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues like depression can increase recidivism, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that's a lower risk factor, so low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in an urban area of size 5. A stable family environment is protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could be a risk. I think the family stability outweighs the location, so medium.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, as some studies show religious involvement can reduce it, but this isn't a strong factor on its own, so low.\n\nPutting all these together: high risk factors are age and lack of education; medium include arrest count, job instability, drug use, urban upbringing. The rest are low. Considering the balance, I think she's at moderate risk overall for rearrest. So prediction is YES with 58% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (18):** Young age increases impulsivity and peer influence risk. High.\n2. **Gender (Female):** Lower recidivism rates generally, so low.\n3. **Arrests (1) and No Conviction:** Limited criminal history, medium.\n4. **Height/Weight:** Not relevant to recidivism, low.\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Stability from living with others, medium.\n6. **Education Lack:** Increases criminal propensity due to limited opportunities, high.\n7. **Employment (1 job):** Some stability but potential instability, medium.\n8. **Drug Use (Marijuana):** Contributes to recidivism risk, medium.\n9. **Mental Health (No Depression):** Lower risk factor, low.\n10. **Family Background:** Stable family mitigates urban environment risks, medium.\n11. **Religious Beliefs:** Not a strong predictor, low.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nHigh factors are age and education; mediums include arrests, employment, drug use, and upbringing. Prediction of rearrest is YES with moderate confidence at 58%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest without conviction indicates some criminal history but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not correlated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with others may provide stability, reducing isolation risks.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job suggests some stability but possible instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can contribute to recidivism risk but is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family upbringing in an urban area may have mixed influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has minimal impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
