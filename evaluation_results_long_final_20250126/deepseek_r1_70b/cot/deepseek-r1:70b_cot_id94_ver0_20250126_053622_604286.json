    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is young. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I think that's a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once before and has a conviction. Prior criminal history is a big indicator of future behavior. Having one arrest isn't too bad, but the fact that he was convicted shows the offense was serious enough. I'd say medium risk here because it's not an extensive record yet, but it's still concerning.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to me in terms of recidivism. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that would influence reoffending, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean a lack of supervision or support. Without a stable family environment, he might have fewer people to hold him accountable or provide guidance. That seems like a medium risk factor because it can contribute to poor decision-making but isn't the most critical factor on its own.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Not having higher education might limit his job prospects, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. I think that's medium risk as well.\n\nNot being employed in the past year is a big red flag. Unemployment is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to financial instability and desperation. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years and recent use, indicates some substance involvement. While marijuana isn't as serious as harder drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase risky behavior. I'd rate this medium because it's a contributing factor but not necessarily indicative of severe addiction.\n\nFeeling down recently could point to mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can lead to poorer life choices and increased recidivism risk. This is another medium factor since it's concerning but not the highest on its own.\n\nHis upbringing with his biological mother in an urban area of size three isn't inherently risky, so I don't see that as a major factor. It doesn't add much to the risk assessment one way or the other, so low risk.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with personal events might provide some sense of purpose or support, which could be protective against recidivism. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a deterrent or provide a support system, so I think this is a low-risk factor, actually possibly lowering his overall risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and unemployment; medium include prior conviction, living alone, education level, drug use, and mental health. Low factors are physical build, upbringing, and religious beliefs. The higher number of medium and high factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. I'm about 72% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (young)\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Prior criminal history (arrested once, convicted)\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal propensity but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"Physical build (5'10\\\", 178 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No specific relevance to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of supervision/support may influence poor decisions.\"),\n    (\"Education level (GED, no college)\", \"medium\", \"Limited education reduces job prospects, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (unemployed past year)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana past four years, recent use)\", \"medium\", \"Impairs judgment and increases risky behavior, though not severe addiction.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (recent depression)\", \"medium\", \"Untreated issues can lead to poor life choices.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing (urban, biological mother, household size 3)\", \"low\", \"No inherent risk factors in upbringing.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide purpose/support, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
