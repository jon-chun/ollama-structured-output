    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, criminal history. He's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that isn't changing, which points to a higher likelihood of reoffending. That should be high as well.\n\nHis physical build is 5'11\" and 135 lbs. Not particularly muscular, so maybe less likely to engage in violent crimes, but I'm not sure if this is a strong factor. Maybe low or medium. But since the data isn't clear on how much body type affects recidivism, I'll lean towards low.\n\nLiving situation: he's not living alone and has never been married. Unstable living conditions can contribute to higher risk because it might indicate a lack of support system. So that's probably medium.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism since it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal activity. High risk here.\n\nEmployment history: Held three jobs in the past year. Unstable employment could mean he's struggling to maintain work, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Medium or high? Maybe medium because it's not as severe as never having been employed, but still indicates instability.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase recidivism risk, especially if it's linked to criminal behavior. But since it's only marijuana and he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe it's a medium factor rather than high.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could provide some stability. Not sure how significant this is; perhaps low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God influences personal events. Religion can be a protective factor as it may provide moral guidance and support, potentially reducing recidivism. So that's probably a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together, the higher factors are age, criminal history, education, employment instability, and drug use. The lower ones are physical build and religious beliefs. The medium factors include living situation and family background. Overall, it seems like there are more high-risk elements than low, so I'd predict a YES for rearrest with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"At 21 years old, younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior that may continue without intervention.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Being underweight might reduce the likelihood of violent crimes, though this factor is less significant in recidivism prediction.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone could indicate instability, which might increase recidivism risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, but not as severe as no employment history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is linked to higher recidivism risk, though not as high as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent may provide some stability, reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
