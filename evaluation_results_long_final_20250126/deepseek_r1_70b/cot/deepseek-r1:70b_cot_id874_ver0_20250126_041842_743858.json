    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's been arrested once, convicted, and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control. So that could be a medium or high factor. I'm leaning towards medium because while young, he's also in college which might indicate some stability.\n\nGender and race: Being male is a known risk factor as males tend to have higher recidivism rates. His race is White, but I don't think race itself is a direct factor; it's more about socioeconomic status or systemic issues. So maybe medium for gender.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Single individuals might have less stable home lives which can increase risk. Medium here.\n\nLiving situation: Not living alone, so he has others around him. That could provide some support and stability, reducing the risk a bit. Maybe low.\n\nEducation and employment: He's got a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor as it can lead to better job opportunities and lower recidivism. Holding three jobs in a year might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk. So maybe medium for employment stability.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as strongly linked to crime as other drugs, but any drug use can impair judgment and increase risk. Probably low since it's not a harder drug.\n\nMental health: No depression in the past month. That's positive; mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism. So low here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a stable household of four. This is a protective factor as a supportive family can reduce criminal behavior. Low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't believe God influences his life. Some studies suggest that religious affiliation can lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. Maybe low or medium? I'll go with low since the impact might be minimal.\n\nPutting this all together, he has some risk factors like age and gender, but also several protective factors such as education and family support. His employment stability is a bit shaky, but the college enrollment suggests he's trying to improve his situation. So overall, the prediction would lean towards not being rearrested, with moderate confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life experience.\"),\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females, though this can vary based on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Never Married)\", \"medium\", \"Single individuals may lack the stabilizing influence of a spouse or family, which can increase risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Not Alone)\", \"low\", \"Living with others can provide support and reduce isolation, potentially lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education (High School Diploma + College Enrollment)\", \"low\", \"Higher education is associated with lower recidivism rates as it provides skills and opportunities for stable employment.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability (3 Jobs in One Year)\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or issues with maintaining employment, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"While drug use is a risk factor, marijuana is generally considered lower risk compared to other substances like cocaine or heroin.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (No Recent Depression)\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent depressive symptoms may reduce immediate mental health-related risks for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background (Stable Household with Biological Parents)\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment is a protective factor against recidivism, providing support and structure.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs (No Influence from God)\", \"low\", \"While religious beliefs can be protective, the absence of them does not necessarily increase risk significantly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
