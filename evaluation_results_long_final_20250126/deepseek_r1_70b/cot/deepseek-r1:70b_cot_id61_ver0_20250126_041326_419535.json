    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. He's been arrested once but not convicted yet. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From what I know, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because of impulsive behavior and still-developing decision-making skills. So that might be a medium or high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction could mean it's a first-time offense or maybe a minor issue that didn't lead to a conviction. However, having an arrest on record does indicate some level of involvement with the justice system, so I'd consider this as a low risk factor because it's just one instance and no conviction.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here unless we're considering physical factors related to crime, but most risk assessments don't weigh physical attributes heavily. So I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate a lack of strong social support structures, which might increase the risk because without a stable family environment, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, being single isn't a direct indicator by itself, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a protective factor against recidivism. Being enrolled suggests he's actively engaged in improving his situation, which lowers the risk. So this would be a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor as it might impair judgment and lead to further criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a positive sign. So I'd rate substance use as medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor against delinquency. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stability of the household could mitigate that risk. So this would be low.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: age (medium), arrest without conviction (low), living situation (medium), education (low), unemployment (high), substance use (medium), family background (low), religion (low). The high unemployment stands out, but the educational enrollment and stable upbringing are positives. The prediction is probably low because of the protective factors outweighing the risks. Confidence would be around 65% since there's a mix but more towards lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, which is within a higher-risk age group for impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support but isn't definitive.\"),\n    (\"education and enrollment\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, indicating positive engagement and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year could lead to financial instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
