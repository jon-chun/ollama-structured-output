    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's young, but not a juvenile. Young adults might still be figuring things out, which could mean higher risk, but it's not extremely high. Maybe medium?\n\nShe's female, and I know that men typically have higher recidivism rates than women. So her gender might lower the risk. That seems like a low factor.\n\nNo convictions yet, only arrests. Arrests without convictions can indicate less severe issues or maybe she's been lucky. This could be a good sign, so probably low risk here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior. I won't consider that as a significant factor. Maybe low or ignore it.\n\nNot married and not living alone. Living with others might provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. That sounds like a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nHigh school diploma is good\u2014she has basic education. But she's not in college, which could mean less stability or fewer opportunities. Not too bad, but maybe medium since education can be a stabilizing force.\n\nHeld one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides income and structure. Only having one job might indicate some instability, but it's better than none. Maybe medium?\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so not using drugs lowers her risk. Definitely low here.\n\nNo recent depression is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but she seems stable now. Low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents as a child in a larger household might provide a stable upbringing. Stable family background usually reduces risk. So low factor.\n\nReligious beliefs can be a protective factor, giving her a sense of purpose or community. That likely lowers her risk. Another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risks. She has some points like young age and limited job stability that could be medium, but overall, the positives outweigh them. I think she's at lower risk for rearrest, so prediction is NO with moderate confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young and may indicate ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrests without convictions\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest less severe criminal involvement or successful diversion from the justice system.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight are not directly indicative of criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Not being married and not living alone may indicate social support, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job in the past year suggests some stability but could indicate potential employment challenges.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years significantly reduces recidivism risk associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator of mental stability.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household suggests a supportive upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence may provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
