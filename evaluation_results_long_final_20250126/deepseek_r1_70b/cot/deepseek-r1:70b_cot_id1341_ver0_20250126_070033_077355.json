    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this person. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Age is a significant factor because younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism. Being in her early twenties might mean she's still developing and could be more impulsive, but I'm not sure if gender or ethnicity play a direct role here, so maybe that's neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's quite a few arrests. Each prior arrest increases the likelihood of recidivism because it indicates a pattern of behavior. So her criminal history is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 218 lbs. I'm not sure how body weight directly relates to rearrest risk, unless it's related to health issues that could influence behavior. But without more info, maybe this isn't a significant factor on its own.\n\nShe's married but living alone. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might mean less social support or supervision. I'm not sure if this is a medium risk because the stability of marriage could help, but living alone might counteract that a bit.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is important for employment opportunities. Not having higher education might limit her job options, which could increase recidivism risk if she can't find stable work. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment stability is crucial. Having multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which might relate to higher recidivism risk. But it's only two jobs, so perhaps medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. This is positive because substance abuse and mental health issues are big predictors of recidivism. So both factors would be low risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Stable family environment is a protective factor against recidivism, so that's probably low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. I'm not sure about the impact of religious beliefs on recidivism. Some studies say religious involvement can reduce recidivism, but it's not a direct factor for everyone. Maybe this could be neutral or low.\n\nPutting it all together: high criminal history, medium employment instability, maybe some risk from living alone and limited education, but positive factors like no drug use and stable upbringing. So overall, I'd say the prediction is high risk because the criminal history is a strong indicator, even with some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Five prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Marriage can be stabilizing, but living alone may reduce social support and supervision, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college and having held multiple jobs suggests possible instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_and_mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use or depression reduces the likelihood of recidivism driven by these factors.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in a stable household during youth is a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
