    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old male based on various factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a factor. He's 22, which is young but not a teenager anymore. Younger people are generally at higher risk, so maybe medium here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Two arrests show some criminal history, but it's not extensive. I'd say medium for prior record.\n\nHis height and weight are average, nothing unusual there\u2014probably low risk.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor. So medium.\n\nHaving a high school diploma and being in college suggests stability. Education usually lowers recidivism, so that's a low risk.\n\nHe held four jobs in a year, which might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job. That seems risky, so high.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive. Substance abuse is a big factor, so this is low risk.\n\nFeeling down recently could indicate mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if not addressed. So medium.\n\nLiving with both parents young in an urban area might have its own challenges, but stable family initially\u2014maybe low.\n\nBelieving in God suggests some support system or positive outlook, which is protective\u2014low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: two highs (employment instability and mental health), a few mediums, and several lows. His education and no drug use are positives. I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but with moderate confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age range for recidivism, though not extremely young.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate some criminal history, but it's not extensive.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build, no apparent risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support or supervision.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest stability and positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"job_instability\", \"high\", \"Four jobs in a year suggests instability, which could correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age suggests a stable upbringing, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
