    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is definitely a risk factor here because younger individuals, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, tend to have higher rates of recidivism. The brain isn't fully developed, which can lead to poorer decision-making. However, I'm not sure if being Black by itself is a direct risk factor; it's more about systemic issues, but I'll focus on the factors provided.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Arrests without convictions don't always indicate guilt, but multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could be problematic. The conviction does add weight because it shows he's had contact with the criminal justice system beyond just being arrested.\n\nHis height and weight\u20146 feet tall and 168 lbs\u2014don\u2019t strike me as particularly significant in terms of recidivism risk. Physical build isn't a strong predictor unless we're considering specific types of crimes, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone could be a factor because it might indicate a lack of social support or supervision. Marriage often correlates with lower recidivism because it provides stability and accountability. Not being married isn\u2019t bad on its own, but combined with living alone, it might suggest he doesn't have a strong support network.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be protective against recidivism because it offers better job opportunities and social integration. However, not going to college isn't a huge risk by itself. The bigger issue here is that he hasn\u2019t held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it leads to financial instability, which can drive individuals back to criminal activity.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some of the time in the past month. Drug use, especially recent use, is a known risk factor. It can impair judgment and lead to involvement in activities that increase the likelihood of arrest. However, marijuana is less directly linked to violent behavior compared to harder drugs, so I might not rate this as high as other substances.\n\nHe's experienced some depression recently, feeling down for parts of the past month. Mental health issues can definitely contribute to recidivism if they're not addressed. Depression can lead to poor decision-making and may increase substance abuse, which in turn raises recidivism risk.\n\nLooking at his upbringing, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size eight in an urban area from a young age. Growing up in a large household might indicate resource strain or less individual attention, which could contribute to behavioral issues. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which can be a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: his age is a significant risk because of the association with higher recidivism rates among young people. His unemployment is another major red flag\u2014it\u2019s a strong predictor. Drug use, especially recent, adds to the risk but maybe not as severely as harder drugs. Mental health issues are concerning and can exacerbate other factors. Living alone and lack of marriage indicate lower social support, which can increase recidivism chances.\n\nOn the flip side, he has a high school diploma, which is a positive factor for stability. The urban upbringing could be a risk, but without more specifics on neighborhood conditions or family dynamics beyond size, it's hard to weigh too heavily.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014age (high), prior arrests/convictions (medium because three arrests and one conviction isn't extremely high but still concerning), unemployment (high), drug use (medium), mental health (medium), living situation (low-medium), education (neutral or low risk). The combination leans towards a higher risk, so I think the prediction should be YES. Confidence-wise, maybe around 70% because while several factors point to higher risk, some elements like having a diploma and not being married yet don't tip it into very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk of recidivism due to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests/convictions\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can impair judgment but isn't as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Depression may contribute to poor decision-making and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone suggests lower social support, a minor risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
