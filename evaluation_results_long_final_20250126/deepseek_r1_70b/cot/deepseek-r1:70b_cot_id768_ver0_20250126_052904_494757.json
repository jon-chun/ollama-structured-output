    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be influenced more by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. A history of multiple arrests indicates a pattern of behavior that doesn't align with the law, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight (5'4\", 180 lbs) don't directly relate to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Not being married isn't a direct indicator, but living alone might suggest less social support or supervision, which can be a medium risk factor.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive because education often reduces recidivism, so this should be low risk. She's not in college, but that's neutral on its own unless other factors are involved.\n\nShe held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment or personal behavior, which might correlate with higher risk, so medium.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine, especially recently, can impair judgment and increase illegal activities. High risk here.\n\nFeeling down lately might point to mental health issues like depression, which can lead to self-destructive behaviors. This could be a medium risk as it might contribute to recidivism if untreated.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of six isn't directly risky, but overcrowding or lack of attention could have influenced her behavior. I'll consider this low unless other factors are present.\n\nBelieving in God can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a protective factor, making it low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, drug use, recent depression, job instability, and living alone. These likely outweigh the protective factors of education and religious beliefs. So I predict she'll be rearrested with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Age (21):** Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\n2. **Arrests/Convictions:** Four arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\n3. **Substance Use:** Recent drug use can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\n4. **Mental Health:** Recent feelings of depression may contribute to self-destructive behaviors if untreated.\n5. **Employment Instability:** Holding three jobs suggests instability, which might correlate with risky behavior.\n6. **Living Situation:** Living alone could indicate less social support or supervision.\n7. **Education and Marital Status:** High school diploma is a protective factor; being unmarried isn't directly risky.\n8. **Religious Beliefs:** Can provide emotional support, acting as a protective factor.\n\n**Prediction:** Considering the high-risk factors outweigh the protective ones, there's a 70% chance of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behavior and may have less developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying issues that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Employment Instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs suggests instability, which might correlate with higher risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could reduce social support and supervision, potentially increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
