    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested six times but not convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So I'll mark that as medium.\n\nNext, he's male. Statistically, males have higher recidivism rates than females, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHe has six arrests without convictions. While arrests indicate involvement in criminal activity, the lack of convictions might mean charges were dropped or he wasn't prosecuted, which could suggest less severe offenses. I'll categorize this as medium risk because frequent arrests still point to potential ongoing issues.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't stand out as a significant factor here. That's low.\n\nLiving alone at 21 might indicate instability or isolation, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to lack of support. I'll rate this medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma is a concern because limited education can reduce employment opportunities, increasing recidivism risk. Plus, he hasn't enrolled in college and has held only one job in a year. Unstable employment is another risk factor for recidivism, so both factors contribute to a medium rating here.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed now. Substance abuse and mental health issues are major predictors, but since he's clear on both, this lowers his risk. That's low.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area is mixed. Stable family can be protective, but urban environments might have higher crime exposure. This could go either way, so I'll consider it medium.\n\nHis belief in God might provide a support system and moral framework, which can reduce recidivism risk. That's another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of factors are medium with a few lows. His youth, gender, arrest history, living situation, and education/employment status are concerning, but stable family, lack of substance abuse, and religious beliefs are positives. So I think the recidivism prediction is YES with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (21):** Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence. Rated medium.\n2. **Gender (Male):** Higher statistical recidivism rates among males. Rated medium.\n3. **Arrests (6) without convictions:** Indicates possible ongoing issues but less severe. Rated medium.\n4. **Physical Build (Average):** No significant impact. Rated low.\n5. **Living Situation (Alone):** Suggests isolation or instability. Rated medium.\n6. **Education/Employment:** Lack of diploma and unstable job history increase risk. Rated medium.\n7. **Substance Abuse (None in 4 years):** Lowers risk. Rated low.\n8. **Mental Health (No depression):** Reduces immediate risk. Rated low.\n9. **Family Background (Stable with both parents):** Protective factor. Rated low.\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Potential protective factor. Rated low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile several medium-risk factors exist, the presence of stable family and religious beliefs lowers overall risk. However, the combination of youth, gender, arrests, living situation, and employment issues leads to a prediction of recidivism with moderate confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Statistical data shows males have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Six arrests without convictions indicate possible ongoing issues but less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest instability or isolation increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and unstable employment increase recidivism risk factors.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces immediate mental health risks.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
