    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female. I know that younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So age is probably a medium or high risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests indicate some level of criminal activity, but two isn't too high. The conviction does add to the risk, though, so maybe medium here.\n\nHer height and weight are average, 5'6\" and 125-149 lbs. I don't think physical build is a major factor in recidivism unless it's extreme, which it isn't here. So low risk for this one.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor because they provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college suggests limited education, which is linked to higher recidivism since it affects job prospects. So medium risk here.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which could lead to criminal behavior due to financial stress. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a significant concern. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which are substances that can impair judgment and increase illegal activities. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. So high here.\n\nShe reported feeling down most days recently, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can lead to higher recidivism as they might turn to drugs or other negative behaviors. High risk for this factor too.\n\nHer upbringing with her biological mother in a rural area of four people is relatively stable compared to more chaotic environments. Rural areas sometimes have less access to services, but the household size isn't too large. Maybe medium, but I'm not sure if this is a major factor. Perhaps low since it's not indicating neglect or abuse.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: age (medium), criminal history (medium), education level (medium), employment stability (medium), drug use (high), mental health (high). The protective factors are marriage and religious beliefs. The higher weight comes from drug use and mental health, which are strong predictors. I think the overall prediction would be YES for rearrest, with a confidence around 75 because several high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and less developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History (Arrests)\", \"low\", \"Two arrests indicate some criminal activity but not an extensive history, so this is a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse provides stability, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Having only one job in the past year indicates instability which could contribute to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism risk due to impaired judgment and illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Depression symptoms can lead to negative behaviors, increasing recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother in a rural area is not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide purpose and support, reducing recidivism likelihood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
