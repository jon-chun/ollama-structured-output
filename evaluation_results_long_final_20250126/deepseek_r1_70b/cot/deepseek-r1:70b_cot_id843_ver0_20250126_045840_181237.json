    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could still be in environments that lead to criminal behavior. So, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNext, number of arrests and convictions. He has eight arrests and at least one conviction. This indicates a pattern of repeated offending, which is a strong predictor for recidivism. High risk here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant unless they contribute to aggression or flight risk, but without more context, I'll consider this low.\n\nMarital status: never married. Studies show that marriage can be stabilizing, so being single might mean less social support, increasing risk. Medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, which might elevate risk, so medium as well.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. While having a diploma is positive, not continuing education might limit job opportunities, potentially leading to criminal activity. So, medium.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs in the past year. This shows some stability but also possible instability if he's changing jobs frequently. I'll assess this as low because it indicates some effort towards employment.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and recent use could impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk. High risk here.\n\nMental health: feeling down recently. While not a diagnosis, it suggests possible depression or emotional distress which can lead to impulsive behaviors. Medium risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in a large household. Stable family structure is protective, so low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn't believe God influences his life. Lower religiosity might reduce a protective factor against recidivism, so medium.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like prior convictions and drug use, along with multiple mediums. This suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (8) and convictions\", \"high\", \"A high number of prior arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of offending behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"No specific risk is associated with the given height and weight range.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (never married)\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can sometimes indicate fewer stabilizing social influences.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and oversight, which could elevate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level (high school diploma, not in college)\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but the lack of higher education might limit opportunities, increasing recidivism risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (held 2 jobs in the past year)\", \"low\", \"Recent employment suggests some stability and effort to maintain income, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental health concerns (felt down in dumps recently)\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate emotional instability, potentially increasing impulsive or risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family background (lived with both biological parents)\", \"low\", \"A stable family upbringing is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs (does not believe God influences personal events)\", \"medium\", \"Lower levels of religious belief can sometimes reduce a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
