    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger individuals, especially males in early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have stable life structures or may be more impulsive. So age is a medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. Only one arrest without a conviction suggests maybe it was a minor offense or first-time mistake. Not too high-risk here, so low.\n\nHis height and weight are average, nothing stands out there. Physical build isn't typically a major factor unless extreme, which it's not here. So low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married. Single individuals might have less stability or support systems compared to those married. That could relate to higher risk, but since he's young, maybe medium risk.\n\nLiving alone now. Living alone can mean less social supervision and support, which is a risk factor. Medium here.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not in college. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit job opportunities, which could increase recidivism risk. So medium.\n\nEmployment: held no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it leads to financial instability and idleness. High risk here.\n\nSubstance use: no drug use in four years, so that's positive. Low risk.\n\nMental health: not feeling depressed recently. That\u2019s good, lower risk of issues related to mental health contributing to reoffending. Low.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in an urban area. Stable family structure is a protective factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is positive. Maybe medium because urban environment has its challenges.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God influences his life. Religious affiliation can be a protective factor, providing support and moral guidance. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high employment risk stands out, but other factors are mostly medium or low. I think his overall prediction is NO for rearrest, with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (21):** Younger individuals, especially males in their early twenties, often have higher recidivism rates due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability. This is a medium risk factor.\n\n2. **Arrest History (One arrest, no conviction):** A single arrest without conviction suggests it might have been a minor offense or a first-time incident, indicating lower risk.\n\n3. **Physical Build:** Average height and weight don't pose significant risks related to recidivism.\n\n4. **Marital Status (Never married):** Being single can imply less stability or support, but at 21, this is common and moderately risky.\n\n5. **Living Situation (Alone):** Living alone reduces social support and supervision, posing a moderate risk.\n\n6. **Education (High school diploma, not in college):** Having a diploma is positive, but lack of higher education may limit job opportunities, contributing to medium risk.\n\n7. **Employment (Unemployed for a year):** Unemployment significantly increases recidivism risk due to financial instability and idleness, marking this as a high-risk factor.\n\n8. **Substance Use:** No recent drug use lowers this risk factor.\n\n9. **Mental Health:** Recent stability in mental health reduces associated risks.\n\n10. **Family Background:** A stable upbringing with biological parents is protective, though urban environments have higher crime rates, leading to a medium assessment.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs:** Religious affiliation can provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nHigh employment risk is significant, but other factors are moderate or low. Overall prediction leans towards no rearrest with 65% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially males in their early twenties, may have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests a minor offense or first-time mistake, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose significant risks related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married individuals may have less stability or support systems compared to those married, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social supervision and support, which might be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit job opportunities, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a significant risk factor as it can lead to financial instability and idleness, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests a lower risk of substance-related issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently indicates better mental health stability, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological parents in an urban area provides some stability but urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidance and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
