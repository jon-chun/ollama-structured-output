    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race itself is a direct risk factor. It's more about socioeconomic factors, which aren't detailed here, so maybe this isn't too relevant.\n\nHe has one arrest but no convictions. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, it might mean this was a first-time offense or a less severe charge, which could lower his risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 204 lbs. I don't see how that directly relates to recidivism unless it's about physical strength in certain crimes, but without knowing the type of arrest, this might be a low factor.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Being single could mean less stable home life or fewer responsibilities, which can increase risk. Not living alone might indicate he has family support, which is positive, so maybe this is medium.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Having a GED shows some level of education, which is better than dropping out, but not being enrolled in higher education might limit his job opportunities, which could be a risk factor for recidivism. So medium here.\n\nHeld four jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor. If he's having trouble keeping jobs, it might suggest impulsive behavior or financial stress, so high risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support habits or impaired judgment. High risk here.\n\nNo recent depression. That's positive; mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might lower his risk. Low factor.\n\nLiving with biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which is a risk. Also, living with his mom suggests stability, so maybe medium.\n\nDoesn't believe God has anything to do with him personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, but it's not as strong a factor as others. Maybe low.\n\nPutting this together: Age (high), no conviction (low), job instability (high), drug use (high). The other factors are medium or low. So the high factors might tip the prediction towards YES for rearrest, maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple convictions or arrests.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried may indicate less stable home life, but not living alone could imply family support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but lack of college enrollment might limit job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"high\", \"Holding four jobs in one year suggests instability, potentially indicating impulsive behavior or financial stress.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to potential criminal activity related to substance use.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates lower risk compared to individuals with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime rates, but living with biological mother suggests stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
