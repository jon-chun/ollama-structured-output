    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and may lack stability. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe's Black, but race itself isn't a direct risk factor; it's more about systemic issues. Without more info on how race impacts his situation here, I'll consider this low.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant, so that's probably low.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so that's definitely low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, which might increase risk. That feels medium.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is good; education usually reduces recidivism. Not being in college is neutral, but the diploma still helps lower risk, so low.\n\nHolding one job in a year suggests some instability. Employment stability is important, so this is medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so high here.\n\nNo recent depression is positive; mental health issues can increase recidivism, but he's not feeling depressed now, so low.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child might expose him to more crime, but it's not a direct factor. I'll go with medium.\n\nBelieving in God could provide support and lower risk, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together: several medium factors and one high (drug use). His employment instability and living alone are concerns, but the lack of conviction and positive factors like education and beliefs might balance it out. I think his recidivism risk is moderate, so prediction is YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age**: At 22 years old, individuals may still be in a phase where they engage in higher-risk behaviors, which can elevate the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n2. **Race**: While race isn't a direct risk factor, systemic factors might influence outcomes, though without specific data, this is considered low.\n\n3. **Arrest History**: One arrest without conviction suggests less severe criminal involvement, lowering the risk.\n\n4. **Physical Build**: Height and weight aren't directly linked to recidivism, so this is a low factor.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\n\n6. **Education**: Having a high school diploma is protective against recidivism, reducing the risk.\n\n7. **Employment Stability**: Holding only one job in a year suggests instability, which can be a risk factor for reoffending.\n\n8. **Substance Use**: Use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine is a significant predictor of higher recidivism rates due to potential continued involvement.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: No recent depression reduces the risk since mental health issues can contribute to recidivism.\n\n10. **Childhood Environment**: Growing up in an urban area might expose individuals to higher crime environments, slightly increasing risk.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: A belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism risks by offering a moral framework.\n\n**Conclusion:** The individual has a mix of low, medium, and one high-risk factor (substance use). While employment instability and living alone are concerns, positive factors like education and religious beliefs may mitigate these. Overall, the risk is moderate, leading to a prediction of recidivism with 65% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential ongoing risky behaviors and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a direct predictor, but systemic factors may play a role; however, without specific data, this remains low.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly correlated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma reduces the likelihood of recidivism as education is protective.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in a year suggests instability, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates potential substance abuse issues, a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk as mental health issues can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area at a young age may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
