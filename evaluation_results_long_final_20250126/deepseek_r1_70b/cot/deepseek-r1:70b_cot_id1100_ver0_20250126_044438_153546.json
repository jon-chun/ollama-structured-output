    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. But 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males do have a higher recidivism rate than females. That could lean towards high, but I don't want to overemphasize it without other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has one conviction. Three arrests in a short period suggest a pattern of behavior that might not be changing, so that seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, around 5'5\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical size is a strong predictor here, so probably low risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Marriage can sometimes stabilize individuals, but living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk factor for recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Lack of education often limits job opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending, so that's probably a high risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which is a known risk factor for recidivism, so medium here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the last four years, especially using most days in the past month. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. High risk.\n\nHe's felt down most days recently. Mental health issues like depression can increase recidivism if not addressed, so medium risk here.\n\nGrowing up with adoptive parents in an urban area might have its own challenges, but without more info on family dynamics, I'm not sure. Maybe low risk since it's just the household size and structure.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has a role in his life. Some studies suggest religious beliefs can reduce recidivism, so lack of belief might be a low to medium risk factor, but I'll say low because it's less direct than other factors.\n\nPutting this all together: several high-risk factors like prior convictions, drug use, and unemployment. So I think the prediction is YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is statistically associated with a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to female.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior that may suggest a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone could indicate limited social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some instability in employment, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly cocaine, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential continued criminal behavior to support drug habits.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling 'down in the dumps' most days could indicate depression or other mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with adoptive parents in a household of size 3 in an urban area does not strongly indicate a specific risk factor for recidivism without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of belief in divine influence over personal events is less directly linked to recidivism compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
