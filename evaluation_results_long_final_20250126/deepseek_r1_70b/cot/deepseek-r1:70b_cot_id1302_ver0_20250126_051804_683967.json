    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have as much life stability yet. So I'd say high.\n\nHe's male and Black. Unfortunately, statistics show that being a young Black male can correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues. That also seems like a high factor.\n\nHe has two prior arrests and one conviction. Prior criminal history is a strong predictor of future offenses, so this should be high as well.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here, so low.\n\nMarital status: never married. Single people might have less social support, which can increase risk. Medium seems right.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism because there are fewer job opportunities. High risk here.\n\nHe's had two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having some work history is positive. But only holding two jobs might indicate instability. I think medium.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years and in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for reoffending, so high.\n\nFeeling down recently: mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. High again.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of size four. A stable family structure might be protective, but I'm not sure how much this weighs. Maybe low since it's more about living situation than direct risk.\n\nBelieves God influences events: religion can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing recidivism. So low here.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are high or medium. Especially the prior convictions, drug use, mental health issues, lack of education, and demographics point towards a higher risk. I'm pretty confident this leads to a prediction of YES with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"At 22 years old, the individual is in a high-risk age group for recidivism due to potential lack of life stability and maturity.\"),\n    (\"Gender and Race\", \"high\", \"Being a young Black male statistically correlates with higher recidivism rates, influenced by systemic factors.\"),\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never having been married may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could imply less supervision or support, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited opportunities and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year indicates some stability but also possible job instability, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential continued substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Experiencing feelings of depression recently may indicate unmet mental health needs, increasing the risk of reoffending if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a stable household suggests a supportive environment, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
