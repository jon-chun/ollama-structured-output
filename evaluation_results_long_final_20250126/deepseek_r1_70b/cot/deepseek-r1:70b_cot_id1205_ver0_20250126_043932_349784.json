    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19, which is quite young. Younger people, especially in their late teens and early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to arrest. So I think age would be a high-risk factor here.\n\nShe's female. From what I know, males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, so being female might lower her risk. That makes gender a low-risk factor.\n\nShe has one prior arrest but no convictions. Having an arrest on record could indicate some level of risk, but since she wasn't convicted, it's not as severe. Maybe that's medium risk because the arrest shows some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's less clear.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. Physical attributes like that usually aren't predictors unless in specific contexts, which we don't have here. So I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, but being unmarried at 19 isn't unusual. It could go either way, but maybe it's a low risk since it doesn't indicate instability necessarily.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive because education can reduce recidivism by providing better job opportunities. Not being enrolled in college might limit her future prospects, though. Overall, this seems like a medium factor\u2014some stability from the diploma but potential issues from not continuing education.\n\nNo jobs in the past year could be a red flag. Employment often reduces recidivism risk because it provides structure and income. Unemployment can lead to more opportunities for criminal behavior out of necessity or boredom. So unemployment is high risk here.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is great. Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism, so this lack of recent use lowers her risk, making it low.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive too. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not managed, but she seems mentally stable now, so that's another low factor.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a small household in an urban area as a child: Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, which could be a risk. However, living with a biological parent is generally stabilizing. The impact might balance out to medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism in some cases. Without that, she might not have the same protective factors, so this could be medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and unemployment; low factors include gender, physical attributes, mental health, substance use, living situation, and education (to an extent). The rest are medium. So while there's some risk, particularly with her young age and lack of employment, other protective factors like stable family background, no drug use, and being female might lower the overall risk. I think she's less likely to recidivate than not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female typically correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some level of legal involvement but not necessarily a high-risk pattern.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are generally not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age is common and does not inherently indicate instability or increased risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but unemployment in the past year could increase vulnerability to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces the likelihood of substance-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest better mental stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area might expose individuals to higher crime rates, but a stable household with biological parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce access to support networks that can mitigate recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
