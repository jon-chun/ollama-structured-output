    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male's recidivism. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, he's young, only 18. I remember that younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So his age is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. That shows some criminal history, but it's not an extensive record yet. Maybe medium risk here because while he has prior arrests, it's not a long list of convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are pretty average, so I don't think that contributes much to the risk. So physical build would be low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism because without a strong support system, he might be more likely to reoffend. That seems medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a big deal. Education usually helps with job prospects, and without it, he might struggle to find stable employment, which can lead to criminal activity. So that's high risk.\n\nHe held one job in the past year, which isn't very stable. Unemployment or unstable work history is linked to higher recidivism because it can lead to financial instability. That would be medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk here. That's low.\n\nHe reported feeling down recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending, especially if they're untreated. So that's a medium risk.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area might have its own challenges, like limited resources or higher exposure to crime. But living with a biological parent is generally more stable than foster care, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. If he lacks spiritual support or a sense of purpose, that might not provide the same protective factors as having religious beliefs. So I'm considering this as medium risk because it could influence his behavior without that guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are age and lack of education; medium include criminal history, living alone, unemployment, mental health, and spirituality; low are physical build and family environment. Overall, the higher number of medium and some high-risk factors make me lean towards a prediction of YES for recidivism with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and underdeveloped decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases unemployment risks and instability.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year suggests instability which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor significantly.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate untreated issues raising recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"family environment\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother provides more stability than foster care might.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual beliefs may reduce protective factors against reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
