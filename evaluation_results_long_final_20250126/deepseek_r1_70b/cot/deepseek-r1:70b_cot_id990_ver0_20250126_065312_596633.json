    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person's recidivism. Let me start by going through each detail step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is a big factor; being young can sometimes mean more impulsivity, but it also might mean she's still developing and could change her behavior. Her gender isn't as significant in most models, I think, but combined with age, maybe it's a lower risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest without conviction doesn't necessarily mean she's guilty, so that might not weigh too heavily. It's a low factor because there's no proven guilt yet.\n\nHer physical description: 5'7\" and between 175-199 lbs. That's on the heavier side for her height. I'm not sure how much weight (no pun intended) to give this. Maybe it's more about health than criminal behavior, so probably low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence or maybe instability? Not being married is common at that age, but living alone could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might be a medium risk factor for recidivism because without support, she might be more likely to get into trouble again.\n\nShe's enrolled in school right now. Education is usually a protective factor. It shows she's engaged and has structure, so that should lower her risk, making it a low factor.\n\nShe held 2 jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism because it provides stability and income. Having two jobs might mean she's responsible or maybe she's struggling to keep one, but overall, employment is a positive sign, so low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to further criminal activity either through drug-seeking behavior or impaired judgment. This should be a high-risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if not addressed, but since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe that's not an immediate concern. So low risk here.\n\nHer living situation as a child: lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up with both parents or a consistent caregiver can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so this would be a low-risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation might mean less access to certain support networks, but it's not a direct indicator of recidivism. I'm not sure how much weight to give this; maybe medium because some studies show religious involvement can lower recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors.\n\nPutting all these together: High risk from drug use, medium from living alone and lack of religion, the rest are low. The high factor (drug use) is significant, so I think the prediction would be YES for rearrest within 3 years, with maybe around 70% confidence because while drug use is a biggie, she has some protective factors like school enrollment and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18 years old, youth may contribute to impulsive behavior but also potential for change.\"),\n    (\"arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"No proven guilt, so limited impact on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"physical description\", \"low\", \"Weight and height are not strong indicators of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"May indicate instability or lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having jobs suggests stability and reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse increases likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, so lower immediate concern.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological parent is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious support might reduce some protective factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
