    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. A single arrest without a conviction might indicate that the charges were dropped or dismissed, which could mean less severity. So prior criminal history seems low here.\n\nHis marital status is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. That points to a low risk for this factor.\n\nHe has a GED, so he's completed his basic education. Education can provide better opportunities and reduce criminal tendencies, so that's another low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nRecent drug use with marijuana is present, but since it's not specified as heavy or problematic beyond personal use, I might rate this as low. However, I should consider if frequent use could impair judgment, so maybe medium.\n\nHe reported feeling down most days in the past month, which indicates possible depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated, so that's a medium factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a rural area suggests a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. So family background is low risk.\n\nBelief in God might provide moral guidance and social support, reducing criminal behavior, so that's another low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: age (medium), unemployment (medium), mental health (medium) are the main concerns. The rest are low. I think these factors balance out to a medium overall prediction, but considering the stabilizing factors like marriage and education, maybe the rearrest is less likely. So confidence might be around 60% for YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of fully developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"prior criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse can provide stability and reduce risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED indicates completion of basic education, offering better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is noted but not specified as heavy or problematic.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms may increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
