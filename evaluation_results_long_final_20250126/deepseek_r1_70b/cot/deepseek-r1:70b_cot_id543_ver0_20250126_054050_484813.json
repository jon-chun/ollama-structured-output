    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be influenced more by peers. So I'd rate age as high.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females. That\u2019s another high factor.\n\nOnly one arrest with no conviction. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, that might mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which could indicate a lower risk. So low for prior criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 220 lbs. While physical size can sometimes be a factor in certain crimes, on its own, it doesn\u2019t strongly correlate with recidivism. I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might indicate less stability. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a risk. So medium for marital status.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so I'll rate this medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job stability is important; frequent job changes could indicate instability or issues with employment, which is a risk factor. Medium here as well.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are both positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism, so their absence lowers the risk. Both factors are low.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor against delinquency, so that's good. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but since he had a stable household, maybe the impact is lessened. I'll rate this low.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and social support, which are positive factors. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and gender; medium are marital status and job instability; the rest are low. The higher number of low factors might counterbalance the mediums and highs. But since age is a strong predictor, I'm leaning towards a medium prediction with 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males historically show higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"prior criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower prior criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes could signal instability or issues with employment.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces recidivism risk factors.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers the likelihood of related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
