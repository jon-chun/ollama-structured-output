    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 20-year-old female over the next three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So that's probably a medium or high risk factor.\n\nShe's White, but I don't think race itself is a direct indicator of recidivism risk. It might relate to systemic factors, but without specific data linking race to higher recidivism in her context, I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction could mean less severe offense or first-time mistake, so maybe medium risk here because it shows some involvement with the law, but not a pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight are average, which doesn't really relate to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for reoffending. Maybe medium risk because of potential isolation or lack of stabilizing influences.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can lower recidivism by providing opportunities, so not being enrolled might increase risk slightly. Medium here since she does have a diploma, which is positive, but no higher education could limit her options.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it suggests potential issues with employment, which ties to recidivism. So medium or high? Maybe medium because frequent job changes might indicate instability but not necessarily criminal behavior.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism since it can lead to further offenses, especially if it's part of a pattern. However, it's only marijuana and she hasn't felt depressed recently. So maybe medium risk here because substance use is present but not more severe.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. Stable family background could be protective, so this might lower her risk. That's probably low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. I'm not sure how significant that is. Some studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism, but it's not a strong factor on its own. Maybe low here since the influence isn't present, but it's not a major risk indicator.\n\nPutting this all together: age (medium), arrest without conviction (medium), living alone and job instability (both medium), drug use (medium). The protective factors are stable upbringing and having a high school diploma. So overall, I think her risk is on the lower side because while there are several medium factors, they aren't extremely high. Maybe a 40% confidence she'll reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone isn't a significant predictor without contextual factors.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest suggests some legal involvement but not a pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate less social support, a potential risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education/employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is positive, but no college enrollment might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may signal instability affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a known risk factor for potential reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief isn't a strong predictor on its own.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
