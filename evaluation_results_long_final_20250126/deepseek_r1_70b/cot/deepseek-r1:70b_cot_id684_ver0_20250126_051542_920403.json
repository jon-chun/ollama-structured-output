    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old Hispanic male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peer groups. So I'll mark that as high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once before and has a conviction. A prior record is a strong indicator of recidivism, so that's definitely a high-risk factor too.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to criminal behavior, so I can consider that low risk.\n\nLiving alone might indicate instability or lack of support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. But it's not as significant as other factors, so medium risk seems right.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive because education can reduce recidivism. Not being in college isn't too bad since he has a job history. This factor leans towards low risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year, which shows instability or inability to maintain employment. Unstable employment is linked to higher recidivism, so medium risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is concerning. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, so high risk.\n\nNo recent depression is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism. That's a low-risk factor.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in a larger household might provide some stability, but not having a father figure could be a risk. However, family support is generally positive, so I'll go with medium risk.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might indicate some moral framework or support system, which can lower recidivism. So low risk there.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are age and prior conviction and drug use; medium are living alone, job instability, and family structure; lows are physical build, education, mental health, and religious beliefs. The higher number of high-risk factors makes me lean towards a prediction of YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19):** Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\n2. **Prior Arrest/Conviction:** A history of arrest and conviction is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\n3. **Drug Use:** Past substance abuse, especially with multiple drugs, is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n4. **Living Situation:** Living alone may indicate less support, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n5. **Employment Instability:** Frequent job changes can suggest instability, which might contribute to criminal behavior.\n6. **Family Structure:** Growing up without a father figure could pose some risk, though living with a biological parent is positive.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of multiple high-risk factors such as young age, prior conviction, and drug use significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_or_conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of arrest and conviction is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma reduces recidivism risk, though not being in college is neutral.\"),\n    (\"job_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a larger household may provide some stability but lacks a father figure.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God suggests moral framework, reducing recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
