Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's lower than someone with multiple arrests or convictions, so low risk here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of reoffending. High school diploma is positive too, showing some level of education. So these are both low risks.\n\nEmployment history: he held two jobs in a year. That could indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which might increase recidivism risk if he can't find steady work. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nDrug use: past marijuana use and recent use isn't specified, but occasional use is less concerning than frequent or hard drugs. Still, it's a factor, so low risk here.\n\nLiving in a large household as a child could mean instability, but without more info on neglect or abuse, I'll keep this low.\n\nFeeling down recently might indicate mental health issues which can increase recidivism if untreated. So medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. This might reduce religious-based support systems, so I see it as a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the main concerns are age and employment instability, but he has strong stabilizers like marriage and education. His mental health is a moderate concern. Overall, I think he's less likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, the individual is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests lower prior criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma indicates completion of basic education, a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in one year may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is less severe than other drugs; recent use isn't specified as frequent.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Living in a large household as a child without indicators of neglect suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence might reduce support, but isn't a strong factor alone.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
