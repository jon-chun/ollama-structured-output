    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger individuals are generally at higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and may be more impulsive. So that's probably a medium or high risk. I think medium makes sense here since 21 isn't extremely young but still in the higher-risk bracket.\n\nNext, criminal history: he's been arrested once but not convicted. That shows some involvement with the law, so it's a risk factor. But since there's no conviction, maybe it's on the lower side. I'll go with low for this one because the lack of a conviction might indicate it was a minor offense or not sustained.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 135 lbs. That makes him underweight. Physical build can sometimes be a factor in crime, but I'm not sure how significant it is here. Maybe being underweight isn't directly linked to recidivism, so perhaps low risk.\n\nMarital status: he's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships often reduce recidivism because they provide support and structure. That should be a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not in college. Having a diploma is good, but higher education can further reduce recidivism. Since he isn't enrolled, it might limit his opportunities, but the diploma itself is still positive. Maybe medium because while it's better than no diploma, not continuing could be a slight risk.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs this year. Stable employment is a strong protective factor against recidivism. Having multiple jobs suggests he's employable and responsible, so that should be low risk.\n\nSubstance abuse: hasn't used drugs in four years. That's a significant positive factor as substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism. So definitely low risk here.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Good mental health is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family environment reduces risk factors associated with broken homes or instability. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stable home life probably outweighs that. So maybe medium because of the urban setting but overall it's a protective factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has a role in his life. Religion can provide support and reduce recidivism through community and moral guidance. This is definitely a low risk or even a protective factor, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risks with a couple mediums. The overall prediction for rearrest seems low because the protective factors like stable marriage, employment, no substance abuse, and religious beliefs likely outweigh the few medium-risk factors like age and education level. So the confidence is around 65% that he won't be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of fully developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some involvement with the law but not a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Underweight may indicate potential health issues but is not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse indicates stability and support, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education could limit opportunities and slightly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment suggests responsibility and reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years significantly reduces recidivism risk associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates good mental health, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban area provides stability but urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide moral guidance and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
