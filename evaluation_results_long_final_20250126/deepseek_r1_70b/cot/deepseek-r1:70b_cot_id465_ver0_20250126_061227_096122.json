Her age could be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but being in college suggests she's engaged in positive activities.\n\nShe has a stable living situation and is pursuing education beyond high school, both of which are positive indicators. Employment history shows she's held two jobs recently, indicating responsibility. No drug use in four years and no recent depression lowers her risk profile further.\n\nHer upbringing with non-biological parents might introduce some instability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Spiritual beliefs can provide emotional support, which is generally positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors lean towards low recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young and may be associated with higher impulsivity and less life stability, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests minimal criminal involvement or propensity for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college indicates stability, motivation, and lower likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs in the past year shows some employment stability but may also indicate potential instability or job hopping.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk of substance-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the likelihood of mental health contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but could also suggest limited social support, which might increase risk factors if isolation leads to negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults at a young age in an urban area could indicate some instability or exposure to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God influences personal events may provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
