    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this individual to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So that's probably a medium or high factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Prior convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism, so this should be high.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that low.\n\nMarital status: never married. Singles might have less stability, but it's not as significant as other factors. Maybe medium.\n\nLiving alone could indicate instability or isolation, which can contribute to higher risk. That seems medium.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually reduces recidivism because it provides better opportunities. This should be low risk.\n\nEmployment: held one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a risk factor for recidivism, so this might be medium or high. Since he's only had one job, I'm leaning towards medium.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support drug habits. Definitely high risk.\n\nMental health: no depression recently. That's a positive sign, so low risk here.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family reduces risk, but urban environments might have higher crime rates. I'll consider this medium because the stable upbringing is good, but the environment could be a negative factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God influences his life. Religion can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, high factors are prior conviction and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, employment, family background. Lows are physical build, marital status, education, mental health, religion. The combination leans towards a higher risk, so prediction is YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young and may be associated with higher impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted once increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate social isolation or unstable living conditions.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have mixed influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
