    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So that's probably a medium or high risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might lower the risk compared to someone with multiple arrests or convictions, so maybe low for prior criminal history.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I can consider this as low impact.\n\nLiving alone could be a neutral factor since it doesn't indicate instability per se. So low again here.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive sign. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides structure and future opportunities, so that's definitely a low risk factor.\n\nHaving held three jobs in the past year suggests some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can be a risk factor for reoffending. Unstable employment is often linked to higher recidivism, so maybe medium here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years and recent use could indicate substance issues, which are known to increase recidivism risk. So this should be medium or high.\n\nFeeling down recently might point to mental health issues, but without more severe symptoms, it's probably a low factor unless it's linked to other behaviors that increase risk.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child with a large household could mean exposure to higher crime environments, so maybe a medium factor for environment.\n\nBelieving in God might provide a support system or positive influence, which is protective against recidivism, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together: age (medium), prior criminal history (low), employment instability (medium), drug use (medium). Other factors like education and beliefs are protective. So overall, the prediction leans towards YES but with moderate confidence because while there are some risk factors, there are also mitigating circumstances like being in school.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates due to impulsive behavior and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior criminal history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs in a year may indicate instability, which can correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but not as severe as harder drugs; still, it can influence behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Recent feelings of sadness are noted but without indication of severe mental illness requiring intervention.\"),\n    (\"environmental factors\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing in a large household might expose to higher crime rates or instability.\"),\n    (\"social support\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
