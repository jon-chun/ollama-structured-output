    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. At 21, he's still young, and studies show that younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors which can lead to criminal activity. So I might rate his age as a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it does pose some concern.\n\nNext, being male. Statistically, males have higher recidivism rates compared to females. This is another point towards a medium risk since gender alone isn't definitive but adds to the overall picture.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. People with criminal histories are more likely to reoffend, so I should consider this a high-risk factor.\n\nHis physical build is 6 feet 3 inches and between 175-199 lbs. While this might make him stand out, there's no direct correlation between physical size and recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes like assault. Without more context, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support or supervision, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. On the other hand, if he has a stable living situation, it could be neutral. But since he's young and lives alone, maybe medium risk because lack of supervision can lead to poor decisions.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is positive as education can reduce recidivism. However, not being enrolled in college might mean fewer opportunities or less engagement in positive activities. This could slightly increase his risk, so perhaps medium.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor and reduce recidivism. Having multiple jobs might indicate instability, but it's also a sign of employability. I'm leaning towards low risk here because employment generally is a protective factor against reoffending.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so his sobriety suggests lower risk, hence low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower his risk. However, if there's an underlying issue that's untreated, it could be a concern. I'll rate this as low for now.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is a protective factor. It suggests a supportive upbringing, which can reduce recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nBelief in God can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a deterrent to criminal behavior. This would be a low-risk factor as it's associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this all together: high factors are prior conviction, medium include age, gender, living situation, education, and job stability. The rest are low. The combination leans towards a higher risk, but not the highest. So I might predict YES for rearrest, but with moderate confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life experience.\"),\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of conviction increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical size and recidivism without specific context.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not attending college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Steady employment can reduce recidivism risk despite job changes.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs reduces recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can provide stabilizing influences and community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
