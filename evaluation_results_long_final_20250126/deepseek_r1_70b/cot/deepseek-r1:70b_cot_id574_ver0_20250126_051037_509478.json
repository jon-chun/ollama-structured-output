    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity or ongoing behavioral issues, but I'm not sure yet. Gender-wise, females generally have lower recidivism than males, so that might lean towards a lower risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without conviction could indicate a minor offense or a first-time mistake, which doesn't necessarily point to a high-risk behavior pattern. So maybe low risk here.\n\nHer physical attributes: 5'5\" and 135 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is unless we're considering physicality in crimes, but most crimes aren't dependent on height or weight, so I'll probably assign this a low impact.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single isn't inherently risky, but living alone might mean less social support, which could be a minor factor, but not too significant on its own. Maybe medium, but I'm leaning towards low because she's in college, so perhaps she has a stable environment despite living alone.\n\nEducation: high school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a strong indicator of lower recidivism. Being in college suggests she's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should be a protective factor against reoffending. High education usually means lower risk.\n\nEmployment history: held no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it's often linked with criminal behavior, either through drug-related crimes or impaired judgment leading to other offenses. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Not feeling depressed is positive; mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, this might lower her risk compared to someone with active mental health issues. So maybe low here.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area as a child. Stable family environment with both biological parents is usually protective. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with her mother suggests stability, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has something to do with her personal happenings. Religious engagement can be a protective factor against recidivism as it often provides a support system and moral framework. So this is likely a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She's got some positive factors like education, stable family background, and religious beliefs which are protective. The risks come from unemployment and substance use. Since she hasn't been convicted yet, that single arrest might not weigh too heavily. However, drug use is a significant concern. Unemployment could be mitigated by her being in college, as she's likely focused on studies rather than joblessness leading to crime.\n\nSo the main high-risk factor is drug use, which is significant, but other factors like education and lack of conviction might balance it out. I'm inclined to predict that she won't recidivate because the protective factors are strong, especially her educational engagement and stable background. Confidence-wise, considering the presence of drug use as a major risk, maybe around 65% confidence in 'NO' prediction.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Demographics (Age, Gender):** Young age can be risky due to impulsivity, but being female lowers recidivism likelihood.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** Single arrest without conviction suggests low risk.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes:** Irrelevant in this context.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Living alone is neutral; being a student might indicate stability.\n\n5. **Education:** High education is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\n\n6. **Employment History:** Unemployment can pose a risk but may be mitigated by college enrollment.\n\n7. **Substance Use:** Significant risk factor due to links with criminal behavior.\n\n8. **Mental Health:** Recent stability reduces risk.\n\n9. **Family Background:** Stable upbringing is protective.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Provides moral support, lowering risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** Protective factors like education and stable background outweigh the risks of unemployment and drug use, leading to a prediction of no recidivism with moderate confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity but is not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests minimal criminal history and low risk.\"),\n    (\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant factors in recidivism prediction.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married status is common at her age and does not indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest independence but lacks direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in a 4-year college indicates stability and lower recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held in the past year could indicate instability, though being enrolled might mitigate this.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to those with active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a small household indicates a stable upbringing, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
