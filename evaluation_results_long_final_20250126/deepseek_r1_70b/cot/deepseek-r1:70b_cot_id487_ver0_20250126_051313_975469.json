    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for a 21-year-old woman to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. At 21, she's young, and younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet.\n\nShe has two prior arrests but no convictions. Arrests without convictions can indicate either that the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could mean less severe offenses or insufficient evidence. Since there's no conviction, it's a lower risk factor compared to someone with a history of convictions.\n\nHer physical build is 5'2\" and 160 lbs. While not directly a major risk factor, being physically capable might relate to certain types of crimes, but without knowing the nature of her arrests, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this as low risk since there's no direct link provided.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support or stability, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. However, being unmarried at 21 isn't unusual, so the impact might not be significant on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education typically reduces recidivism risk as it provides skills and opportunities. This is a protective factor, so I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year, indicating some employment stability. Stable employment generally lowers recidivism risk because it provides structure and income. However, having multiple jobs might suggest instability if she changed jobs frequently, but since it's only two in a year, it seems manageable. I'll consider this as medium risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used most of the time last month. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and legal issues. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nShe reported feeling down most days recently, which points to potential mental health issues like depression. Mental health struggles can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is another high-risk factor.\n\nHer upbringing was stable with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background usually reduces risk factors, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has control over her life, which relates to lack of spiritual support. Some studies suggest that spirituality can reduce recidivism, so this absence might slightly increase her risk, but it's not a major factor on its own.\n\nPutting all together: young age (medium), prior arrests without conviction (low), stable job (medium), drug use (high), mental health issues (high), living alone (medium), and lack of spirituality (low). The high-risk factors are drug use and mental health, which are significant. However, her education and employment provide some protective elements.\n\nI think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest within three years, with a confidence around 70%. There's enough high-risk factors to make it likely, but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 is relatively young, and younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests without Conviction\", \"low\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest less severe or uncertain criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical build and criminal behavior in this context.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, a potential risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year could indicate some instability but also shows employability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"high\", \"Feeling down consistently can lead to impaired judgment and decision-making, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents suggests a stable upbringing, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"A lack of belief in divine control may reduce protective factors but is not a major risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
