    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors. So I would consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females, so her gender might lower her risk. That would probably be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Since she doesn't have any prior convictions, that's a good sign. It suggests maybe this was a one-time mistake or something that didn't result in a conviction, which could mean less likelihood of reoffending. So I'll mark prior record as low.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I can disregard that factor entirely.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some instability or lack of social support, but being unmarried at 21 is pretty common. I'm not sure if this is a significant risk factor, but maybe it's low since living alone doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with recidivism.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit her options. I think this could be a medium risk factor because without higher education or job training, she might face more challenges.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history can indicate stability, but having had two jobs might suggest some instability or difficulty maintaining employment. However, being employed at all is better than unemployment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So I might rate this as medium because while she has jobs, frequent changes could be a concern.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years. That's positive and reduces her risk factors related to substance abuse, so drug use would be low.\n\nShe felt down recently but not consistently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if they lead to self-medication or other risky behaviors. However, she only felt down some of the time, which might not be as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because mental health can still play a role even if it's intermittent.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is protective against recidivism, so this would be a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism by offering a sense of community and purpose. So her belief that God influences her life would likely lower her risk, making it a low factor.\n\nPutting all these together: medium factors are age, education level, employment history, and mental health. The rest are low. Since there's a mix but more lows than highs, the overall prediction is probably NO for rearrest within three years. Confidence might be around 65% because while some risks exist, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, she is in a higher risk demographic due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"As a female, she belongs to a demographic with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior record\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs indicates some stability, though frequent changes could signal instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces associated risks with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Intermittent feelings of sadness might indicate moderate mental health concerns.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
