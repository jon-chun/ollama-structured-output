    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. She's 20 years old. Research shows that younger offenders are more likely to recidivate because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet.\n\nNext, she's female. Generally, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, but that can vary based on other factors.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and conviction. A history of arrests is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. However, since it's only one, it might not be as high risk as multiple offenses.\n\nHer height and weight (5'4\", 115 lbs) don't directly indicate much about recidivism risk, so I'll consider that low impact.\n\nMarital status: being married can sometimes be a stabilizing factor. However, living alone might mean less social support, which could increase stress or isolation, potentially affecting behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to financial instability.\n\nEmployment history: she's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it might indicate difficulty maintaining steady work, which could relate to financial stress or other issues.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity.\n\nNo recent depression, which is positive because mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated. However, not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily mean there aren't other mental health factors at play.\n\nLiving situation as a child: she grew up with her biological mother in a household of size five. Larger family sizes can sometimes lead to less individual attention and resources, which might contribute to behavioral issues, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nReligious views: she doesn't believe God influences her life. Lower religious involvement is sometimes associated with higher recidivism, as religion can provide a support network and moral framework.\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks are her age, substance use, limited education, unstable employment, and living situation as a child. Her gender and marital status might lower the risk slightly. Overall, these factors lean towards a medium risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At 20 years old, she is in a high-risk age group for recidivism due to ongoing development and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"As a female, she statistically has a lower likelihood of recidivism compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest indicates some risk but isn't as concerning as multiple offenses.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes don't directly correlate with criminal behavior here.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married status may provide stability, though living alone could reduce social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma limits job opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job in a year suggests instability, potentially affecting financial stability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior recurrence.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Large household size might indicate less individualized support and resources.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce a potential protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
