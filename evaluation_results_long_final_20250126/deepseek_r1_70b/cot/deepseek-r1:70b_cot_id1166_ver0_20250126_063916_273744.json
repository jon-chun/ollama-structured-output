    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19, which is young. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive.\n\nNext, criminal history: four arrests and one conviction. That shows some involvement with the law, but it's not an extensive record yet. It leans towards medium risk since it's more than a couple of incidents but not excessive.\n\nLiving situation: he's living alone. This might indicate instability or lack of support, which can increase recidivism risk because he doesn't have a strong support system to help him stay on track.\n\nEducation and employment: he has a high school diploma and held one job in the past year. This is positive as having a diploma reduces recidivism, but only having one job suggests some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use isn't as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs, so this might be a lower risk compared to other substances.\n\nMental health: he felt down for parts of the past month. This indicates some mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if not addressed, but it's not severe enough to be high risk on its own.\n\nFamily background: lived with adoptive parents in an urban area. Stability from adoptive parents is positive, so this might lower his risk compared to those without a stable upbringing.\n\nReligious beliefs: he doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism as it might reduce a protective factor against reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together: young age and some criminal history are concerning, but factors like education and stable family background offset that a bit. However, living alone and mental health issues could tip the balance towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsive behavior and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Four arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement, but it's not an extensive record.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest instability or lack of support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective against recidivism; however, holding only one job in the past year suggests some instability.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is less strongly associated with recidivism compared to other drugs, but still a factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying issues that could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with adoptive parents in a stable household during youth is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"high\", \"A lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
