    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested twice, convicted once. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger offenders are generally at higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So that seems like a medium to high factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has one conviction. Two arrests in a short period suggest some criminal involvement, but it's not an extensive history yet. Maybe a medium risk here.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs, which doesn't seem relevant on its own unless there are health issues, but nothing indicates that. So low.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can increase recidivism risk because he lacks a stable home environment. That could be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism since it limits job opportunities. High risk factor here.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a big predictor; without a steady income, he might resort to crime again. So that's high.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to sustain the habit. Medium risk since it's not specified if he's currently using or addicted.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is positive, but mental health issues aren't indicated here. So low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, so medium risk.\n\nDoesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. Maybe low.\n\nPutting this together: high factors are education level and unemployment. Medium include age, arrests, living alone, drug use, and upbringing. Low factors are weight, mental health, and religion.\n\nOverall, the higher number of medium and some high-risk factors make me lean towards predicting recidivism. Confidence is around 75% because while there's a significant risk, some factors like no current depression or religious views might mitigate it slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, the individual is in a high-risk age group for criminal behavior due to ongoing brain development and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight of 140 lbs does not inherently indicate a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may suggest limited social support, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant predictor of recidivism as it limits employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year, which is strongly correlated with higher rates of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate substance-related issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing_and_environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a biological mother may not inherently increase risk but living in higher-crime areas could be a factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has nothing to do with personal events does not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
