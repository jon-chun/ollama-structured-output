    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So that's probably a medium or high risk.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males do have a higher recidivism rate than females. That could lean towards medium risk as well.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has one conviction. Three arrests in a short period suggest a pattern of behavior that might not be changing, so that seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't directly relate to recidivism, so I'll consider that low impact.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could indicate instability or lack of support, which might increase risk. But it's not as significant on its own, maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, so not pursuing higher education might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHaving two jobs in the past year shows some stability and responsibility, which is a positive sign. That would lower his risk, perhaps to low.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, in the past four years and recent months. Drug use is linked with higher recidivism, so that's a high-risk factor.\n\nFeeling down lately could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated can increase recidivism risk. So that's another medium or high factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of seven might suggest less individual attention or more stress, but it's not a strong indicator on its own\u2014maybe low impact.\n\nBelieving in God can be protective; religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism. That would mitigate risk, so low.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are prior arrests/convictions and drug use. Mental health is a medium factor. Age and gender add to the risk but maybe not as much. Employment history and religion are positive. So overall, I think the prediction leans towards YES with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females, though this can vary widely.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests/Convictions (3 arrests, 1 conviction)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may not be changing, which is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight (6'1\\\", 215 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical size does not have a direct correlation with recidivism risk unless linked to specific offenses.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Never married)\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with instability, though it's not a strong independent predictor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate social isolation or lack of support structures, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (High school diploma, not in college)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, though not pursuing further education may limit stabilizing opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History (2 jobs in the past year)\", \"low\", \"Having held multiple jobs suggests some level of stability and employability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana use in past four years and recent months)\", \"high\", \"Substance use is a well-known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and increase criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (Felt down recently)\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, which might increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Household Size in Youth (7 people)\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may have various effects but isn't a strong independent risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs (Believes God influences personal events)\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
