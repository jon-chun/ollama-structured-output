    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they're still developing and might not have stable life structures yet. So that seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, criminal history. He's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without conviction could indicate some involvement in risky behavior, so I'll mark that as low since it's only an arrest, not a conviction.\n\nLiving situation: he's living alone. This might mean less support or supervision, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So medium risk here.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism. That's a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment history: Held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which is another risk for reoffending. So medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase recidivism chances. I'll categorize this as medium.\n\nMental health: No depression reported recently. That's a positive sign, so low risk here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his biological mother in a large household (size 6) in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, and a larger family could mean less individual attention. This is a medium risk factor because it relates to environment and support structures.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God influences personal events. Religion can sometimes provide a supportive framework and reduce recidivism, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. I'll consider this as low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the higher risk factors like education and employment, along with medium factors such as age, living alone, drug use, and family background, suggest there's a notable likelihood of rearrest. However, the absence of mental health issues and some mitigating factors like religious beliefs might lower the overall risk slightly.\n\nI'm about 65% confident in this assessment because while several factors point towards a higher risk, some elements like no prior convictions and stable mental health provide some balance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited prior involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support or supervision.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability in employment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance-related issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in a rural area might have limited resources and support.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide stabilizing effects.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
