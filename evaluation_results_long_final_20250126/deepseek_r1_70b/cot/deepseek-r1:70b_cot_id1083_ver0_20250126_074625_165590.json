Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So that's probably a medium or high factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests aren't too bad, but having a conviction shows he's had more serious issues with the law. That might be a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't really indicate much about recidivism, so I'll consider that low.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single and living alone could mean less social support, which is linked to higher recidivism. So maybe medium risk there.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities, so that's probably high.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism since it can lead to financial instability. That should be high as well.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as severe as other drugs, but any drug use can indicate issues. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. That's a positive sign, so low risk there.\n\nLiving situation as a child: household of 11 is quite large, which might indicate instability or neglect. That could be a medium risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God influences his life. Religion can sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism, but it depends on how it's used. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the high-risk factors are education and employment, which are strong predictors. Medium factors include age, prior conviction, living alone, drug use, and household size. Low factors are physical build, mental health, marital status, and religion.\n\nSo overall, with two high factors and several mediums, I think he's at a medium risk for recidivism. His education and employment issues are significant, but other factors might balance it out a bit. Confidence is around 65% because while there are clear risks, some areas like mental health and religion could mitigate them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and lower life stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests/convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history but not an extensive one.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight (5'11\\\" and 200-224 lbs) do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may suggest limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education/employment\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and no employment in the past year are strong predictors of recidivism due to limited opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a concern but not as severe as other drugs; however, it still indicates potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health factors.\"),\n    (\"household size/childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of 11 may indicate instability or neglect, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God could provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
