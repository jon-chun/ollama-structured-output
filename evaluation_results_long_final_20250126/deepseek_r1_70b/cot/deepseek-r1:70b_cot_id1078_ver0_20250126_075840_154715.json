    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger people, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because of impulsive behavior and still developing decision-making skills. So that seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times already. That's quite a high number for someone so young. Prior arrests are a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has a conviction, which shows that some of those arrests led to actual convictions. A history of convictions increases the likelihood of reoffending, so that's another high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't particularly stand out as risk factors related to recidivism, so I can consider that low or maybe not a significant factor at all. Probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can sometimes provide stability, so not being married might indicate a lack of such support. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, which is a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college suggests limited education. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism because there are fewer opportunities for stable employment. That's another high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that's high risk as well.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, but not other drugs mentioned. While drug use is a risk factor, marijuana alone at this level might be moderate rather than high. It could contribute, but maybe it's not the most significant compared to other factors here.\n\nNo recent depression is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed recently lowers that particular risk. That would be low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lower religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, but I'm not sure how strong this factor is compared to others. Maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting all these together: high-risk factors include prior arrests, convictions, lack of education, unemployment. Medium ones are age, living situation, urban upbringing. Low risks are physical build, recent mental health, and religious beliefs.\n\nSo collectively, with multiple high-risk factors, the prediction for rearrest is YES with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests (10 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction history\", \"high\", \"A conviction suggests past offenses serious enough for legal action.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less support and supervision.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit employment opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history (unemployed)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is linked to higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a contributing factor but not as severe as other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risk.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement has a weaker correlation with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
