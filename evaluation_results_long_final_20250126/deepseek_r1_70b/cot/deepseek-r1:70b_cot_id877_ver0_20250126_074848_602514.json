    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more prone to risky behaviors. So I'll mark that as high.\n\nNext, gender is male. Statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females, so medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. The fact that he hasn't been convicted yet might mean less exposure to the criminal justice system, which could lower his likelihood of reoffending, so low risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so I'll consider this as low impact, maybe even negligible, so low risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Not being married can sometimes indicate less stable social support, but living alone doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with recidivism. I think this is a medium factor because the absence of a spouse might mean less stability, but it's not as significant on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education generally reduces recidivism risk by providing better opportunities and structure, so this should be low risk.\n\nEmployment: held one job in the past year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate some instability or short-term work, which could be a medium risk factor because it's not as stable as longer-term employment.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive indicator; substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so this should be low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed lately, that's a lower risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is a protective factor against delinquency and recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nHis religious views don't indicate much impact on recidivism; some studies show mixed results, but it's not a strong predictor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors are age 22 (high), male gender (medium). Low factors include arrest without conviction, education, no drug use, stable upbringing, and mental health. The employment is medium because having only one job might be less stable. So overall, the higher risks are somewhat mitigated by positive factors like education and lack of substance abuse.\n\nI think the prediction leans towards low recidivism risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At 22 years old, he is within a high-risk age range for recidivism as younger individuals are more prone to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Being male statistically increases the likelihood of recidivism compared to female counterparts.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job indicates some employment history but lacks long-term stability.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers the risk, as mental health issues can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence does not strongly correlate with increased recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
