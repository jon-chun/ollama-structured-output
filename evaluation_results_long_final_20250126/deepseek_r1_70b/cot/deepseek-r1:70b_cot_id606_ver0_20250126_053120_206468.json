    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. He's 19, which is young. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'd rate this as high.\n\nNext, his criminal history shows two arrests and one conviction. That's notable but not extensive. A medium rating seems appropriate here since it's not a long history, but it does indicate some involvement with the law.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 168 lbs., which is average build. There's no indication that his physical characteristics would pose an unusual risk, so I'll consider this low.\n\nLiving alone might contribute to higher risk because he lacks supervision or support that could help in rehabilitation. That feels like a medium factor.\n\nHis educational background includes a GED but no college enrollment. While having a GED is better than nothing, not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nUnemployment for the past year is concerning because lack of stable employment can lead to criminal activity out of necessity or boredom. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over four years, is present. While not the most severe drug, consistent use can impair judgment and increase recidivism risk. I'll consider this medium since it's not as severe as harder drugs but still a factor.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism, so being free of depression lowers this risk to low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area could have mixed effects. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but a stable family background could be protective. I'll lean towards low here since the stability likely outweighs the location's risks.\n\nFinally, his belief in God can be a protective factor as it may provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism risk. So this is another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and unemployment; medium include criminal history, living alone, education, and drug use; lows are build, recent mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. The higher number of medium and high factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of fully developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement, but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose an unusual risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and supervision, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but lack of college enrollment might limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held in the past year suggests instability and potential desperation that could lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use over four years indicates some substance involvement, which can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk associated with mental health issues leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household during childhood is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and support, reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
