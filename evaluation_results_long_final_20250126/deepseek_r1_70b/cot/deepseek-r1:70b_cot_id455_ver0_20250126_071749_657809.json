    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger offenders tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate this as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women generally have lower recidivism rates than men, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's White, but race itself isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior, so I won't weigh this too heavily\u2014maybe ignore it or consider it low.\n\nShe has one arrest but no convictions. Since she hasn't been convicted yet, that might mean she doesn't have a history of more serious offenses. This could lower her risk, so maybe medium because an arrest shows some involvement, but without conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living with others might provide more stability and support, which can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHaving a high school diploma and being in a graduate program is positive. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides better opportunities and stability. That would be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate some issues, but having multiple jobs might also show she's employable. Maybe medium risk here since frequent job changes can sometimes relate to instability.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a red flag because substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nNo recent depression is good, so mental health might not be an issue here\u2014low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents as a child in an urban area of six people could mean a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but her family stability likely offsets that, making this low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so considering God's influence would be a positive factor\u2014low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are drug use; medium are age and job instability; the rest are low. Drug use is a strong indicator, but her stable background and education might counterbalance that. I'm leaning towards predicting no recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a direct indicator of criminal propensity, though socioeconomic factors correlated with race can play a role.
