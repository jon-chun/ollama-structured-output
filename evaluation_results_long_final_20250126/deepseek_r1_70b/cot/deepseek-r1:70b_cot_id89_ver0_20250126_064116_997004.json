    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'd consider age as a medium factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests without convictions can still indicate some level of involvement in risky behavior, so prior arrests are probably a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so physical build is likely low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending because he doesn't have others to hold him accountable or provide stability. That feels like a medium factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk.\n\nHaving only one job in the past year suggests some instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment is linked to higher recidivism, so that's probably medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression are both positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism, so these would be low factors.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in a stable household is protective against delinquency, so family environment is low risk.\n\nLiving in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates or environments that could influence behavior, which could be medium.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. So religion would be low.\n\nPutting it all together: several medium factors like age, prior arrests, living alone, and unstable employment might push the risk up, but the presence of protective factors like stable family background, education, no substance use, and religious beliefs could mitigate that. I'm leaning towards a medium overall prediction with about 55% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate some engagement with the criminal justice system but not necessarily a pattern of serious offending.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and accountability, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, but having only one job in the past year could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years suggests lower risk related to substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the likelihood of mental health-related recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective against delinquency.\"),\n    (\"neighborhood\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime rates and exposure to criminogenic environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```",
