    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could be more impulsive. So I'll mark that as high.\n\nHe's been arrested nine times already. That's a significant number for someone so young. A history of multiple arrests suggests a pattern of behavior that could continue, putting this factor in the high category.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, I don't see physical size alone as a strong predictor of recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Being unmarried isn't a huge factor, but living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can be a risk. However, it's not the strongest indicator, so medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. High risk here.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. Definitely high risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces mental health-related risks. Both factors are low.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 14 in an urban area with his biological mother. While living in a large family might have its challenges, having a stable caregiver like his mom could provide some support. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but the presence of a biological parent might mitigate that risk a bit. So medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors like young age, multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment; medium factors include living situation and upbringing; low factors are size, no drug use, mental health, and religious beliefs. The high-risk elements seem to outweigh the others, leading me to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At 19 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for recidivism due to ongoing brain development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"Nine prior arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, suggesting a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"While his size might be intimidating, physical stature alone isn't a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital ties may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits employment opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year suggests financial instability, a known factor linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse history\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs for four years reduces this risk factor significantly.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers mental health-related risks that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background and upbringing\", \"medium\", \"A large household in an urban area might pose challenges, but living with his biological mother provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
