    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big factor in recidivism. Young people, especially those in their late teens, are at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be influenced more by peers. So I'm leaning towards high for the age factor.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females. That's another point towards a medium risk since gender alone isn't the strongest predictor but does contribute.\n\nOnly one arrest with no conviction is interesting. Since he hasn't been convicted yet, that might mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which could indicate a lower severity offense. So I think this factor should be low because it shows maybe a first-time or minor issue without a criminal record.\n\nHis physical build is 5'6\" and 178 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side but not extremely so. I don't see height or weight as significant risk factors here, so low seems appropriate.\n\nLiving alone could mean less stability or support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending because he doesn't have others to monitor his behavior. So medium risk there.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism; having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit opportunities, leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, but only having one job might indicate some instability or short-term work, so maybe medium here.\n\nDrug use is marijuana within the last four years. Marijuana is less serious than other drugs, and it's quite common. However, any drug use can impair judgment and increase risk. I'll go with medium for substance abuse.\n\nHe didn't report feeling depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can increase recidivism if unaddressed. So low risk on mental health.\n\nFamily background: living with his biological mother in a stable household of four suggests support and stability, reducing the risk factors associated with broken homes or neglect. Low risk here.\n\nReligious beliefs can have a protective effect by providing a moral framework and community support. So low risk for this factor as well.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm considering each factor's weight but overall, despite some medium risks like age and gender, the lack of conviction and stable upbringing might lower his recidivism chances. But since he's young and has some risk factors, there's still a moderate chance. I'll predict YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is a known risk factor for recidivism, though not as significant as other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history and possibly a minor offense.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong indicators of recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability but may also indicate job instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but still a risk factor for impaired judgment and behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a stable household suggests supportive environment.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral framework and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
