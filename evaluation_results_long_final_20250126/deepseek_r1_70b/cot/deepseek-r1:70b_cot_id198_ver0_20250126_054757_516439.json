    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old male. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big factor. He's young, 22, which is still considered part of late adolescence. Studies show that younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, which can increase the chance of recidivism. So I think his age should be a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Two arrests mean there's some history, but it's not an extensive record yet. The conviction shows that at least one of those arrests led to a guilty verdict, so that does indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending compared to someone with no convictions. I'm leaning towards medium here because while two arrests aren't too many, the fact that he was convicted once suggests some risk.\n\nHis physical build is 5'8\" and 145 lbs. That's pretty average, maybe even on the lighter side for his height. There's not much research linking body type directly to recidivism, so I don't think this should be a significant factor. Maybe low or medium, but probably low since it doesn't stand out as a risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor because having a strong support system often helps reduce recidivism. Never being married could indicate some instability in personal life, but I'm not sure how much weight to give that. Maybe medium because it's a minor indicator.\n\nHe has a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides better opportunities and stability. This seems like a protective factor, so probably low risk here.\n\nHe held one job during the past year. Employment can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, having a job can provide structure and reduce criminal behavior; on the other hand, only holding one job might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase stress and lead to recidivism. I think this is more of a medium risk because it's not clear if he has steady employment.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, especially if he continues using or has dependency issues. This should be high on the list.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues like depression are linked to higher recidivism rates, so not feeling depressed might lower that risk. But since it's only in the past month, I'm cautious. Maybe medium because it's a recent assessment but could change.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in a stable household is a protective factor. Stable family environments are associated with lower recidivism rates, so this should be low risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life, which can indicate a support system or positive outlook. Religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism because they provide moral guidance and community support. So that's another protective factor, probably low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age and drug use; medium includes prior conviction, living situation, job instability; lows are physical build, education, mental health, family background, religion. The combination leans towards a higher risk because the significant factors like age and drug use are strong predictors. So I'd say there's a higher likelihood he might reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, a minor risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year might suggest instability, posing some risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression, but only assessed for one month.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
