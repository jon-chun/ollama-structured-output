    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict if he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peers. So that's probably a medium or high risk. I'm leaning towards medium because he's enrolled in school, which might indicate some stability.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't too bad, but it does show he's had run-ins with the law. This is a moderate risk factor, so maybe medium.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and between 225-249 lbs. That makes him overweight or obese. Health issues could be a concern, but how does that relate to recidivism? Maybe it affects his mobility or mental health indirectly. Not sure if this is a significant factor on its own, so I'll consider it low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can increase risk. But being unmarried at 19 isn't unusual. This seems like a moderate risk, maybe medium.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school\u2014this is positive. Education usually reduces recidivism by providing structure and opportunities. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher recidivism if he can't maintain steady work. That seems like a medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as high-risk as other drugs, but any drug use can be a factor. Recent use? Not sure, but it's mentioned as past, so maybe low to medium. I think I'll go with medium because substance use is a known risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this might be a lower risk. So low here.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable family background is positive, so that would lower the risk. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, but living with both parents is a protective factor. Maybe medium because of the urban environment, but overall it's probably a lower risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism by giving a sense of purpose. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: age (medium), criminal history (medium), weight (low), living situation (medium), education (low), employment (medium), drug use (medium), mental health (low), family background (medium), religion (low). \n\nMost factors are medium, but some positive ones like school and religion might lower the overall risk. I think the prediction is more towards not being rearrested because of these positives. So prediction is NO with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence, but enrollment in school may mitigate this.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some legal issues but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"While health concerns exist, it's not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone suggests less social support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school is a positive indicator for lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability may indicate challenges in maintaining steady work, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a known risk factor but not as severe as other substances.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health status.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might pose risks, but living with both parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
