    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old Black male who was arrested once but not convicted. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big one. Younger people, especially those under 20, are statistically more likely to reoffend because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So I'd rate that as high risk.\n\nHe's male, and historically males have higher recidivism rates than females, so that's another point towards medium risk.\n\nOnly one arrest with no conviction is a lower concern compared to multiple arrests or prior convictions. That leans more towards low risk.\n\nLiving alone could mean less stability or support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. So I'd consider that medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests he might have limited opportunities and higher stress, so that's a medium risk factor too.\n\nHaving two jobs in a year shows some stability, but it's not consistent long-term employment. Maybe medium here as well because job instability can contribute to recidivism.\n\nNo drug use for four years is a positive sign; substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism, so that should be low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good, mental health issues often correlate with higher risk, so low again.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child could expose him to higher crime environments, which might increase his risk. I'll say medium for that.\n\nBelieving in God or a higher power can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a protective factor, meaning low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some high-risk factors like age and gender, the protective factors like no drug use and religious beliefs might lower his overall risk. I'm leaning towards predicting he won't be rearrested within three years with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19):** High risk due to younger age being associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Gender (Male):** Medium risk as males historically have higher recidivism than females.\n\n3. **Arrests/Convictions:** Low risk from one arrest and no conviction, indicating lower criminal history.\n\n4. **Living Situation:** Medium risk due to living alone, suggesting less support or stability.\n\n5. **Education Level:** Medium risk without a diploma, potentially limiting opportunities.\n\n6. **Employment History:** Medium risk with two jobs in a year, indicating possible instability.\n\n7. **Substance Abuse:** Low risk with no drug use in four years.\n\n8. **Mental Health:** Low risk from no recent depression.\n\n9. **Childhood Environment:** Medium risk from urban upbringing, possibly higher exposure to crime.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** Low risk as belief can provide support and reduce recidivism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile there are high-risk factors like age and medium factors such as gender and education, protective elements like no drug use and religious beliefs lower the overall risk. The prediction leans towards no rearrest with 65% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, particularly those under 20, are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males historically exhibit higher recidivism rates compared to females, contributing to a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"low\", \"Having only one arrest with no conviction suggests lower criminal history and reduced likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support and stability, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and increase stress, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in a year suggests some instability, which could be a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk of recidivism associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers the risk, as mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
