    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual regarding a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19, which is young. Younger individuals are generally at higher risk due to impulsive behavior and ongoing development. So that's high risk.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates than males, so this leans towards low risk.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate a lower likelihood of reoffending since it wasn't severe enough for a conviction. That\u2019s medium.\n\nHeight and weight (5'4\", 110 lbs) don\u2019t directly correlate with recidivism, so I'll consider that low impact.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean instability or lack of support, which might increase risk. So medium.\n\nGED certificate without college enrollment shows she has basic education but isn't pursuing higher education, which can limit opportunities and increase recidivism chances. That's high.\n\nHeld one job in a year suggests some stability but maybe not a strong work history, so medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is a red flag. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism. High risk here.\n\nRecent depression symptoms are concerning because mental health issues can lead to recidivism if unaddressed. That's high.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child is generally stable, which is protective, so low.\n\nBelieving in God might provide emotional support and reduce recidivism, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors: several high risks like age, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable living situation. However, being female and having a stable upbringing are protective. The high-risk factors seem to outweigh the low ones, leading me to predict YES for recidivism with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Age (19):** Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing recidivism likelihood.\n\n2. **Gender (Female):** Lower recidivism rates compared to males; protective factor.\n\n3. **Arrest History:** One arrest without conviction suggests lower severity or first-time offense, indicating medium risk.\n\n4. **Living Situation:** Living alone at 19 may reflect instability or lack of support, increasing risk.\n\n5. **Education (GED):** Basic education without further enrollment can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\n\n6. **Employment (One job in a year):** Indicates some stability but not a strong employment history; medium risk.\n\n7. **Drug Use:** Marijuana and cocaine use is linked to higher recidivism rates due to potential dependency and related behaviors.\n\n8. **Mental Health:** Recent depression symptoms can impair judgment and increase recidivism if untreated.\n\n9. **Family Background:** Stable upbringing with both parents is protective, lowering risk.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs:** May provide support but isn't a strong standalone factor; medium impact.\n\n**Conclusion:** High-risk factors such as young age, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable living situation outweigh the protective factors of gender and stable upbringing, leading to a prediction of YES with 65% confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female individuals generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate a first-time or less severe offense.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age could indicate instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Having only a GED and not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job in the past year suggests some stability but limited work history.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine increases the likelihood of recidivism due to potential dependency and related behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Recent symptoms of depression could impair judgment and increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support but isn't a strong predictor on its own.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
