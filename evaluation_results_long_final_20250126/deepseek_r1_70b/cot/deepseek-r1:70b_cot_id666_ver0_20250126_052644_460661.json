    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could still be influenced by peer groups or impulsive behaviors. So I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nHe's male, which statistically is associated with a higher likelihood of criminal behavior compared to females. That's another point towards medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested twice before and has one conviction. Prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future recidivism because they indicate a pattern of behavior. Two arrests aren't extremely high, but it's enough to be concerning, so I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nHis physical build is 5'9\" and 140 lbs, which isn't particularly unusual or indicative of criminal tendencies on its own. I don't see this as a significant factor either way, so low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but living alone at 18 might not be uncommon. However, lack of strong social ties could contribute to higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive factor. Education often provides structure and opportunities, which can reduce recidivism. This should lower his risk, so low.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is linked to higher recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. That's a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is concerning. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive, but mental health issues can fluctuate. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might lower his risk compared to someone struggling with current mental health issues, so low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in an urban area of size four could provide stability, which is a protective factor against recidivism. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, but family support might mitigate that. I'll consider this medium risk.\n\nBelieving God has a role in his life can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism through religious support networks. That's another positive factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are age, unemployment, drug use; medium include gender, prior record, living situation, family background; lows are build, education, mental health, religion. The presence of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, positive factors like schooling and religious beliefs might offset some risks. Confidence is around 70% for a YES prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of fully developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males statistically have a higher likelihood of criminal behavior compared to females.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between physical build and criminal recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"current_enrollment_in_school\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school provides structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates due to financial instability and increased criminal activity likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk compared to individuals with current mental health struggles.\"),\n    (\"family_background_and_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents provides stability, but urban environments may have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide purpose and reduce recidivism through support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
