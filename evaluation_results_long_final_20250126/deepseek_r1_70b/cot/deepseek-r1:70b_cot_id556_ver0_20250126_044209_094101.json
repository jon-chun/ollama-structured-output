    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have the maturity or stable life circumstances to avoid criminal behavior. So, I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has one conviction. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could be concerning. However, since he's young, it might also be situational rather than a deep-seated issue. I think this is a high risk factor because prior offenses are strong predictors.\n\nHis physical stature\u20145'10\" and 140 lbs\u2014is average and not particularly underweight or overweight. I don't see this as a significant risk factor either way, so low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married. Being single can sometimes correlate with less stability, but at 18, it's common. Not a major factor on its own, so maybe medium. However, considering his age and that many people his age aren't married, perhaps this isn't too significant. Maybe low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, which might increase risk. Alternatively, he could be managing independence well. I'm leaning towards medium here because living alone at 18 without a strong support system might pose some challenges.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing structure and opportunities. So this should be a low risk factor as it's protective.\n\nEmployment history: held one job in the past year. Having some employment shows responsibility but not a stable work history yet. This could be a medium risk since inconsistent employment can lead to instability, which might increase recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nRecent feelings of depression: feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, might increase recidivism. However, if he's getting help or coping well, the risk might be lower. I'll rate this medium because mental health can influence behavior but isn't as direct as drug use.\n\nLiving situation as a child: lived with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might contribute to higher risk. But having a stable family unit (with mom) could mitigate some of that. Maybe medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: considering God's influence can provide a sense of purpose or support, which is protective against recidivism. So this would be a low risk factor as it can act as a positive influence.\n\nPutting all these together, the higher risks are prior convictions, drug use, and maybe living alone and employment history. The protective factors are education and religion. So overall, there's a moderate to high risk of rearrest, but not extremely high because he has some positive elements in his life like school enrollment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential immaturity and lack of stable life circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly correlate with criminal recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Being single at 18 is common and doesn't strongly indicate higher risk without other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age might indicate less support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school provides structure and reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Limited employment history suggests potential instability but shows some responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for impaired judgment and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Depressive feelings could influence behavior, though not as direct as substance use.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might pose challenges but stable family background mitigates some risks.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
