    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger people, especially those in their early twenties, are statistically more likely to be impulsive and engage in risky behavior, which can increase recidivism chances. So I might lean towards medium here because it's not too young but still within a higher-risk bracket.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests without convictions could mean that either the charges were dropped or she's awaiting trial. However, multiple arrests do indicate some level of involvement in activities that lead to law enforcement attention. I'm thinking this is a medium risk factor because it shows a pattern even if there are no convictions yet.\n\nHer height is 5'7\", which is average for an adult female. I don't see how her physical stature would directly influence recidivism, so maybe low or not significant at all. Maybe it's just extra info without much bearing on the risk assessment.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but not always. Living alone might mean less social support, which could contribute to higher risk if she doesn't have others to monitor her behavior or provide guidance. I'm leaning towards medium here because it indicates a lack of strong social bonds that might deter criminal activity.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a significant factor; lower educational attainment often correlates with higher recidivism rates. It can limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability which may drive individuals to crime. This seems like a high risk factor because without education, her options are limited.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without steady income, she might turn to illegal activities out of necessity or boredom. Definitely a high risk factor here.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be linked to criminal behavior, either through drug-related crimes or impaired judgment leading to other offenses. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe medium risk? It's still a substance that can affect decision-making but isn't as directly criminogenic as others.\n\nShe didn\u2019t feel depressed last month. Mental health issues often play a role in recidivism, but the absence of recent depression might mean she\u2019s more stable now. However, without info on other mental health factors or past issues, it's hard to gauge. Maybe low risk because current mental state seems okay.\n\nLived with biological mother in a small household as a child. Stable family environments are protective against recidivism. Growing up with both parents can provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this would be a low risk factor since it's a positive aspect.\n\nBelieves God influences her personal events. Religious beliefs can have a positive impact by providing moral guidance and social support, which might lower recidivism rates. So I\u2019d consider this a low risk factor as well because it could act as a protective element.\n\nNow, putting all these together: the high risk factors are lack of education and unemployment. Medium risks include age, arrests without convictions, living alone, and drug use. Low risks are her height, stable upbringing, mental health status, and religious beliefs.\n\nThe high and medium factors might tip the prediction towards a higher likelihood of rearrest, especially since employment and education are strong predictors. However, she hasn't been convicted yet, which is a positive sign. Also, having a supportive family background and religious beliefs could mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm thinking the overall risk might be on the lower side because despite some high-risk factors like unemployment and lack of education, she has protective factors that could help her avoid recidivism. So maybe I'd predict a low chance of rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher-risk age bracket for impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrests without convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate potential involvement in risky activities.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"5'7\\\" is average and doesn't impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits job opportunities, increasing financial instability risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to criminal activity due to financial necessity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use affects judgment but is less criminogenic than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests current stability.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide moral guidance and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
