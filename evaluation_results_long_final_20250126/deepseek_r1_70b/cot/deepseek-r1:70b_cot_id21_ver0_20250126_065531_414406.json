    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills and could still be influenced by peer groups or impulsive behaviors. So I would rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has one conviction. A history of multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, indicates a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might have ongoing issues with the law, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't directly relate to recidivism, but being overweight could indicate possible health issues or lifestyle factors. However, without more context on how this affects his behavior, I'll consider it low risk.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. So this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHaving a GED is positive because it shows he has some education, which can help with employment. Not being enrolled in college isn't necessarily negative on its own, but it might limit his future opportunities. I'll rate education as medium risk because while having a GED is good, not pursuing further education could hinder his long-term stability.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment instability can be a risk factor for recidivism because it may indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which can lead to financial stress and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this is medium risk.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years and some recent use, is concerning but not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can impair judgment and increase recidivism risk. I'll rate substance abuse as medium.\n\nFeeling down recently could indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems are linked to higher recidivism rates because they might lead to self-medication or poor decision-making. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size four isn't inherently risky, but it depends on the family environment. Without more info on neglect or abuse, I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHis belief in God can be a protective factor, providing a moral framework and support system. Religious beliefs are often associated with lower recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he has high risks from his criminal history and mental health issues, mediums from age, education, employment, and drug use. The protective factors like marriage and religion might mitigate some risk but not enough to outweigh the higher concerns. So I predict a YES for recidivism with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"No direct link to recidivism without additional context on health or lifestyle impact.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can provide emotional support, reducing risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED is positive but lack of college enrollment may limit future stability.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could lead to financial stress and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is concerning but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Depression can lead to poor decisions or self-medication, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"No inherent risk without neglect/abuse context.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse.
