    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, age: 21 is relatively young, but not in the very high-risk teen years. Younger offenders do have higher recidivism rates, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, criminal history: He has four arrests and one conviction. That's significant because prior offenses are a strong predictor of future crimes. Four arrests show a pattern, so I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 190 lbs. While weight can sometimes relate to health issues, without more context on behavior or aggression tied to size, this might be low risk.\n\nLiving alone: No stable family support could mean less supervision or support, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education usually reduces recidivism, so having a diploma is positive, making this a low risk.\n\nEmployment history: Three jobs in a year could indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which is linked to higher recidivism. I'd consider this medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe medium risk.\n\nMental health: No depression reported, so that's a positive sign. Low risk here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents as a child in an urban area. Stable family is protective; urban areas might have higher crime rates, but stable upbringing could offset that. Maybe low risk overall.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God influences his life. Religion can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is likely a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, high-risk factors like criminal history and medium ones like living alone and unstable employment suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest. But positives like education and religion might lower the risk a bit. I'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is young but not in the highest-risk teenage bracket.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma reduces recidivism risk compared to those without one.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but still indicates substance use, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents as a child provides stability and reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
