    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted once. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be influenced more by peers. So I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe's male, and statistics show that males have higher recidivism rates than females. That's another high-risk factor.\n\nTwo arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history. While it's not an extensive record, having a conviction does pose a moderate risk. I'll go with medium here.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 275 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, by itself, size isn't directly linked to recidivism. So low risk.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships often provide support and reduce criminal behavior, so that's a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is good because education can reduce recidivism, but not being in college might limit his opportunities. Medium risk.\n\nHolding two jobs in the past year shows some stability and employability, which is positive. So low risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the last four years is concerning. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism, so high risk.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign as mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. Low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child could have mixed effects. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but a stable family background is protective. I'll rate this medium.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age, gender, drug use; mediums are criminal history, education, family environment; lows are physical size, marital status, employment, mental health, religious beliefs. The higher number of high-risk factors suggests a likelihood of rearrest. I'm about 80% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"At 20 years old, young offenders are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males historically have higher rates of recidivism compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Size alone isn't a direct indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse suggests stability and support.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive, but lack of college enrollment may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs shows employability and some stability.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family upbringing in an urban area has mixed implications.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
