    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and could be more influenced by peers. So that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's male, which statistically is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to females. That would be another high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which increases the likelihood of reoffending. So that's also high.\n\nHis height and weight don't particularly stand out as risk factors; maybe low or medium, but not a major concern here. I'll go with low since it doesn't directly relate to recidivism much.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might mean less social support, which could increase risk. Living alone might also indicate isolation or lack of supervision. That seems medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal activity. So that's a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor since it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is strongly correlated with recidivism because substances can impair judgment and are often linked to criminal behavior. So that's high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean mental health isn't a current issue, but I'm not sure how much that impacts recidivism compared to other factors. Maybe low risk in this context since it's not indicating a problem right now.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area of size three. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, so that might be a medium risk factor because of environmental influences.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, but it's not as strong a factor as others. Maybe low or medium; I'll go with medium since some studies suggest religion can provide support.\n\nPutting all these together: high-risk factors include age, gender, criminal history, education level, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors are marital status, living situation, religious beliefs. Low factors are physical build and mental health state.\n\nSo overall, the risk is quite high for recidivism. I'd say a 75% confidence in predicting he will be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Statistical data shows males have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History (Arrests/Convictions)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support and supervision, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases financial instability, raising the likelihood of illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance use is linked to impaired judgment and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health State\", \"low\", \"Recent mental health status does not indicate a current problem impacting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background/Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime rates and fewer resources, influencing behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce support networks that could aid rehabilitation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
