    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old Black female with no prior convictions despite one arrest. Her age is young, but being female might lower recidivism risk compared to males. I'll rate Age and Gender as low.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, which suggests stability and support. Stable family ties can reduce criminal behavior, so Family Situation is low.\n\nHer education level is a GED, which is better than dropping out but not as good as higher education. Limited Education could be a moderate risk factor because higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. I'll mark this medium.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year, indicating unemployment. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and criminal activity. So, Employment Status is high.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive; substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism. Thus, Substance Abuse is low.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, so Mental Health is not an immediate concern. That's another low factor.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban area as a child could expose her to higher crime environments, but urban upbringing alone isn't a direct indicator. I'll consider this medium risk.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has a support system or positive outlook, which can reduce recidivism. Spirituality is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: several low factors (age, gender, family, substance abuse, mental health, spirituality) and one medium (limited education and upbringing). The high factor is unemployment. However, her stable personal life and lack of substance issues might outweigh the employment risk. So, I predict she won't be rearrested with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is considered young but not particularly high risk for recidivism compared to younger offenders.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Family Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse indicates stability and support, which are protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive but not as protective as higher education levels, which are associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests low risk related to substance abuse, which is a major predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently reduces the risk of mental health issues contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area at a young age could expose her to higher crime environments, but this is not as significant as other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
