    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: she's 22. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So that's probably a medium risk.\n\nNext, gender: female. From what I know, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females, so being female might be a lower risk factor. But I'm not entirely sure how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Four arrests suggest a pattern of behavior, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending. That seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'5\" and 221 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant physical characteristics are to recidivism unless it's related to health issues that might influence behavior. Maybe low risk here since there's no clear connection provided.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single might mean less social support, which could increase the risk of reoffending. I think that's a medium factor.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. That seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and criminal behavior as a means of survival. Definitely a high-risk factor here.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not current, can be linked to recidivism, though maybe not as strongly as harder drugs. I'd say medium risk.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed recently. No indication of current mental health issues that might increase recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nLiving situation as a child: lived with biological mother in an urban area with six people. Growing up in crowded, urban environments can be associated with higher crime exposure and social disorganization, which might influence behavior. That could be medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God influences her life. Sometimes religion provides a support system that can reduce recidivism. So maybe low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are number of arrests/convictions, lack of education, and unemployment. Medium factors include age, living situation as a child, drug use, and marital status. Lower risks are gender, physical traits, mental health, and religion.\n\nConsidering the balance, especially the presence of multiple high-risk factors like criminal history and unemployment, I think she's at higher risk for rearrest. So my prediction is YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk due to ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single individuals may have less social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment often leads to financial instability, raising recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing in crowded settings may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide stabilizing support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
