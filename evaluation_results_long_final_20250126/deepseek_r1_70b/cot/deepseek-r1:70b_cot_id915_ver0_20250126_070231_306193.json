    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. I know that younger people are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have as much life stability yet. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe's female and Black. Research shows that being a minority can sometimes lead to higher surveillance or policing, but I'm not sure if gender affects it much. Maybe low risk on this one.\n\nNo prior convictions despite an arrest. That's a good sign because it means she hasn't been officially found guilty before. So low risk for prior record.\n\nHer height and weight probably don't relate directly to recidivism, so that's a non-factor\u2014low risk.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support system, which might increase the chance of reoffending. Medium risk here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a big risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and more opportunities for criminal activity. High risk.\n\nDrug use\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years, which is pretty common. But since it's not specified as heavy or current, maybe medium risk.\n\nShe felt down recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if untreated. Medium risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a large household in a rural area when young might mean less supervision or more stressors, so medium risk.\n\nNot religious\u2014some studies suggest that religious affiliation can be protective against recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting this all together: high factors are unemployment and drug use; mediums include age, living situation, mental health, family background; lows elsewhere. Overall, the high factors might tip the prediction towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher risk due to potential immaturity and lack of stable life structures.\"),\n    (\"gender and race\", \"low\", \"Being female and Black may have societal impacts, but these are not direct indicators of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior record\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no convictions suggests lower risk compared to those with multiple or serious prior offenses.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but no current employment or enrollment in college increases idleness, raising recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is common, but without evidence of heavy use or current addiction, the risk is moderate.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down recently could indicate underlying issues that may increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household as a child might have led to less individual attention or stability, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious affiliation doesn't strongly correlate with higher recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 230 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
