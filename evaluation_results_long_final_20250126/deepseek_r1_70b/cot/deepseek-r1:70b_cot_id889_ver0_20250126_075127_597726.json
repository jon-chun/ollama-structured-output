    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's recidivism. Let me start by listing each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger offenders are more likely to reoffend because they might not have stability yet. So that's high risk.\n\nNext, number of arrests: 19 times is a lot, even with some convictions. High frequency suggests a pattern, so high here too.\n\nWeight isn't directly relevant; maybe health issues but not a crime factor, so low.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone could mean less social support, which increases risk. Medium.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not in college indicates limited opportunities, higher recidivism chance. High.\n\nEmployment: No jobs in the past year means instability and possibly turning to crime for income. High.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana is less severe than other drugs, but recent use could affect behavior. Medium.\n\nMental state: Feeling down might indicate depression, which can lead to reoffending if untreated. Medium.\n\nLiving situation as a child: Big household in urban area might mean instability or exposure to crime. Medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: Could be protective if he's active, but alone it doesn't offset other factors. Low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium or high, so prediction is YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n**Risk Assessment for Recidivism**\n\n1. **Age (21 years old): High Risk**\n   - Young adults may lack stability and face higher impulsivity, increasing recidivism likelihood.\n\n2. **Number of Arrests (19 times): High Risk**\n   - A high arrest frequency suggests a persistent pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Weight (210 lbs): Low Risk**\n   - Weight alone doesn't correlate with criminal behavior unless linked to health issues affecting stability.\n\n4. **Marital Status (Never married, living alone): Medium Risk**\n   - Lack of marital support may indicate fewer stabilizing influences in life.\n\n5. **Education (No diploma or GED): High Risk**\n   - Limited education reduces employment opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\n\n6. **Employment (No jobs last year): High Risk**\n   - Unemployment is a strong predictor due to financial instability and idleness.\n\n7. **Drug Use (Marijuana in past month): Medium Risk**\n   - While less severe than other drugs, regular use can impair judgment and increase criminal activity risk.\n\n8. **Mental Health (Depressed feelings): Medium Risk**\n   - Untreated mental health issues can lead to recidivism through self-medication or impulsivity.\n\n9. **Childhood Environment (Large urban household): Medium Risk**\n   - Crowded living conditions in urban areas may expose individuals to higher crime environments and instability.\n\n10. **Religious Beliefs: Low Risk**\n    - Religious involvement can provide support, potentially lowering recidivism risk unless other factors dominate.\n\n**Overall Prediction:**  \nBased on the high number of medium and high-risk factors, there's a strong likelihood of recidivism within three years. Confidence in this prediction is 85%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential lack of life stability and higher impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"19 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, suggesting a high likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not directly correlated with criminal behavior unless it indicates health issues that could influence stability.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried and living alone may reduce social support networks that can mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits employment opportunities, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structured activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior, though less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depressive feelings may indicate untreated mental health issues that could increase recidivism risk if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large urban household at a young age may expose individuals to higher crime environments and instability.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide protective support, potentially reducing recidivism likelihood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
