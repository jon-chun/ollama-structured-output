    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the task is to predict whether a 22-year-old Black female with certain risk factors will be rearrested within three years based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out her specific risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 years old\n2. Gender: Female\n3. Race: Black\n4. Arrests: 4 times, convicted\n5. Height and Weight: 5'5\", 221 lbs\n6. Marital Status: Never married\n7. Living Situation: Living alone\n8. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n9. Employment: Held no jobs during the year\n10. Drug Use: Used marijuana in past four years\n11. Mental Health: Not felt depressed recently\n12. Upbringing: Lived with biological mother in a household of 6 in an urban area\n13. Spirituality: Believes God has a role in her life\n\nNow, I need to compare these factors against the examples given (examples 1-30) and assign weights [low, medium, high] based on how much each factor contributes to recidivism risk.\n\nStarting with age: At 22, she's young. Younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because of less life stability. In the examples, younger people sometimes had higher risks, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nGender: Being female might be a lower risk. From the examples, females seemed to have lower recidivism, so low.\n\nRace: The examples don't show a clear pattern based on race, so probably not a significant factor here. Low.\n\nNumber of arrests and convictions: She has 4 arrests and been convicted. More arrests are a strong indicator of higher risk. High.\n\nHeight/weight: Her weight is quite high (221 lbs at 5'5\"). Obesity can lead to health issues but isn't directly linked to recidivism, so low unless it affects employment or mobility, which she's not working anyway.\n\nMarital status: Never married could indicate less social support, medium.\n\nLiving alone might mean less supervision or support. Medium.\n\nEducation: No diploma and not in college is a big risk factor. Lack of education limits job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. High.\n\nEmployment: Held no jobs, which means no stable income. Unemployment is a strong predictor for recidivism. High.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana isn't as severe as other drugs but still indicates substance issues. Medium.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe low risk there.\n\nUpbringing in an urban area with 6 people could mean higher stress or less attention, medium.\n\nBelieving in God might provide some support, which is protective, so low risk.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nHigh-risk factors are number of arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment. Medium: age, living alone, marital status, upbringing. Low: others.\n\nLooking at the examples, cases with multiple high-risk factors often led to YES predictions. Since she has several high and medium factors, I think the prediction is YES. Confidence-wise, considering the number of high factors, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to less life stability and maturity.\"),\n    (\"Gender (female)\", \"low\", \"Females historically show lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Race (Black)\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation in examples; race itself isn't a direct risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions (4 arrests, convicted)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight (5'5\\\", 221 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Not directly linked to recidivism unless impacting health or mobility.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (never married)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital support might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could reduce supervision and support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Education (no diploma/GED, not enrolled)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment (none)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant predictor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use can increase recidivism risk but less so than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (not depressed recently)\", \"low\", \"Recent mental health stability reduces immediate risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing (urban, household of 6)\", \"medium\", \"Large household in urban area may indicate higher stress or less individual attention.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality (believes in God)\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"85%\"\n}\n```",
