    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, seem to have a higher likelihood of recidivism because they might still be in a phase where they're more impulsive or influenced by peers.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. The examples showed that even one conviction can increase the risk because it indicates he's already involved with the justice system, which might suggest ongoing issues.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't seem to correlate much with recidivism in the given cases.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could be a risk. In the examples, living alone sometimes was associated with higher risk, possibly due to lack of supervision or support structures.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a big one. The examples often showed that lacking education is a strong predictor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to criminal activity as an alternative.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be protective, but frequent job changes might indicate instability, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is present. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can increase recidivism risk by impairing judgment and leading to further legal issues.\n\nFeeling down sometimes in the past month suggests some mental health issues, which can contribute to recidivism if not addressed properly. It indicates he might be struggling emotionally, increasing the likelihood of poor decision-making.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in an urban area of size four. Living in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates and influences that could lead to reoffending. However, having a stable family structure with his mother is a positive factor, which might reduce risk compared to those without such support.\n\nBelieving that God has a role in his life can be protective. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism as they provide a support system and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his young age, conviction, lack of education, and drug use. The medium risks include living alone and unstable employment. Protective factors are his belief in God and family support. On balance, I think the risk is medium, but considering the combination of several high-risk factors, the prediction leans towards a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age (18) increases impulsivity and exposure to risky environments.\"),\n    (\"arrest_and_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One conviction indicates justice system involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support structures, increasing vulnerability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Two jobs suggest some stability, though frequent changes could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment but is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Occasional depression may contribute to poor decision-making if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother provides some stability and support.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer a protective framework against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
