    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me start by carefully analyzing each risk factor based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old White male. Age is a known factor; younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk?\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant indicator of potential recidivism, so that's probably high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 240 lbs. I'm not sure how much body size relates to rearrest. It might be less relevant unless it indicates something else, like health issues or aggression. Maybe low risk here since there's no clear link in the examples.\n\nHe's never married, which could mean less stability or social support. Unmarried individuals might have higher recidivism rates because of fewer ties to the community. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNot living alone suggests he has others around him, maybe family or roommates. That could provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. College enrollment shows he's actively engaged in positive activities, so this should be a low risk.\n\nHolding three jobs in a year indicates instability or perhaps an inability to hold down a job long-term. Job instability can lead to stress and financial issues, increasing recidivism risk. I'll rate this medium.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) is present but not heavy. In the examples, occasional drug use didn't always lead to high risk unless combined with other factors. So maybe medium here.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated, so this being absent lowers the risk. Low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents as a child suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism. Low risk.\n\nNot believing in God or religion might mean less access to some community support networks that religion provides, but it's not a direct indicator. Maybe low risk here since the examples didn't emphasize this much.\n\nPutting it all together: High risk factors are prior conviction and job instability. Medium risks include age, marital status, and drug use. Low risks cover living situation, education, mental health, upbringing, and belief in God. \n\nThe high factor of a prior conviction is strong, but the presence of several protective factors like education and stable upbringing might mitigate that risk. However, job instability could counteract some of those protections.\n\nSo I think the prediction leans towards NO because the protective factors are significant, but my confidence isn't extremely high since there's still some medium and high risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Being young can increase recidivism risk due to impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of conviction is a strong indicator for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height/weight (6'0\\\", 240 lbs)\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism in provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Less social stability might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide support and reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"3 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate higher stress or issues.\"),\n    (\"Marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can contribute to recidivism risk, though not as high as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Doesn't believe in God\", \"low\", \"Less access to religious support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
