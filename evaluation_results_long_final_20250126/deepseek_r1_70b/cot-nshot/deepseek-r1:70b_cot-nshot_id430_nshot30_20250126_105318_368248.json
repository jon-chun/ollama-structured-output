    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this particular case based on the provided risk factors. Let me start by analyzing each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. From the examples, age and gender don't seem to be the most significant factors, but being young might slightly increase the risk since younger individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates. However, it's not a major factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, prior arrests without convictions sometimes led to \"NO\" outcomes because it might indicate less severe charges or first-time offenses. So this could be a low-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight (5'9\", 160 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism, so that's probably a non-factor or very low risk.\n\nShe is divorced, which introduces some instability in her personal life. Divorce can indicate stress or financial issues, but without more context, it's hard to weigh this heavily. Maybe medium risk because personal stability can affect behavior.\n\nNot living alone might mean she has a support system, like family or roommates, which could be a protective factor against recidivism. So that's probably low risk.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a known factor; lower education can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism because it might limit job opportunities. However, having a GED is better than nothing. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHeld one job in the past year suggests some employment stability, which is positive. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this would be low risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor. Substance abuse is often linked to higher recidivism, but she's clean for four years, so that should be low risk.\n\nShe's felt down most of the time recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if not addressed properly. This could be a high-risk factor because untreated mental health problems might lead to poor decision-making or relapse into criminal behavior.\n\nLiving in a household of size 3 as a child doesn't provide much information on its own. Household size isn't a strong indicator unless it's very large or small, but here it seems average, so maybe low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. In some studies, religious affiliation can be a protective factor against recidivism as it provides support and moral framework. So lacking that might slightly increase risk, but not significantly\u2014maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together: The high-risk factors are her recent depression. Medium risks include being divorced and lack of religion. Low risks include young age, arrest without conviction, living situation, job stability, no drug use, household size as a child.\n\nSince she's mentally struggling, that's a significant concern. However, she has stable employment and hasn't used drugs, which are positive signs. The absence of prior convictions also helps. I think the mental health issue might be the main driver here, but her support system (not living alone) and job could mitigate some risks.\n\nLooking at examples where depression was present, sometimes they led to \"YES\" if other factors were negative. But in this case, she has more positives like job stability and no drug use. So I'm leaning towards a lower risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22 years old)\", \"low\", \"Younger age might slightly increase risk but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"First-time offense suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Divorced status\", \"medium\", \"Potential personal instability but impact is moderate.\"),\n    (\"Not living alone\", \"low\", \"Support system may reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"GED and no college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Lower education could limit job opportunities but GED is positive.\"),\n    (\"Employed in the past year\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No drug use\", \"low\", \"Lack of substance abuse is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Recent depression\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Household size as a child\", \"low\", \"Average household size doesn't indicate significant risk.\"),\n    (\"Atheistic beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious support might slightly increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
