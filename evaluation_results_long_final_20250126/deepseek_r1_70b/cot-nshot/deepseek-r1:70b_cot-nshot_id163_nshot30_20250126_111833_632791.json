    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals seem to have a higher risk because they might not have stable life structures yet. So I'd rate age as medium risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A conviction often indicates a more serious offense or at least a case that went through the system, so this could be a high-risk factor since it shows she's already in the system and maybe hasn't been deterred.\n\nHer height and weight are average for her age, so I don't think that plays a significant role here. Low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support network, she might be more likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can sometimes provide stability or alternatives, so not being in college might be a low risk since having a diploma is still positive, but not continuing education could be a missed opportunity for growth.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. That's a lot of job changes, which could indicate instability or issues with employment, which is a high-risk factor because unstable employment can lead to financial stress and possibly illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine. Both are illegal substances, and using harder drugs like cocaine increases the risk significantly. This is definitely a high-risk factor as substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\nShe's felt down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk because it's occasional but still concerning.\n\nLiving in a household size of four when young doesn't seem too risky; maybe low since it's an average family size and not indicative of neglect or overcrowding.\n\nBelieving that God has influence might provide some support or positive outlook. In the examples, sometimes religious beliefs were seen as protective factors, so I'd rate this as low risk because it could help her stay on a positive path.\n\nPutting all these together: High risks are conviction, job instability, and drug use. Medium risks include age and mental health issues. Lower risks include living alone, education status, religious beliefs, and family background. The high-risk factors might outweigh the lower ones, leading to a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to less life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrested and convicted\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates serious legal involvement, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a diploma is positive; not continuing education is a minor concern.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, raising recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of illegal drugs like cocaine is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Occasional feelings of depression could indicate unmet needs.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Average household size doesn't indicate neglect or overcrowding.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
