    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old White male. Age can be a significant factor because younger individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, I'm not sure how much weight to give race here; maybe it's less relevant compared to other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction could indicate a higher risk of recidivism, so that seems like a medium factor because it's a significant point but not the most severe.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant unless they relate to violent behavior, which isn't indicated here. So I'll consider that low.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor, so medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education can be a protective factor as it indicates engagement and potential for rehabilitation. That would be a low risk.\n\nHeld one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing stability, but only having one job might not be as strong as multiple jobs. So maybe medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a big risk factor for recidivism, so this being absent lowers the risk. That's low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism. However, without knowing his mental health history, it's hard to say, but current stability is positive. So that's medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a rural area suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective. Rural areas might have less access to certain services but also less exposure to urban crime. That seems low risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God controls his actions, which could mean he takes personal responsibility, or it might indicate a lack of support from religious communities. This is tricky; maybe medium because it's not clear how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: the prior conviction and living alone are the main concerns, but being in school, stable home background, no drug use, and current mental health are positives. So I think the recidivism risk might be lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Being 18 could indicate impulsivity, but not a strong indicator alone.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Not a significant factor compared to others.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A prior conviction increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"No clear relevance to recidivism here.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment suggests positive engagement and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a job can stabilize behavior but only one job.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Current stability is positive, but history unclear.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable home environment reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Beliefs might affect personal responsibility or support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
