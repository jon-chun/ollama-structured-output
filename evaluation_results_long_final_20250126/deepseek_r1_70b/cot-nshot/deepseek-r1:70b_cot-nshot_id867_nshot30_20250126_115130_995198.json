    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals seem more prone to recidivism because they might not have as much life stability yet. So I'd rate this as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Multiple arrests without convictions could mean he's either not being caught in serious offenses or maybe getting off on technicalities. However, the frequency suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's another high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to be a significant factor here. I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone at 19 might indicate some instability or lack of support system, which could contribute to higher recidivism. That feels like a medium risk factor because it's not the most direct indicator but still relevant.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can sometimes reduce recidivism by providing better opportunities, so not being in college might be a low to medium risk. I'm leaning towards low since he does have a diploma.\n\nHolding two jobs in a year shows some stability and responsibility, which is actually a protective factor. So this would be a low-risk factor because it suggests he's employed and has income, reducing the need for criminal activity.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over four years, is a concern but not as severe as harder drugs. It's a medium risk since substance abuse can increase recidivism but isn't the highest indicator here.\n\nFeeling down sometimes in the past month could indicate mental health issues, which might increase recidivism if untreated. This is probably a low to medium risk factor because it's occasional and not constant.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area during youth might have some environmental influences, but urban areas alone don't dictate outcomes. I'd rate this as low since family support is present.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. In the examples, religious beliefs sometimes correlated with lower recidivism. So not having that belief could be a medium risk factor because it might mean less access to certain support networks.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are age and multiple arrests. Medium include living alone, drug use, and lack of religion. The rest are low. The higher number of high-risk factors makes me lean towards predicting \"YES\" for recidivism, but with moderate confidence because some protective factors like employment might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19)\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (3)\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests without conviction may indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to future legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with isolation or instability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism, though marijuana use is generally considered lower risk than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"Feelings of depression\", \"low\", \"While mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, the description here is not severe enough to be a high-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Lack of higher education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma reduces this risk compared to those without one, though not being enrolled in college could be a minor concern.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
