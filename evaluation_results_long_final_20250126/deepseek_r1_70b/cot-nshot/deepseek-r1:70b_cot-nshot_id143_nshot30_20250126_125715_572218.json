    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided examples. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 22, which is relatively young. From the examples, younger individuals seem to have a higher likelihood of recidivism because they might not have as much life stability yet. So I'll consider her age as a medium risk factor since it's not extremely high but still notable.\n\nNext, being female. In many studies, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females. The examples also show more males with 'YES' outcomes. So her gender might be a low risk factor for rearrest.\n\nShe has one prior arrest without conviction. Some examples with one arrest and no conviction resulted in 'NO', but others had different outcomes based on other factors. This seems like a medium risk because while an arrest is a concern, the lack of conviction might lower it.\n\nHer height and weight (5'7\", 155 lbs) don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but being unmarried isn't necessarily a strong indicator. This feels like a medium risk because the lack of immediate family support could be a factor.\n\nHaving a Bachelor's degree is a positive indicator. Education often correlates with lower recidivism as it can provide better job opportunities and stability. So this should be a low risk factor.\n\nShe held 4 jobs in the past year, which indicates instability. Job instability can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to financial stress or other related issues. I'll mark this as high risk because frequent job changes are a red flag.\n\nDrug use with both marijuana and cocaine is significant. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to further legal issues. Since she used more than one substance, this should be a high-risk factor.\n\nFeeling down sometimes in the past month could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, might increase recidivism risk. However, since it's only some of the time and not constant, I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area during youth suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism. So this is a low-risk factor.\n\nBelieving God has nothing to do with her life might reduce the protective effect religion can have on behavior. Some studies suggest religious involvement can lower recidivism. So I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high job instability and drug use are major concerns, while age, mental health, and beliefs add to the risk. Protective factors like education and stable upbringing help, but the negatives might outweigh them. Looking at examples, cases with multiple high-risk factors often result in 'YES'. However, her education is a strong positive factor which might mitigate some risks.\n\nI think the prediction should be 'YES' because job instability and drug use are significant, even though she has a degree. My confidence isn't too high because there's a balance between risk and protective factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young and may indicate less life stability, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests some risk but is not as significant as multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical stature and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having completed a Bachelor's degree is a protective factor against recidivism as it suggests stability and better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding four jobs in one year indicates instability, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism due to potential financial or personal issues.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor as substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues, which if unaddressed, might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household during youth is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"A lack of religious belief may reduce a potential protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
