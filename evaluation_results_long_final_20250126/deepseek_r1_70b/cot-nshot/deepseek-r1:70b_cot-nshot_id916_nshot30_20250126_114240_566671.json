    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person will be rearrested within three years. Let me start by looking at each of the risk factors provided in the case and see how they compare to the examples given.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old White male. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a major factor on its own unless it's extremely young or old, but being 21 might still be considered somewhat young, which could relate to higher impulsivity. However, since many of the examples include similar ages, I don't think this alone is a high risk.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, arrest without conviction sometimes leads to a \"NO\" prediction, maybe because it suggests less severe charges or first-time offense. But in some cases with other risk factors, even without conviction, there's a higher chance. I need to weigh this as medium.\n\nHe is 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs., which is average build. Physical characteristics don't seem to play a role in the examples provided, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nNot living alone might mean he has family support or someone to monitor his behavior, which could be a protective factor against recidivism. In the examples, living situation sometimes plays a role, but it's not a major one here. So maybe medium.\n\nHe completed an associate/junior college and isn't enrolled now. Higher education usually is a positive factor reducing recidivism. However, in some examples, even with education, other factors like drug use can influence the outcome. I think this should be low risk because having an education generally helps.\n\nHolding two jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility, which are good signs. Employment is often a protective factor against reoffending, so I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. In many examples, substance abuse correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to impulsive behavior or relate to underlying issues that contribute to criminal activity. This should be high risk.\n\nNo feelings of depression recently could mean he's mentally stable, which is positive. Mental health issues, especially depression, can sometimes increase recidivism if not addressed, but since he hasn't felt depressed lately, this might lower the risk. So I'll consider this low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child indicates a supportive environment. This is a protective factor and should be low risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has an influence on his life. In some examples, religious beliefs can provide a support system or moral framework that reduces recidivism. However, the absence of it might not necessarily increase risk unless other factors are present. I'll rate this as medium because it's less about the belief itself and more about what support systems he has.\n\nPutting all these together: The high risk from drug use is concerning, but factors like stable employment, education, family support, and no recent mental health issues might mitigate that. However, substance abuse is a strong predictor, so I'm leaning towards a higher chance of rearrest.\n\nBut looking at the examples, when drug use was present without other strong protective factors, it often led to \"YES\". Here, he has some protective factors but also a history of using harder drugs like cocaine. So maybe medium confidence that he'll recidivate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"low\", \"Young adults may have higher impulsivity but not significantly high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"Arrested once, not convicted\", \"medium\", \"Suggests possible first-time offense or less severe charges, but could indicate potential for reoffending without conviction.\"),\n    (\"Average build\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not contribute to recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Not living alone\", \"medium\", \"May indicate family support, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Completed associate/junior college\", \"low\", \"Higher education typically reduces recidivism risk by providing stability and skills.\"),\n    (\"Held two jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a protective factor against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to its association with impulsive behavior and underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Mental stability reduces the likelihood of recidivism related to emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Stable household in youth\", \"low\", \"Supportive upbringing can reduce recidivism risk by providing a stable environment.\"),\n    (\"Doesn't believe God influences life\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may remove a potential protective factor, though not directly indicative of higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
