    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old White male. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a huge factor unless someone is very young or older. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, were often high-risk factors because it shows a pattern of behavior. So that would probably be high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average\u20145'11\" and 150-174 lbs. That doesn't seem to correlate with recidivism in the examples, so I'll mark that low.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. In some cases, living alone might mean less stability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium risk here because family support can play a role, but without more info, it's not too high.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a big factor; lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. So that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held four jobs in a year. Job instability could mean he has trouble keeping employment, which might lead to illegal activities out of necessity. That sounds like medium risk because it shows instability but not necessarily a lack of employment entirely.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk here\u2014definitely low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling down now, that's a good sign\u2014low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Stable family environment might reduce risk, so maybe medium because it's better than foster care or instability, but urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates. Not too sure, but I'll go with low since living with a parent is generally positive.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. In the examples, religion sometimes was seen as a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So that's probably a low risk because it might provide support or moral guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are multiple arrests/convictions and lack of education. Medium factors are living alone and job instability. The rest are low. Since the high-risk factors are significant but there are some positives like no drug use and religious belief, I think the overall prediction is NO with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age of 21 is not particularly indicative of higher recidivism risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate social isolation or instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests lower socio-economic status and fewer opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held four jobs in one year could indicate instability, but it also shows some level of employability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a stable household during childhood is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
