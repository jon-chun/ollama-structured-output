    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. From the examples, being young didn't always lead to a YES, but it might be a low or medium factor since youth can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, often led to a YES prediction. This seems like a high-risk factor because prior offenses are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; I'll skip that unless it's about physicality, but no info links that to rearrest.\n\nLiving alone was sometimes a factor in the examples, maybe indicating less support, so I'd rate that medium risk.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is good, but not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities. Education can be protective, so this could be low or medium. Since he has a diploma, it's better than not having one, so maybe low risk.\n\nHolding two jobs during the year suggests some stability, which is positive. Employment is usually a protective factor against recidivism, so I'd rate that as low risk.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over four years, is present but not as severe as other drugs. It's a moderate factor. Some examples with drug use did lead to YES, especially if combined with other issues.\n\nFeeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues, which might increase recidivism risk if untreated. I'd consider this medium risk because it can affect behavior and decision-making.\n\nLiving in a household of size seven as a child might mean less individual attention or resources, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe low or medium risk.\n\nBelieving that God has influence could be a protective factor, providing emotional support. So I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nNow, considering all factors: multiple arrests and convictions are high-risk. Medium risks include living alone, mental health issues, and household size. Low risks are age, education, employment, drug use (marijuana), and religious beliefs. The combination leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest because the high factor of prior offenses is significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"low\", \"Young age can be associated with impulsivity but isn't a strong sole indicator.\"),\n    (\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a high likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might suggest limited social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Having a diploma is protective; not being in college is a minor risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe but still a risk factor when combined with others.\"),\n    (\"Mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of depression could increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Household size (7)\", \"low\", \"Large household might indicate instability, but impact is unclear without context.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
