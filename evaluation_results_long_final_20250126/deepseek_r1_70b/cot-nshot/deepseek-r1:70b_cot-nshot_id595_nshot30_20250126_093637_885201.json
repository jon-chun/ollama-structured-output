    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this particular case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age might not be a huge factor here since he's still relatively young but not a juvenile anymore. Ethnicity doesn't directly indicate a risk, so maybe that's low.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and was convicted. That seems significant because prior convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'd rate this as high.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll consider those low factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but it's not a direct correlation. Maybe medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a concern because education often helps in getting jobs and reducing recidivism. This is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective against recidivism, so this might lower his risk. I'll mark that as low.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over four years, is a known risk factor for recidivism. So that's high.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression could mean he's mentally stable now, which is positive. But if he had some issues before, it's unclear. Maybe medium, but in this case, since there are no current symptoms, maybe low.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four might not be directly risky unless there were other negative factors. So I'll rate that as low.\n\nBelieving that God has influence could provide some support or structure, which is positive. So that's probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the high factors are prior convictions and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and lack of education. The rest are low. It seems like the higher risks might tip the prediction towards YES, but I'm not 100% sure because some factors are mitigating.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"Age is not a significant risk factor for recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"Male\", \"medium\", \"Being male can be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to female.\"),\n    (\"Hispanic ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not indicate a specific risk level.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 2 times and convicted\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height (5'11\\\") and weight (210 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not directly relate to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Never married and living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can hinder employment opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs in the past year\", \"low\", \"Employment generally reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Absence of current mental health issues may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban household of 4\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment and living conditions do not indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
