    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let's start by analyzing each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Her age could be a risk factor because younger individuals might have higher rates of recidivism due to impulsive behavior or less life stability. However, being female might lower this risk since some studies suggest lower recidivism rates for women compared to men.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate a lower risk since it's her first offense and she hasn't been found guilty yet. But the absence of a conviction could also mean the case is ongoing or other factors, so I'm not sure how much weight this carries.\n\nHer height and weight (5'7\", 146 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism, so that's probably a low factor.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism as having a strong support system can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So this might be a medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal behavior as an alternative. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nShe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism since it leads to financial instability and increases the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities. So this is also a high-risk factor.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is strongly linked with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit or impair judgment. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nMost of the time during the past month, she's felt down, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, as they might lead to self-medication with drugs or other negative behaviors. So this is a medium to high risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 8 in an urban area when young. Growing up in a large household might indicate instability or overcrowding, which can be a stressor. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and less access to resources, so that's another medium-risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life, which could provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk by offering a sense of purpose or community. So this might be a protective factor, lowering the risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: high risks from lack of education, unemployment, drug use; medium risks from living situation, mental health, and being young; and some lower risks like first arrest without conviction and her gender. The presence of mental health issues and substance abuse are particularly concerning as they often go hand-in-hand with higher recidivism.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, cases with multiple high-risk factors (like drug use, unemployment, lack of education) often result in a YES prediction. Especially when combined with mental health struggles, which can exacerbate other risk factors. Even though some factors like gender and belief might lower the risk, the cumulative effect of several high-risk factors likely leads to a higher probability of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity or lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"Gender (female)\", \"low\", \"Lower recidivism rates are often observed among females compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"First-time offense with no conviction suggests lower risk, though it's not conclusive.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Limited job opportunities can lead to criminal behavior as an alternative.\"),\n    (\"Unemployed\", \"high\", \"Financial instability increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly linked with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Depression or mental health struggles can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Large household in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Potential instability or exposure to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"May provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
