    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the age is 21. From the examples, younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, might have a higher tendency towards impulsive behavior which could increase recidivism risk. But being 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nNext, he's male. In many studies, males do have a higher recidivism rate compared to females, so that's probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has two arrests but no convictions. Two arrests show some pattern of behavior, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending. However, not being convicted might mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty, so maybe medium risk here because it's not as severe as a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are average, 5'11\" and 182 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor in recidivism unless related to specific crimes, which isn't indicated here. So that would be low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can sometimes lead to higher recidivism if someone feels isolated. However, being single itself isn't a strong indicator, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low to medium risk.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides stability. Only having one job might indicate some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, so that's probably medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the last four years is a positive sign. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk here, making this a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated, but since he's not experiencing depression now, it's a lower risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents as a child in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so that's low risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without specific neighborhood issues mentioned, the stable upbringing likely outweighs that.\n\nBelieves God has influence. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. So this is probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: High-risk factors are being male. Medium risks include age, number of arrests, living alone, job stability, and education level. Low risks cover the rest. The presence of some medium and one high-risk factor makes me lean towards a higher chance, but not certain. Maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young but not extremely high risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate some pattern of behavior, though no convictions\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year could indicate instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the last four years reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers this risk factor\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
