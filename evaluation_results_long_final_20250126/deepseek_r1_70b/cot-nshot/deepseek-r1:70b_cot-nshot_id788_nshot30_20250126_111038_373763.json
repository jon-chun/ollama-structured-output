    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old White male with two arrests and one conviction. That already seems significant because multiple arrests can indicate a pattern of behavior. In the examples provided, people with prior convictions often had higher risks, so I'd consider this a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, he's 5'11\" and 160 lbs. I don't see how height or weight would directly influence rearrest unless it's related to physical crimes, but that doesn't seem relevant here. So maybe low risk on this factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk because without a strong support system, individuals might engage in risky behaviors more easily.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can sometimes correlate with stability; not having higher education might limit job opportunities, which is a medium risk factor as it could lead to unemployment or financial instability that might drive criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a medium risk because unstable work history can contribute to recidivism if someone can't find steady income.\n\nDrug use is another big one\u2014he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for recidivism since it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe sometimes feels down, which might indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism if not properly addressed, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in a household of four might not be as risky as coming from a broken home or foster care, but family environment can still play a role. However, without more info on the family dynamics, I'd consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nBelieving that God has influence over his life could have both positive and negative effects. Spirituality can sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism, so maybe a low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are prior conviction and drug use; mediums include living alone, education level, job instability, mental health; lows are physical stats, family background, spirituality. The combination leans towards higher risk, especially with the multiple arrests and substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (21)\", \"low\", \"Young adults may have higher impulsivity but age alone isn't a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"gender (male)\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity generally has minimal direct impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests (2 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior and potential challenges with adherence to the law\"),\n    (\"convictions (1)\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction suggests legal system involvement and potential higher risk\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not strongly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital status (never married)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital ties can indicate less social support, a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social supervision and support\"),\n    (\"education level (high school diploma)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment status (2 jobs in past year)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate challenges with maintaining steady employment, which can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism as it impairs judgment and increases illegal activity likelihood\"),\n    (\"mental health indicators (some depression)\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can elevate recidivism risk if untreated or poorly managed\"),\n    (\"family background (biological mother, household size 4)\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents in a stable household generally reduces risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"religiosity (believes God influences life)\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective against recidivism by providing moral framework and support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
