    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White female based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, prior conviction is a strong indicator, often leading to higher recidivism. So that's a high-risk factor.\n\nHer age is 19, which is young. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might not yet have stable life structures. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor for recidivism. However, it's not as significant on its own, so maybe low to medium. Let me go with medium here.\n\nHolding three jobs in a year might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can be stressful and increase the chance of reoffending. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Substance abuse is a big predictor, so not using drugs lowers her risk here\u2014low.\n\nShe's felt down some of the time recently, indicating possible mental health issues. Poor mental health can increase recidivism if untreated. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with only her biological mother in a small household might mean less supervision or support, contributing to higher risk. I'll consider this medium.\n\nNot believing in God might reduce social connections through religious communities, which can be protective. So, maybe a low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: several medium risks and one high. The conviction is a strong indicator. However, the absence of drug use and some factors being lower might balance it out. Looking at examples, cases with similar profiles sometimes result in \"NO\" if they have mitigating factors like stable employment or no substance abuse. But here, job instability and mental health issues are concerns.\n\nI think I'll lean towards a prediction of \"YES\" because the prior conviction is significant, but my confidence isn't extremely high due to some positive factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (19 years)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism as they may lack stability and life experience.\"),\n    (\"gender (female)\", \"low\", \"Gender alone is not a strong predictor, but females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity is not a significant predictor in this context.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time and convicted\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates past involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight (5'8\\\" and 120 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status (never married)\", \"low\", \"Marital status alone is a weak predictor, but being unmarried can sometimes indicate less stability.\"),\n    (\"living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and increase isolation, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)\", \"medium\", \"Lower educational attainment can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment (3 jobs in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability or frequent job changes may indicate higher stress or instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use (no drug use in the past 4 years)\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent drug use reduces this specific risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health (some depression)\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not properly addressed with treatment or support.\"),\n    (\"family background (lived with biological mother in a household of size 2)\", \"low\", \"Family background is not strongly indicative unless there are specific negative factors, which are not detailed here.\"),\n    (\"religiosity (doesn't believe in God)\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support from faith-based communities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
