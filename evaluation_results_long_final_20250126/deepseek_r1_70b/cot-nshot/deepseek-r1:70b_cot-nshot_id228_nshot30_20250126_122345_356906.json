    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times already and has a conviction. That seems like a significant red flag because multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. So I'd rate that as high risk.\n\nNext, his age is 18. Younger individuals might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives, which can lead to recidivism. I'm thinking medium risk here because while it's not the highest, it does contribute.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might push him towards criminal activities. That feels like a medium risk factor as well.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having multiple short-term jobs might indicate instability. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative, so maybe low risk because it shows some effort, but not enough to offset other factors.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase recidivism chances. So that's a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism, so this might lower his risk a bit. I'll consider this a low risk factor because it's a positive sign.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean less support or more freedom to engage in risky behavior, but it's not as significant as other factors. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a small household. Stable family environments can reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor. I'll rate that low risk because it suggests some stability.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with what happens personally could provide a support system or positive influence, potentially lowering the risk of rearrest. So another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are the multiple arrests and conviction; mediums include young age, lack of education, drug use, and living alone. The lowers are employment, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors seem to outweigh the lower ones, so I'm leaning towards a higher confidence in rearrest. But since some factors like current mental state and family support might help, maybe it's not extremely high.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES because multiple high and medium risks are present. Confidence-wise, considering the balance, maybe around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a high likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"young age\", \"medium\", \"At 18, he may still engage in risky behaviors typical of youth.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"No diploma/GED can limit job prospects, increasing criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs shows some stability but also possible instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use might impair judgment and increase recidivism chances.\"),\n    (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to those with mental issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less support, increasing risky behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with his mother indicates a stable home environment.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
