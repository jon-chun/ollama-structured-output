    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old White male. Age is a factor, but at 21, it's not particularly high risk on its own unless combined with other issues.\n\nHe has been arrested once and was convicted. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor because it indicates that he's already been through the justice system, which might suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium or maybe high because it shows some level of criminal behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet tall and over 250 lbs. This could be a physical attribute but doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless linked to aggression, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low risk for this factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone might indicate instability or lack of social support, which can contribute to higher risk. Being unmarried at 21 isn't unusual, so the impact is probably low to medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This is a significant factor because education level correlates with employment opportunities. Lower education often leads to fewer job options, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity as an alternative. I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This could be a medium risk because it's not a strong indicator on its own but combined with other factors like education, it adds up.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior to support addiction or impair judgment. This should be high risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might actually lower the risk slightly. So maybe low risk here.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of four as a young age. Stable family environment could reduce risk factors, so I'd rate this as low risk because it suggests some level of support or stability.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. This might relate to lack of social or religious support networks, which can increase recidivism risk. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nPutting all together: High risks are no diploma and drug use; medium include prior conviction, job instability, and lack of belief in God; lows are age, living situation, family background, and mental health. The combination leans towards higher risk, so prediction is YES with around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (21 years old)\", \"low\", \"Age is a moderate factor but not high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes alone don't indicate higher risk without context.\"),\n    (\"living situation (alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate some instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education level (no diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lower education correlates with fewer opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history (1 job in a year)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability can contribute to higher risk when combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant indicator for potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health status (no depression)\", \"low\", \"No recent mental health issues may lower the risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"family background (stable household)\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment suggests lower risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs (no belief in God)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious support might increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
