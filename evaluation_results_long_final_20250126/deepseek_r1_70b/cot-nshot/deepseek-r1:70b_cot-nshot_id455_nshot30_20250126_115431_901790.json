    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors and the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the case details: a 22-year-old White female with one arrest but no conviction. She's 5'10\", weighs between 150-174 lbs. Never married, not living alone, has a high school diploma and is in a graduate program. She's held three jobs this year, used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently. Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area of six people and believes God influences her life.\n\nI need to break down each risk factor and assign weights based on how much they might influence recidivism.\n\n1. Age: 22 is young. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed decision-making skills yet. So maybe medium or high weight?\n\n2. Gender: Female. Historically, males have higher recidivism rates than females, so being female could be a lower risk factor. Maybe low.\n\n3. Arrests without conviction: She's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate less severe charges or first-time offense. Lower risk, maybe medium because the arrest itself is a factor, but no conviction might mean it's not as serious.\n\n4. Height and weight: Not sure how relevant this is to recidivism. Maybe low or not considered.\n\n5. Marital status: Never married. Some studies suggest that being married can be a stabilizing factor, reducing recidivism. So maybe medium risk here because she isn't married.\n\n6. Living situation: Currently not living alone. That could mean she has support from family or roommates, which is positive. Maybe low risk.\n\n7. Education and employment: She's in a graduate program, which is a high level of education and indicates stability and lower recidivism. Having held three jobs this year might show instability or perhaps just being busy. I'm not sure; maybe it's neutral, but education leans towards lower risk. So maybe medium for the job part because multiple jobs could indicate instability.\n\n8. Drug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to further criminal behavior or relapse. High weight here.\n\n9. Mental health: No depression recently, which is positive. So maybe low risk on this factor.\n\n10. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area with six people. Stable family environment usually reduces recidivism, so low risk.\n\n11. Religious beliefs: Believes God influences her life. Some studies show that religious involvement can reduce recidivism by providing support and moral framework. So maybe low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- High-risk factors: Drug use (high)\n- Medium-risk factors: Age (medium), employment stability (medium), no conviction (maybe medium because the arrest is a factor)\n- Low-risk factors: Gender, living situation, education, family background, religion\n\nIn the examples provided, cases with multiple high or medium risk factors often resulted in 'YES' for recidivism. However, this case has a strong positive factor with graduate education and stable family, which are protective against recidivism.\n\nThe presence of drug use is concerning, but other factors might mitigate that risk. Maybe the overall prediction is 'NO', with moderate confidence because while there's some risk, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"An arrest indicates some risk, though no conviction suggests lower severity.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education (graduate program)\", \"low\", \"Higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment (3 jobs)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might indicate higher risk, though employment itself is positive.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (not alone)\", \"low\", \"Support from others can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family background (stable)\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing reduces recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
