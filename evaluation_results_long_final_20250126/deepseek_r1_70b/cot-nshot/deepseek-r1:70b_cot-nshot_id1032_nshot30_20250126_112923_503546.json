    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates, but she's not extremely young. I might rate this as medium.\n\nShe has been arrested once without a conviction. In the examples, some with arrests but no convictions had lower risks, so maybe low for this factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here, so that's probably a non-factor.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stability in relationships might reduce recidivism, so I could consider this as a protective factor, perhaps low risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests lower socio-economic status, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. This might be medium to high risk.\n\nNot being enrolled in college could mean she's not engaged in education, which might increase risk, but since she's married and living with her spouse, maybe it's medium.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year\u2014unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism. I would rate this as high because lack of employment can lead to criminal activity due to financial stress.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, so that's low risk.\n\nShe has felt down some of the time recently, indicating possible mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase recidivism if not addressed, so medium risk.\n\nLiving in a household size of 4 as a child might indicate stability, but it depends on other factors too. I'm not sure about this one; maybe low or medium. But without more info, perhaps low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God controls her life\u2014this could relate to lack of social support from religious communities, which are sometimes protective. So maybe medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are unemployment and no diploma/GED. Medium includes mental health, age, living situation, religion. Lows include arrest without conviction and household size. The presence of high-risk factors like unemployment might tip the prediction towards YES, but her stable marriage could be a counter. However, since she hasn't worked and lacks education, recidivism is more likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not particularly high risk compared to younger ages.\"),\n    (\"arrested once without conviction\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest lower likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"married and living with spouse\", \"medium\", \"Stable relationship may reduce recidivism risk, but lacks other protective factors.\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"held no jobs during the year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases likelihood of reoffending due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"no drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of substance abuse reduces risk factors.\"),\n    (\"some feelings of depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if untreated.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
