    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 19-year-old Black female will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In some cases, a first-time arrest without conviction didn't always lead to a high rearrest rate, so maybe that's a low risk factor here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant in the examples, so I'll consider that a low risk.\n\nLiving alone could mean she doesn't have strong social support, which might increase recidivism risk. But it's not as clear-cut, so I think medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a big deal because education often provides stability and opportunities. Without it, she might struggle more, leading to higher recidivism chances. That would be a high risk factor.\n\nHolding three jobs in a year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which isn't good for long-term stability. So medium risk here.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is present. In some examples, drug use was linked to higher recidivism, so that's probably a medium risk.\n\nFeeling down often in the past month suggests mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if not addressed. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size five as a child might indicate a less stable or more chaotic environment growing up, which could contribute to higher risks later on. So medium risk here.\n\nBelieving that God has influence might provide some support or coping mechanism, but it's unclear how much it affects recidivism. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: high risk from lack of education, mediums from living alone, job instability, drug use, mental health, and household size. So overall, the factors lean towards higher risk. The examples showed that when there are multiple medium and some high risks, especially around education and mental health, rearrest was more likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19 years)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues or lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"First-time arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may not significantly indicate future criminal behavior compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate limited social support, which might increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and can lead to further criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate struggles with maintaining employment, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Frequent feelings of depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues, if untreated, can contribute to higher recidivism rates by affecting behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5 during youth\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a larger household might indicate environmental stressors that could increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
