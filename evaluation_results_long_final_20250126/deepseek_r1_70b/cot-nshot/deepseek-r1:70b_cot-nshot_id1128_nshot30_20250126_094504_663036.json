    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of reoffending because they might not have stable life structures yet. So I'd rate that as medium.\n\nNext, being male and Black. Males have higher recidivism rates than females, and systemic factors might play a role here. That seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, so that should be high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to me, so I'll mark them as low.\n\nMarital status: never married. Being single might mean less stable social support, which can increase recidivism chances. So medium risk.\n\nLiving alone could indicate a lack of supervision or support, but it's not the strongest factor. Maybe medium.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED and isn't in college. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism, so that's medium.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the past year. Having some employment can be stabilizing, which might lower risk. So low.\n\nDrug use with marijuana is common but not as severe as harder drugs. Still, any drug use can increase recidivism, so medium.\n\nFeeling down sometimes could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated can lead to reoffending. That's medium.\n\nLiving in an urban area might expose him to higher crime environments, so that's medium.\n\nFamily structure: lived with his biological mother in a small household. Single-parent households are associated with higher risks, so high.\n\nBelief in God might provide some support and reduce recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. So low.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential lack of stable life structures.\"),\n    (\"gender and race\", \"high\", \"Being male and Black may be associated with systemic factors that increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being single might indicate less stable social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate a lack of supervision or support.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college may be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to those with higher education.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held multiple jobs suggests some stability and lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, even if only marijuana, can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"mental health indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate untreated mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"neighborhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments are often associated with higher crime rates and fewer resources, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family structure\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a single-parent household is linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"spirituality/religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide some support but isn't a strong protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
