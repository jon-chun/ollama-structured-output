    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided examples and risk factor analysis. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the person's details:\n\n- He is a 21-year-old Black male.\n- He has been arrested twice and convicted once.\n- His height and weight are 6 feet and 207 lbs, which seems average to slightly above but not significantly high.\n- He is married and living with his spouse. This could be a stabilizing factor as having a supportive family might reduce recidivism.\n- He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can sometimes be a protective factor against recidivism, so having at least a diploma is positive.\n- He hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\n- No drug use in the past four years, which is a strong positive indicator since substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n- He hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, but here it seems stable.\n- Lived with both biological parents as a child, indicating a stable upbringing which might lower recidivism chances.\n- Believes that God has influence in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism.\n\nNow, analyzing the examples provided:\n\nFrom Examples 1 to 30, I notice several factors that seem influential:\n\n1. Number of arrests and convictions: More prior arrests, especially with convictions, increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n2. Employment status: Unemployment is a strong risk factor for recidivism.\n3. Drug use: Recent or past drug usage often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n4. Mental health issues: Feelings of depression can increase recidivism if not managed properly.\n5. Living situation and family support: Stable living conditions, like living with a spouse, might reduce recidivism.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Arrests/Convictions: 2 arrests, 1 conviction. This is a medium risk because prior convictions do indicate some likelihood of reoffending but it's not extremely high.\n- Employment: No jobs in the past year \u2013 this is a high risk factor as unemployment can lead to recidivism.\n- Drug Use: None in four years \u2013 low risk.\n- Mental Health: No recent depression \u2013 low risk.\n- Living Situation: Married and living with spouse \u2013 low risk, provides stability.\n- Education: High school diploma \u2013 low risk, better than not having it.\n\nLooking at the examples where unemployment was present (e.g., Example 30), even without drug use or mental health issues, rearrest was predicted as NO. But in some cases with unemployment and other factors like depression, the prediction was YES (Example 27). \n\nIn this case, the strong protective factors are marriage, stable upbringing, no drug use, and no depression. The main risk is unemployment. However, considering the examples, even with unemployment, if other factors are positive, the rearrest might be less likely.\n\nSo, weighing these:\n\n- Arrests: Medium\n- Employment: High\n- Drug Use: Low\n- Mental Health: Low\n- Living Situation: Low\n- Education: Low\n- Family Background: Low\n\nThe high risk from unemployment is a significant concern, but the presence of strong protective factors like marriage and no substance abuse might mitigate that. \n\nLooking at similar cases in the examples:\n\nExample 27 had multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, and some depression leading to YES.\n\nOur case has fewer risk factors except for unemployment. Example 30 had unemployment but predicted NO because other factors were positive.\n\nI think the combination of medium risk from prior record and high from unemployment is offset by the low risks elsewhere, making the overall prediction lean towards NO, with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests/convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a moderate risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse provides stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both biological parents reduces risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
