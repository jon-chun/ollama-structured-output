    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The individual is a 22-year-old White male with one prior arrest but no conviction. He's living alone, has a GED, isn't in college, held two jobs, used marijuana, and sometimes feels down.\n\nFirst, looking at the age factor: being young often correlates with higher impulsivity, which can increase recidivism risk. However, he's not extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHis single arrest without conviction might indicate a lower risk since there's no official record, but it's still a red flag, so low to medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which is a known risk factor. This seems like a medium risk because isolation can contribute to recidivism if not balanced with positive influences.\n\nHaving a GED shows he has some education, which usually reduces recidivism, but not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, so maybe low risk here.\n\nEmployment history: holding two jobs suggests stability and responsibility. Steady employment is a protective factor against recidivism, so this would be a low risk.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is a concern because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior. However, it's not as severe as harder drugs, so medium risk.\n\nHis occasional feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues that might increase recidivism if untreated. This adds some risk, perhaps medium.\n\nFamily background: living with both biological parents in a large household (size 10) suggests stability and support, which is positive. So low risk here.\n\nBelief in God can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and reducing recidivism tendencies, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher risks are around his age, living situation, drug use, and mental health. But he has stable employment and family support. The examples show that similar cases with some medium factors often result in \"NO\" prediction, especially if protective factors are present.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults may have higher impulsivity which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate less social support, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED reduces recidivism risk compared to those without any diploma or equivalent.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Steady employment is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can contribute to criminal behavior but is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs that increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents suggests a stable upbringing which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
