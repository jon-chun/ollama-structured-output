    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors and examples. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors given in the case:\n\n1. **Age**: 21 years old.\n2. **Gender**: Female.\n3. **Race**: White.\n4. **Arrest History**: Arrested 2 times but not convicted.\n5. **Height and Weight**: 5'2\" and 160 lbs.\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married.\n7. **Living Situation**: Living alone.\n8. **Education**: High school diploma, enrolled in a 2-year college.\n9. **Employment**: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n10. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n11. **Mental Health**: Felt down most of the time in the past month.\n12. **Family Background**: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in a rural area.\n13. **Religious Beliefs**: Doesn't consider God's influence on her life.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign a weight based on how much it contributes to recidivism risk. I'll use low, medium, or high.\n\n1. **Age (21)**: Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they might not have established stability yet. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\n2. **Arrest History (2 arrests without conviction)**: Having multiple arrests even without convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that's risky. This could be a medium to high risk factor.\n\n3. **Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine)**: Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it's linked to criminal behavior. Using more than one drug (poly-drug use) increases the risk, so this should be high.\n\n4. **Mental Health Issues**: Feeling down most of the time suggests possible depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental health can lead to higher recidivism, so medium to high risk.\n\n5. **Living Alone**: Living alone might mean less social support, which could contribute to recidivism. Medium risk.\n\n6. **Employment (2 jobs)**: Having multiple jobs could indicate instability or a struggle to maintain employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Maybe medium.\n\n7. **Education (HS diploma and in college)**: Education generally reduces recidivism as it provides stability and opportunities. So this might be a low risk factor, but since she's only in a 2-year program, maybe medium.\n\n8. **Family Background (stable with both parents)**: A stable family background usually lowers recidivism risk. This would be low.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs (no influence)**: Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing support and structure. Lack of it might slightly increase risk, but I'm not sure how significant this is\u2014maybe low.\n\n10. **Rural Area**: Living in a rural area could have mixed effects. Maybe less access to resources, which could be a medium risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks are drug use and mental health issues, followed by arrest history and employment instability. The stable family background and education are protective factors but might not outweigh the higher-risk elements. \n\nLooking at the examples provided, cases with multiple high-risk factors like drug use, mental health issues, and prior arrests often resulted in a YES prediction for recidivism. However, some cases with similar factors also had NO predictions if there were strong protective factors.\n\nIn this case, despite having stable family and education, the presence of significant risk factors might still lead to a higher likelihood of rearrest. So, I think the prediction is YES, but my confidence isn't 100% because there are mitigating factors as well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may lack stability, indicating moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History (2 arrests without conviction)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a concerning behavior pattern, despite no convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Poly-drug use significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression can lead to higher recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Less social support may contribute moderately to risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education (HS diploma and in college)\", \"low\", \"Education typically reduces risk, though the 2-year program is ongoing.\"),\n    (\"Family Background (stable with both parents)\", \"low\", \"Stable family lowers risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs (no influence)\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious support might slightly increase risk but isn't significant.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": \"70%\"\n}\n```",
