    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old White male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates. However, being in the early twenties isn't extremely high risk on its own.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might lower the risk because it suggests maybe it wasn't a serious offense or there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here, so that's probably a low factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support system, which might increase recidivism, but being enrolled in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities. That might lower the risk.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is good, but being enrolled in a 4-year college indicates he's actively pursuing education, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nHolding two jobs shows responsibility and stability, which are positive signs reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nDrug use with both marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Cocaine is a harder drug and can be associated with more serious issues, so this might increase his risk significantly.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is positive because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to recidivism if not managed.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child could indicate instability in his upbringing, which might raise the risk. Growing up in an urban area might also have higher crime exposure compared to rural areas.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his life might provide a support system or positive influence, lowering recidivism chances.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some negative factors like drug use and unstable upbringing, the positives like education, employment, and social support might balance them out. So, I'm leaning towards a lower risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22 years old)\", \"low\", \"Younger age can be associated with higher recidivism rates, but 22 is not extremely high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests lower severity or circumstances that may not strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in 4-year college\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college suggests engagement in positive activities and lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held two jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment stability is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs, especially harder drugs like cocaine, increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Absence of current mental health issues reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lived with non-biological adults as a child\", \"medium\", \"Unstable upbringing may increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area might expose individuals to higher crime environments.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
