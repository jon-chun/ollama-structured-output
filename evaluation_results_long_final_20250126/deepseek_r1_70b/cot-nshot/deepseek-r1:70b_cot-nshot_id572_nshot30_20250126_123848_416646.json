    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. I have a case where I need to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years based on several risk factors. The examples provided earlier give me some guidance on how different factors contribute to recidivism.\n\nFirst, looking at the number of arrests and convictions: he has been arrested 3 times and convicted once. In the examples, multiple arrests were a red flag. For instance, in example 27, two arrests with a conviction led to a YES prediction. So three arrests here might be a high risk factor because it suggests a pattern.\n\nNext, age is 22. Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism compared to older ones since they might not have as much life stability yet. But in the examples, I didn't see a clear trend on age alone, so maybe medium.\n\nLiving situation: he's living alone and never married. In some examples, living alone wasn't directly linked, but being unmarried or single could indicate less social support, which might be a low to medium risk factor.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education can be protective against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Not having higher education might be a medium risk since it's better than not having a diploma, but not as good as further education.\n\nEmployment: held 3 jobs in the past year. Unstable employment is concerning. In example 27, holding multiple jobs was part of a high-risk profile leading to YES. So this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant factor; it's linked with higher recidivism rates as seen in several examples where drug use contributed to YES predictions. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nMental health: no depression reported, which is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. So this might lower the overall risk, but since he doesn't have issues, it's more of a low risk or even protective factor, though not explicitly stated in examples.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in a stable household. A supportive family environment usually reduces recidivism, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God important. In some cases, religious affiliation can provide support and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. So maybe a low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are drug use and multiple arrests/convictions, which are strong indicators. Employment instability adds to that. However, having a stable family background and education might mitigate some risks. But considering the weight of drug use and criminal history, I think the prediction leans towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest less social support, but it's not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but no college enrollment might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs suggests instability which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"A stable family background is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
