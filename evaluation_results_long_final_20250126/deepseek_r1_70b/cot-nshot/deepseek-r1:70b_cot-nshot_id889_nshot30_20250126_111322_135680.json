    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to break down this case step by step. I'm looking at a 21-year-old Black male with a significant arrest history\u201419 times arrested and convicted. That immediately stands out because in the examples provided, higher numbers of arrests and convictions were associated with a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. From the examples, lack of education often correlated with higher recidivism risk, possibly due to limited job opportunities and stability. So that's another negative factor here.\n\nHis employment status is concerning too; he hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment was a consistent high-risk factor in the provided cases because it can lead to instability and potentially criminal activity as a means of income.\n\nHe lives alone, which might indicate social isolation or lack of support structures. However, in some examples, living alone wasn't a major determinant unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or unemployment.\n\nSubstance use is present here\u2014marijuana use over the past four years. While not as severe as multiple drugs, consistent drug use can impair judgment and increase recidivism risk, though it might be a medium factor depending on severity.\n\nHis mental health shows some issues; he feels down sometimes, but it's not constant. This could contribute to his situation, maybe increasing the likelihood of reoffending if left unaddressed, so I'd rate this as low to medium.\n\nLiving in an urban area with a household size of 8 when young might indicate a challenging upbringing, possibly exposing him to higher crime environments. Household size itself isn't a direct factor, but the environment could be. However, without more context, it's hard to weigh this heavily.\n\nHis belief that God influences his life is an interesting factor. In some cases, religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. But in others, if misapplied, it might not have a significant impact. I'm unsure how much weight to give this; perhaps low.\n\nPutting all these together: high arrest/conviction history is a major red flag (high risk), lack of education and employment are significant (both high), substance use and mental health are moderate risks, living situation and upbringing are context but maybe medium or lower. Religious beliefs might slightly mitigate but not enough to outweigh the other factors.\n\nComparing to examples, cases with multiple high-risk factors like high arrests, unemployment, and no education usually predicted \"YES\" with high confidence. So I'm leaning towards a YES prediction with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk demographic but not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being Black may reflect systemic biases but isn't a direct risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"19 arrests indicate a significant criminal history and high recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests serious offenses and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is less relevant unless indicating health issues, which isn't specified here.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married could imply social instability but not a strong indicator alone.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate isolation but isn't a major factor without other signs.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED is a known risk factor for recidivism, linked to fewer opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed with no jobs in the past year points to instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than multiple drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Some depression symptoms could affect behavior but are not as significant as other factors.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a large household may indicate challenging environment but isn't definitive.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence might provide support, potentially reducing risk slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
