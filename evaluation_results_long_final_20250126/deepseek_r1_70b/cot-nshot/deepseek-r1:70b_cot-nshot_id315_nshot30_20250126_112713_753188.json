    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years based on their risk factors. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. From the examples, younger people might have a higher risk because they're still in a phase where impulsive behavior is more common. But I'm not sure if 21 is considered high or medium. Maybe medium since it's on the lower side of adulthood but not a teenager.\n\nNext, number of arrests: he's been arrested twice and has a conviction. That seems significant. In the examples, multiple arrests often led to higher risk predictions. So this should be a high-risk factor because prior offenses are strong indicators.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. I don't recall any examples where physical stature played a role in recidivism, so I'll consider that low or maybe ignore it.\n\nMarital status: he's never married. Some studies suggest that being married can reduce recidivism because of stability, but in the provided cases, marital status didn't seem to be a major factor. Maybe medium, as single people might have less social support.\n\nLiving situation: living alone could mean less supervision or support, which might increase risk. In some examples, living alone was associated with higher recidivism, so I'll mark that as medium.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can provide stability and opportunities, so not pursuing further education might be a risk. Medium because having a diploma is good, but not continuing could limit his options.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the past year. Employment generally reduces recidivism as it provides structure and income. However, having multiple jobs might indicate instability. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impulsive behavior or relapse into criminal activity. This should be high.\n\nMental health: no depression reported, so that's a positive sign. Lower risk here.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background usually reduces risk, but urban environments might have higher crime rates. Maybe medium because the environment could pose some risk despite stable upbringing.\n\nReligious beliefs: considering God's influence can provide moral support and reduce recidivism. So this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors are prior convictions and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, education level, employment instability, family environment. Lower risks are marital status and religious beliefs. The combination leans towards higher risk but not the highest because there are some protective factors like stable upbringing and current lack of depression.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to impulsive behavior, but 21 is on the lower end of adulthood.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (2) and conviction\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending based on prior criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might reduce social support and supervision, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"medium\", \"Having multiple jobs may indicate instability, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to impulsive behavior or relapse into criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Family background (both biological parents)\", \"low\", \"A stable family background typically reduces recidivism risk, though urban environments might pose some challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
