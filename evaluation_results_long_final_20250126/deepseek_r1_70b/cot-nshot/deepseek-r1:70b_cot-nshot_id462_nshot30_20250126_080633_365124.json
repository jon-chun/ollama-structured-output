    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 19-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males, seem to have a higher likelihood of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and are in a phase where they're more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Multiple arrests without convictions could indicate either that he's been involved in criminal activities multiple times, or perhaps the charges didn't stick each time. Either way, two arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that might continue, so this is a medium risk factor because it shows some tendency towards recidivism but not as severe as if he had prior convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 1 inch and between 150-174 lbs. I don't see any examples where physical size was a significant factor, so maybe this isn't very relevant. It might be more about whether size relates to certain types of crimes, but without specific info, it's probably low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes mean less supervision or support, which could contribute to higher risk if he doesn't have a strong social network to deter criminal behavior. However, in the examples, marital status didn't play a huge role unless combined with other factors like employment or education. So I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often a protective factor against recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and stability. Not having higher education might limit his options, increasing the likelihood of returning to criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, providing income and structure. Having multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk for recidivism because unemployment is linked to higher rearrest rates. So this might be a medium risk as well.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is present. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism since it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior to support drug habits. However, marijuana is generally considered less severe than harder drugs, so I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe's felt down some of the time recently. Mental health issues, especially depression or low mood, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse, which in turn increases recidivism risk. This seems like a medium factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area during youth. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, but living with a biological parent suggests some level of family support, which can be protective. However, the urban setting could still pose risks, so I'll consider this low risk because family presence might mitigate it.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and community support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: High for age, medium for arrests without convictions, maybe some mediums elsewhere. But looking at the examples, when there are multiple medium factors, especially with younger individuals and substance use, it tends towards YES. However, he has a GED and some employment, which might lower the risk. The presence of mental health issues could tip it higher.\n\nI think the prediction is YES because several medium factors add up, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19 years)\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without convictions (2 times)\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior, but lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses or successful legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, potentially increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"GED and no college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Lower educational attainment can limit job opportunities, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might indicate higher risk, though employment generally reduces recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is a known risk factor for recidivism, though marijuana is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"Mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of depression can increase risky behavior and substance abuse, raising recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Urban upbringing with biological mother\", \"low\", \"Family support may mitigate the higher crime exposure in urban areas.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can provide stabilizing influences and community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
