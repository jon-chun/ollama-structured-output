    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Hispanic male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their weights.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals seem to have a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control or life stability yet. So I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction could indicate a lower risk since it wasn't severe enough for a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHis height and weight (6'1\", 210 lbs) don't directly relate to recidivism unless size is linked to specific crimes, like assault. Without more context, I'll consider this low risk.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate independence but could also mean less support or supervision, which can be a medium risk factor because without a strong support system, he might be more likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nHaving a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a positive sign. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this should be low risk.\n\nHolding five jobs in a year suggests instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Job instability can be a medium risk factor because it might indicate issues with responsibility or could lead to financial stress that increases criminal behavior likelihood.\n\nDrug use, especially with both marijuana and cocaine, is a significant concern. Drug abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism since it's often linked to criminal activity either directly or through impaired judgment. This would be high risk.\n\nFeeling down sometimes in the past month could indicate mental health issues, which might increase recidivism if not addressed. However, it's only \"some of the time,\" so maybe medium risk.\n\nLiving with just his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a parent might provide some stability. This could be low or medium; I'll lean towards medium because urban areas have more risks.\n\nBelieving that God influences his life could be protective, providing a sense of purpose and community support, which lowers recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are age and drug use, medium ones include arrest history, living situation, job instability, mental health, and urban environment. Positive factors like education and religious belief are low. The presence of multiple high and medium risks suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest, but the positive factors might mitigate some risk. Comparing to examples where similar profiles had both YES and NO outcomes, I'm leaning towards predicting YES with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 1 time but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"While an arrest indicates potential criminal activity, the lack of conviction may reduce the immediate risk.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight (6'1\\\" 210 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism without context suggesting related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age might indicate less support or supervision, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism as it provides stability and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Held 5 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate issues with responsibility or lead to financial stress increasing criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism due to its link with impaired judgment and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Felt down some of the time in the past month\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated, though this is only occasional here.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban household of 2\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates, but living with a parent provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences his life\", \"low\", \"Religious belief can provide a sense of purpose and community support, lowering recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
