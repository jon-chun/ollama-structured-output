    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 22. In the examples, younger individuals (like 19-23) sometimes have higher recidivism rates, but it can vary. I'll consider her youth as a medium risk because while young, she's not a minor anymore.\n\nShe's female. From the examples, females don't seem to have a high correlation with rearrest compared to males, so maybe low risk here.\n\nArrested once and convicted: that's a significant factor. A prior conviction often increases recidivism chances, so I think this is a medium to high risk. It shows she's had legal trouble before.\n\nHeight and weight (5'3\", 155 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism, so low risk there.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. In the examples, being married or in a stable relationship often lowers recidivism because of support systems, so I'll mark that as low risk.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can lower recidivism by providing job opportunities, so not having higher education might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Stable employment is generally a protective factor against recidivism, so this should be low risk.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can be a risk. I'll categorize this as medium because it's a common substance and may indicate potential issues.\n\nNo depression reported is positive; mental health struggles can increase recidivism, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a low risk factor.\n\nLiving in a rural area with her biological mother during youth: Rural areas might have fewer resources or higher crime rates. However, living with a biological parent usually provides stability, so this is probably low risk.\n\nBelieves God influences her life: In some cases, religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing support and moral guidance, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the highest risks are the prior conviction (medium-high) and drug use (medium). However, she has several protective factors like marriage, stable employment, and religious beliefs. The examples show cases with similar or higher risk factors sometimes resulting in NO. So, I think her overall prediction is likely NO with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young but not a minor, which could indicate some impulsivity but also potential for rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrested once and convicted\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates past involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not typically correlated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"married and living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"high school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history reduces the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates responsibility and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"used drugs (marijuana) in past four years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can contribute to criminal behavior, but marijuana is generally considered lower risk compared to other substances.\"),\n    (\"no depression reported\", \"low\", \"The absence of reported mental health issues reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lived with biological mother in rural area\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent during youth provides stability, and rural areas may have lower crime rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
