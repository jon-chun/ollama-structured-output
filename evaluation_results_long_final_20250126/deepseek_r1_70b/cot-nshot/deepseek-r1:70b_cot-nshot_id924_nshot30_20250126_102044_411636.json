    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the provided examples. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old Hispanic male with two arrests and one conviction. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, seem to be a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. So I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which in the examples often correlates with higher risk because it can limit employment opportunities and stability. This factor should also be high.\n\nLiving alone might indicate less social support, but it's not as directly linked to recidivism as other factors, so I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe held two jobs in a year, which could mean instability or transient employment. However, having some employment history isn't as risky as unemployment, so maybe low or medium. But given the context of other high-risk factors, perhaps medium is more appropriate here.\n\nDrug use, especially with both marijuana and cocaine, is a significant factor. In the examples, drug use often leads to higher recidivism risk, so this should be high.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign, but since he's used drugs, that might still contribute to higher risk, though maybe not as much as if he were depressed. So I'll keep it low for mental health.\n\nLiving in a rural area with his biological mother could mean some family support, which is a protective factor. However, the household size of five isn't particularly large or small enough to be a major factor on its own, so maybe medium here.\n\nA lack of belief in God might reduce participation in religious programs that can aid rehabilitation, but this factor seems less directly impactful compared to others. So I'll assign it low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high-risk elements like multiple arrests, conviction, no diploma, and drug use are strong predictors. Despite some medium and low factors, the overall risk seems high. Looking at similar examples where such combinations led to a YES prediction, I think this case would result in a YES with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years old)\", \"low\", \"Being young can be a risk factor for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life experience.\"),\n    (\"Gender (male)\", \"medium\", \"Males historically have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity (Hispanic)\", \"low\", \"No specific correlation with recidivism in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Number of arrests (2 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a more serious history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (never married)\", \"low\", \"While marital status can influence stability, it is not a strong predictor here.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education (no high school diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism as it limits employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment (held 2 jobs in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Job instability may contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (no depression reported)\", \"low\", \"Absence of reported mental health issues reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Family background (lived with biological mother)\", \"medium\", \"Having a stable family background can reduce recidivism risk, but living in a rural area may limit resources.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs (does not believe in God)\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce access to certain support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
