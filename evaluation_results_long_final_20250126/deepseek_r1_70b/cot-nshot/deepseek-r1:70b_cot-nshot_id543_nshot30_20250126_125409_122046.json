    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given case and predict whether the person will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old White male. Age can be a significant factor because younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism. Being young might mean less life stability and more impulsive behavior.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't lead to a formal record, which might deter future offenses. However, the fact that he was arrested at all shows some level of involvement in criminal activity.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 220 lbs. While this doesn't directly relate to recidivism, physical stature could influence interactions with law enforcement or peers, but it's probably a low factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor because having a supportive environment is known to reduce recidivism. However, not being married at 18 isn't unusual, so maybe this isn't too significant.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job stability is important; frequent job changes can indicate instability or issues with employment, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending if he can't find steady work. So this seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor. Substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk significantly.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this is a low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor against crime. Growing up in an urban area might have higher crime exposure, but his family support likely mitigates that, so this is a low risk.\n\nBelieves God has influence in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The main risks are his young age, single arrest without conviction (which might not have as much deterrent effect), job instability, and living alone with less social support. However, he has strong protective factors like stable upbringing, no drug use, and religious beliefs. Most examples with similar profiles didn't result in rearrest, so I'm leaning towards a low risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate lower risk as it didn't lead to a formal record, which can deter future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight (6'0\\\", 220 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical stature is not a significant direct factor in recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Having an education is protective, but not continuing it might limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"3 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate issues with employment, potentially increasing recidivism risk if steady work isn't found.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of substance abuse is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Current mental health stability reduces the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Stable family upbringing with biological parents\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment is protective against criminal behavior despite urban setting.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious influence can provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
