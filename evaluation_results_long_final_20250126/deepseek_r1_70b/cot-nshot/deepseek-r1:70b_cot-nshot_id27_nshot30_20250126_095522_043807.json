    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 21-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years. Let me look at each risk factor and see how they might influence the outcome.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That could mean a few things\u2014maybe it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake. In the examples, people with one arrest sometimes had lower risk, especially without a conviction. So maybe that's a medium risk factor because while an arrest is a concern, no conviction might indicate less severity.\n\nNext, her age is 21. From what I've seen in the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates. Young adults are still developing and might be more impulsive or influenced by peers. So this could be a medium-high risk factor.\n\nShe's living alone. In some cases, living alone was associated with higher risk, maybe because of less support or supervision. But in other examples, it didn't seem to be a major factor. I'm not sure how significant this is, so I'll mark it as low for now.\n\nHer education level is a GED, which is better than not having one, but lower than a high school diploma. Lower education can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism because of limited job opportunities. This might be a medium risk factor since she's not enrolled in college either, which could mean fewer stable opportunities.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Having multiple jobs might indicate responsibility or instability. Maybe it's a medium factor because while having jobs is good, frequent changes could suggest issues.\n\nDrug use is a big one here\u2014she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior to support habits. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHer mental state: she's felt down constantly in the past month, which could indicate severe depression or anxiety. Mental health issues, especially if untreated, can increase the risk of reoffending through impulsive behaviors or substance abuse as self-medication. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a stable household. A supportive family background usually reduces recidivism risk, so this might be a low-risk factor.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with her life might provide emotional support and reduce recidivism. Religious involvement can be a protective factor, so maybe a low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high risks from drug use and mental health issues are significant predictors. Medium factors like age and job instability add to the risk. Protective factors like family background and religious beliefs might lower it a bit, but the overall picture leans towards higher recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested once but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"First-time arrest without conviction may indicate lower severity or a minor offense, but still a concern.\"),\n    (\"age 21\", \"high\", \"Young adults are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate independence but isn't strongly linked to recidivism without other factors.\"),\n    (\"GED certificate, not in college\", \"medium\", \"Lower educational attainment can limit opportunities, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs\", \"medium\", \"Employment is stabilizing, but frequent job changes could signal instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism due to associated behaviors.\"),\n    (\"severe depression\", \"high\", \"Untreated mental health issues can lead to impulsive or self-destructive behavior.\"),\n    (\"stable family background\", \"low\", \"Supportive upbringing reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide emotional support and reduce risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
