    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old Hispanic male with several factors to consider.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested seven times but not convicted. That's a red flag because multiple arrests suggest frequent interactions with the law, even if convictions aren't there yet. This could indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to future issues, so I'll rate this as high risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 215 lbs. While being physically large doesn't directly cause recidivism, it might influence his interactions with law enforcement or his ability to intimidate others, which could be a factor in certain crimes. However, without more context, I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone right now. His marital status might not directly impact recidivism, but living with others could provide stability or support. On the other hand, if he's in an unstable environment, that could be a risk. I'm leaning towards low risk here because living with family might offer some structure.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually a positive factor as it can lead to better opportunities and stability. This suggests he's taking steps towards a more stable life, which would lower his recidivism risk. So, I'll consider this a low risk.\n\nHaving held only one job in the past year might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a medium risk because it's not a long-term issue yet but could become one if it continues.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor as it might impair judgment or lead to criminal activity. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression are reported, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this isn't a concern now. So, low risk in this area.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four as a child suggests a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor against recidivism. Stable family environments usually help individuals stay on the right path, so I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens in his life. Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests is concerning, but he has positive factors like education and religious beliefs that might mitigate risks. Employment instability and drug use are moderate concerns. Overall, I think the positives might outweigh the negatives here, leading me to predict no recidivism with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"7 arrests without conviction indicates frequent legal issues\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"medium\", \"Large build could influence interactions but not directly tied to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a diploma and being enrolled suggests positive engagement\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job in the past year might indicate instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported, lowering risk\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"low\", \"Stable family background reduces risk\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide moral support and reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
