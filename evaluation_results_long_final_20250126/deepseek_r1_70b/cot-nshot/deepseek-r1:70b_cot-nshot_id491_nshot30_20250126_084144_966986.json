    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 20-year-old White male will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me break down each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher likelihood of recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nNext, he's been arrested once but not convicted. In some cases, a lack of conviction might mean less severe charges or first-time offender programs, which could reduce the likelihood of rearrest. But since he was arrested, it still indicates some involvement in criminal activity, so maybe low to medium risk here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so that's probably a non-factor, or at most low risk.\n\nHe's never been married, which is pretty common for someone his age. Unmarried status can sometimes correlate with less stability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I might consider this as low risk.\n\nHe's currently not living alone, which could mean he has a support system or is under supervision, potentially reducing the risk of rearrest. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is significant because education level often correlates with employment opportunities and stability. Lower educational attainment can lead to higher recidivism rates, so I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Stable employment is generally a protective factor against recidivism, so having at least one job might lower his risk compared to someone unemployed. This seems like low risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs suggests he's less likely to reoffend. That's definitely a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which means mental health issues might not be driving his behavior. Mental health can influence recidivism, but since he isn't experiencing depression now, it's probably a low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a household of size four in a rural area could mean he has family support, which is beneficial. Rural areas might have different dynamics\u2014sometimes less access to services, but also potentially stronger community ties. I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHe believes that God influences his life, which can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing recidivism risks. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the medium factors are age and lack of education, while most others are low. The presence of supportive family, employment, no drug use, and religious beliefs suggest lower overall risk. However, his youth and educational background still pose some concern. Looking at similar cases in the examples, many with these profiles leaned towards \"NO\" for rearrest. So I'm predicting \"NO\" with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (20)\", \"medium\", \"Younger age is associated with higher recidivism risk as individuals may still be in a high-risk phase of life.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 1 time, not convicted\", \"low\", \"First-time arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (5'9\\\", 145 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"low\", \"Marital status at this age is less relevant; young individuals are often single.\"),\n    (\"Not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with others may indicate social support, reducing isolation-related risks.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job in the past year\", \"low\", \"Employment suggests stability and reduces recidivism risk compared to unemployment.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of substance abuse lowers the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"No depression in the past month\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability reduces recidivism risk factors associated with emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological dad in rural area\", \"low\", \"Family support and stable living environment reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
