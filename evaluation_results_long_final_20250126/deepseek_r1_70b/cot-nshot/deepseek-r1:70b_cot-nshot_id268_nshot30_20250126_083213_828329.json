    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to predict whether a specific individual will be rearrested within three years based on various risk factors. The user has provided several examples (n-shot learning) of similar cases with their outcomes, and I need to use that information along with assigning weights to each risk factor in the current case.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing all the risk factors present in the new case:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old.\n2. Ethnicity: Hispanic.\n3. Arrest history: Arrested 4 times, convicted.\n4. Height and weight: 5'8\", 190 lbs.\n5. Marital status: Never married.\n6. Living situation: Currently living alone.\n7. Education: High school diploma but not enrolled in college.\n8. Employment: Held 3 jobs during the year.\n9. Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years.\n10. Mental health: No depression reported.\n11. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area.\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God has influence.\n\nNow, I'll go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight (low, medium, high) based on the examples provided. \n\n1. **Age (21):** From the examples, younger individuals seem to have varying outcomes. For instance, example 27 involved a 22-year-old with multiple arrests leading to YES. But age alone isn't a strong predictor; it might be medium.\n\n2. **Ethnicity (Hispanic):** The examples don't show a clear trend based on ethnicity, so this might be low impact.\n\n3. **Arrest history (4 times, convicted):** This is significant. More arrests and convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. High weight.\n\n4. **Height/weight:** Physical attributes like height and weight aren't directly linked to recidivism in the examples, so low impact.\n\n5. **Marital status (never married):** Some examples show unmarried individuals with YES outcomes, but it's not a strong factor on its own. Maybe medium.\n\n6. **Living alone:** Living alone appears in some cases with both YES and NO outcomes. Perhaps medium.\n\n7. **Education (high school diploma, no college):** Having a high school diploma is better than not having one, which might reduce recidivism. But not being enrolled could be a neutral factor. Maybe low.\n\n8. **Employment (3 jobs):** Multiple jobs suggest instability or perhaps an attempt to improve circumstances. Could be medium as job stability is a factor.\n\n9. **Drug use (marijuana):** Drug use, especially ongoing, is a known risk factor for recidivism. High weight.\n\n10. **Mental health (no depression):** No reported issues here, which is positive. Low risk.\n\n11. **Family background (both parents in urban area):** Stable family background might reduce risk. Low impact.\n\n12. **Religious beliefs:** Some examples show belief in God as a protective factor. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors are arrest history and drug use, both high. Employment and marital status are mediums but not as impactful. The rest are low or have mixed effects. \n\nLooking at the provided examples, cases with multiple arrests and convictions often result in YES (e.g., example 27). Drug use also correlates with higher recidivism. However, factors like stable family background and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk.\n\nBut considering the high weight of arrest history and drug use, despite other mitigating factors, it's likely to lean towards a YES prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 is young but not particularly high risk on its own\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity has no clear correlation with recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and conviction indicate high likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"No correlation with recidivism observed\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married could indicate instability but not strongly predictive\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is common across examples without clear trend\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is neutral, not a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"3 jobs suggest some stability or possible instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use in past four years increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces this risk factor\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may reduce recidivism risk slightly\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
