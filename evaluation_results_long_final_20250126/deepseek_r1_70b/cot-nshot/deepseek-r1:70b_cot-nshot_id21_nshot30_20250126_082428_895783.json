    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old Hispanic male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests and convictions seem to increase recidivism risk. For instance, Example 27 had two arrests and a conviction leading to a YES prediction. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, might have higher recidivism rates as they're still developing. However, it's not the highest risk factor on its own unless combined with other issues.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor against recidivism. In the examples, being married or in a stable relationship wasn't highlighted much, but generally, support systems can reduce risk. So I might rate this as low risk.\n\nHis education is a GED certificate, not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism because it can limit job opportunities. This seems like a medium-risk factor since it's not the lowest level (like no diploma) but still indicates some disadvantage.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Employment stability is crucial; having only one job might indicate instability, which could increase recidivism risk. But compared to someone with multiple jobs or none, this might be a medium factor.\n\nDrug use is marijuana over four years. Marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but chronic use can still lead to legal issues. This seems like a low to medium risk depending on frequency and impact.\n\nHe's felt down some of the time recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, as they might lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse. I'd rate this as medium risk because it's not constant but still present.\n\nLiving situation at a young age in a household size of four isn't particularly risky on its own unless there were other negative factors, which aren't mentioned here. So low risk.\n\nBelieves God has influence\u2014spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing support and reducing risky behaviors. So maybe a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are multiple arrests/convictions and maybe mental health. Medium factors include employment instability and drug use. Low factors include age, marital status, education, living situation, and beliefs. The high and medium factors might tip the prediction towards YES, but since some protective factors exist (marriage, belief), confidence isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is young but not the highest risk factor alone without other issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital status/stable relationship\", \"low\", \"Being married can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate suggests lower educational attainment, potentially limiting job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having one job in the past year may indicate some instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is less severe but still a factor if it leads to legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at young age\", \"low\", \"Household size of four without negative factors isn't risky.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spirituality may provide support and reduce risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
