    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. From the examples, younger males, especially those without stable education or employment, might have higher recidivism rates. His age could be a medium risk because he's young but not necessarily in a high-risk group yet.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. In some examples, a single arrest without conviction didn't always lead to a \"YES\" outcome, so maybe this is low risk. But I should consider it as medium because any arrest can indicate potential issues.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here, so that's probably a non-factor or low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone might contribute to isolation, but in the examples, marital status didn't heavily influence outcomes. So maybe this is low risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a significant factor. Many examples where individuals lacked education had higher recidivism rates. This should be high risk because it limits job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year, which shows some employment history. Employment can be protective against recidivism, so this might be low or medium risk. Since he has a job, maybe it's a positive sign, but not strong enough to outweigh other factors.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) is present, and substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism. However, marijuana alone isn't as severe as harder drugs. Still, it's a medium risk because drug use can lead to further issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower psychological risk factors. But if he had other mental health issues, that could be different. So maybe this is low or not applicable here.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area: Stable family background usually reduces risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but living with parents can be protective. Maybe medium risk because of the environment, but the family support lowers it a bit.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which in some examples was associated with higher recidivism. This could be a low or medium risk factor depending on how much influence spirituality has on behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: High risks are lack of education and perhaps living in an urban area. Medium risks include his age, single arrest, drug use, and atheism. Low risks are employment history, no depression, and stable family background.\n\nI think the high risk factors might tip the prediction towards \"YES,\" but I'm not entirely sure because he has some protective factors like a job and living with parents. So my confidence isn't super high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be associated with higher impulsivity but also potential for change.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may not strongly indicate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism as it limits opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employed (2 jobs in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism risk, but frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"low\", \"While substance abuse is a risk factor, marijuana use alone is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological parents\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Urban residence\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime exposure but also more resources.\"),\n    (\"No depression reported\", \"low\", \"Mental health issues are a risk factor, and their absence is protective.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
