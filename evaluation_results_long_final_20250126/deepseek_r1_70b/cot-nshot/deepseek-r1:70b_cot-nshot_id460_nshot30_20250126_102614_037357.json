    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger people seem to have a higher risk because they might be more impulsive or still developing. So I'd say that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has only been arrested once and hasn't been convicted yet. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, led to higher risks. Since he's only got one arrest without conviction, this seems lower risk, maybe low.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem to correlate directly with recidivism in the examples, so I'll consider that a low factor.\n\nHe's never been married, which might mean less stability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. The examples didn't emphasize marital status much, so medium risk here.\n\nLiving situation: he's currently not living alone. In some cases, living with others can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this might be a lower risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than no diploma but not as good as a high school diploma or college enrollment. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so I'd rate this medium.\n\nNot being enrolled in college could mean less engagement in positive activities, but having a GED might offset that a bit. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so high here.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine. Both are linked to higher recidivism rates because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior. High risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if untreated. Since he hasn't felt depressed, this might be a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a youth: stable family environment is good, but urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates. This could go either way, but I'll say medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his actions. In the examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower recidivism because they can provide moral guidance and support networks. So not having that might be a higher risk, medium.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are employment instability and drug use; mediums include age, living situation, education level, not in college, family environment, and atheism. Lows are single arrest, no depression, height/weight. The high factors, especially job instability and drug use, along with several mediums, might push the prediction towards YES, but I'm only 65% confident because some factors like one arrest and stable living situation could lower the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (20)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time, not convicted\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"height/weight (6'0\\\", 204 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not strongly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"never married\", \"medium\", \"Marital status can indicate stability, but being unmarried at a young age is common and not a strong indicator of risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation (not alone)\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED, not in college\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is better than no diploma, but not being enrolled in further education could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"4 jobs in past year\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or difficulties with employment, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"no depression in past month\", \"low\", \"Current mental health stability reduces the risk compared to active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"lived with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Stable family environment is positive, but urban areas may have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"doesn't believe God influences actions\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious beliefs may reduce access to support networks that can prevent recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
