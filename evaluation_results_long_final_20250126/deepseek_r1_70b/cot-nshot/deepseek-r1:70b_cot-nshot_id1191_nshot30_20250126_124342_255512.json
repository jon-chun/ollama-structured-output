    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's 22 years old. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates. So I'll mark this as a high-risk factor because it's associated with impulsive behavior and less life stability.\n\nNext, number of arrests: He has two prior arrests and one conviction. The examples show that multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future offenses. This should be a high risk because it indicates a pattern of criminal activity.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here, so I'll skip those as low risk factors. They don't correlate with recidivism in the provided cases.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married. The examples suggest that being unmarried can be linked to higher recidivism due to less social support and stability. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation: Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might mean fewer opportunities. However, education alone isn't the strongest predictor here, so I'll consider it low risk.\n\nEmployment history: He's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it may indicate limited financial stability or responsibility. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism because it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might reduce some risks, but I'll still mark this as high due to the substance use.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nFamily background: Growing up with his biological mother in an urban area of size five doesn't stand out as particularly risky compared to other cases where family instability was more pronounced. So this is low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believing that God influences his actions might provide some moral framework, which could be a protective factor against recidivism. So I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age and drug use, with several medium factors. Comparing to examples where similar profiles led to YES predictions when multiple high risks were present. However, since he's employed and has some stability, it might lower the risk a bit. But considering two prior arrests and conviction, along with ongoing drug use, I think the prediction leans towards YES, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of some mitigating factors like education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"22 years old is considered young and associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"2 prior arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"never married could indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"has high school diploma, which is positive\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"held 1 job in the past year may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"marijuana use can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone might reduce social support\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing with biological mother\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide moral framework\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
