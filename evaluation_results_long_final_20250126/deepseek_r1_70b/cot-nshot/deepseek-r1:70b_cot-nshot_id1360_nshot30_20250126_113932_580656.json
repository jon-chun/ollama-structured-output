    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me start by analyzing each risk factor and assigning a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age: The individual is 22 years old. Looking at the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. So I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNext, race isn't typically a direct factor, but in some contexts, it might correlate with systemic issues. However, without explicit examples tying race directly to recidivism, I won't weigh this heavily. Maybe low.\n\nShe's been arrested twice without conviction. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially unconvicted, sometimes led to higher risk because it indicates repeated run-ins with the law. But since there were no convictions, maybe medium.\n\nHer height is 5'7\", which doesn't seem relevant, so I'll ignore that or mark it as low.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. In some cases, being unmarried and living alone was associated with higher risk, possibly due to less stable support systems. So medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This is a significant factor because lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. High weight here.\n\nNot enrolled in college and held no jobs during the year. Unemployment and lack of education are strong indicators. She has no job, which likely increases risk. So high for unemployment.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe medium.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but she hasn't felt depressed recently, so this might be a protective factor. Low risk here.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a small household (size 2). A stable family environment could reduce risk, but the small size might indicate limited support. Maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism as they can provide support and structure. So this is a positive factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The high-risk factors are lack of education and unemployment. Medium factors include young age, multiple arrests, living situation, and drug use. Protective factors are no recent depression and religious beliefs. The combination leans towards higher risk but not the highest since some protective factors exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age (22 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism, though 22 is on the lower end for high risk.\"),\n    (\"race (Black)\", \"low\", \"While systemic factors can play a role, race itself isn't a direct indicator of recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"arrests (2 times, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions suggest ongoing legal issues but not necessarily a high likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status (never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and being unmarried may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education (no high school diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment (unemployed, no jobs held)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana in past 4 years)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is a risk factor but marijuana alone may not be as significant as other substances.\"),\n    (\"mental health (no recent depression)\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent mental health issues reduces immediate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation (with biological mother, household size 2)\", \"medium\", \"A stable living environment can reduce risk, though a smaller household may offer less support.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
