    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old White male. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but at 22, he's on the cusp. I'm not sure if age alone is high or low here, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate less severe offense or first-time mistake. So that could be a lower risk factor, maybe low.\n\nHis height and weight (6'4\", 157 lbs) don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider that as low impact.\n\nHe's never married, which is common at 22, but marital status isn't a strong indicator here. Probably low.\n\nNot living alone might mean he has family support, which can be a protective factor against recidivism. So maybe medium or low risk because support could help reduce it.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is concerning. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism due to limited job opportunities. This feels like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs in the past year, which shows instability. Job instability can lead to financial stress, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. That seems high risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) is present but not heavy. While drug use is a risk, marijuana alone might be lower compared to harder drugs. Maybe medium.\n\nNo recent depression is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\nLiving in a rural area with his biological mother suggests some family support and stability, which could be protective. So maybe low or medium risk.\n\nBelief in God might provide emotional support, reducing recidivism. That's probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are lack of education and job instability. Medium is drug use. Lows include single arrest, no depression, family support, belief, age, marital status. The high factors could lead to higher recidivism, but the protective factors might mitigate that. I'm leaning towards a lower risk overall, so prediction is NO with around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young but not particularly high risk for recidivism on its own.\"),\n    (\"arrested once but not convicted\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests lower severity or a first-time offense, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not directly correlated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"never married\", \"low\", \"Marital status is not a strong predictor of recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"not living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living with others could indicate social support, which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism as it limits employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"held 4 jobs in the past year\", \"high\", \"Job instability can indicate higher risk due to potential financial stress and instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is a risk factor, but marijuana use alone may not be as significant as other substances.\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent depressive symptoms reduces mental health-related recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"lived with biological mother in rural area\", \"medium\", \"Stable family environment could reduce risk, though rural areas may have limited resources.\"),\n    (\"believes God has something to do\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
