    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: She's 19, which is relatively young. From the examples, younger individuals might be at a higher risk because they're still developing and might have less stability. I'll assign this a medium weight since it's not extremely high but still a notable factor.\n\nNext, arrest history: She has one arrest without conviction. In the examples, prior arrests even without convictions sometimes led to higher recidivism if other factors were present. But here, it's just one arrest, so maybe low risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant for recidivism, so I won't consider that.\n\nMarital status: Never married. The examples didn't highlight this as a major factor, but being single might relate to less stability, which could be medium risk.\n\nLiving alone: This could indicate independence or possible isolation. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher recidivism if other factors were negative. So maybe medium here.\n\nEducation and employment: She has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college, which is positive. Education usually reduces recidivism risk. Also, holding two jobs suggests stability, so this should be low risk.\n\nDrug use: No drug use in the past four years, which is a strong positive indicator. Low risk here.\n\nMental health: She's felt down some of the time, but not constantly. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated, but since it's only some of the time, maybe medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God influences her life. In some cases, religion provides support and reduces recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher risks are age (medium), living alone (medium), mental health (medium). The rest are low or positive factors. Since there are more protective factors than risks, I think the prediction is NO with a confidence around 70.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is considered young but not particularly high risk on its own\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction could indicate some risk but is not conclusive\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might contribute to isolation or lack of support system\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are positive indicators\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Some feelings of depression could indicate potential issues if not addressed\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents suggests a stable upbringing\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
