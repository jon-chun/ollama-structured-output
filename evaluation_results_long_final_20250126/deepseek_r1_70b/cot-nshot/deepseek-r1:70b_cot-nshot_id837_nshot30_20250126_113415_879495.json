    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and might be influenced more by peers. So I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe's male. Statistically, males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females, so that's another high-risk factor.\n\nSingle arrest but with a conviction. Having a criminal record can lead to more arrests because it might limit job opportunities and increase surveillance from law enforcement. But since it's only one conviction, maybe medium risk.\n\nHis height is 6'3\" and weight between 175-199 lbs. Being physically large could make him more likely to engage in confrontations or be perceived as a threat, but I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe low risk because it's not directly linked to recidivism.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate instability or lack of support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This is a big one because education is a key factor in getting jobs and reducing recidivism. Without it, he might struggle to find stable employment, increasing the chance of rearrest. High risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to commit crimes again. So medium risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana. While less severe than harder drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase recidivism chances. Medium risk here because it's not as high as other substances but still a factor.\n\nHe's felt down most of the past month. Depression or mental health issues can lead to poor decision-making and increased risk of reoffending without proper support. High risk.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area. Rural areas might have fewer resources for rehabilitation, and a larger family could mean less individual attention or support. Medium risk.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. This can be a protective factor as religious beliefs sometimes reduce recidivism by providing a support network and moral framework. So low risk here because it's a positive influence.\n\nPutting this all together: high risks from age, gender, lack of education, mental health issues; medium risks from conviction, living situation, employment, drug use, household size; low from physical build and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors are significant but there are some mitigating factors too. So the prediction is YES with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years old)\", \"high\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Male gender\", \"high\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest and conviction\", \"medium\", \"A criminal record can limit opportunities and increase scrutiny, but one conviction is relatively low.\"),\n    (\"Height (6'3\\\") and weight (175-199 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical size may not significantly impact recidivism directly.\"),\n    (\"Living alone at 18\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age could indicate instability or lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism due to limited employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Held one job in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment history can lead to financial instability and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"Frequent feelings of depression\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism if untreated or poorly managed.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 in rural area\", \"medium\", \"Rural areas may have fewer resources and larger households could mean less individual support.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
