    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear sign of past criminal behavior, which is a high risk factor. So that's definitely a high weight because any prior offense significantly increases the chance of rearrest.\n\nHe's 5'3\" and weighs 170 lbs. While weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's underweight or overweight affecting health, here it doesn't stand out as particularly relevant. So maybe medium weight since it's just his height and weight, not an issue that would cause problems.\n\nNever married living alone adds some factors but in this case, he's never been married, so no spouse to potentially support him if he reoffenses. Since he's living alone, maybe a little risk from isolation leading to substance abuse or other issues, but it's lower than someone with a partner. So medium weight.\n\nGED certificate and not enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes mean less employable or maybe more prone to certain types of jobs that could lead to substance use or other issues. But since he's not in school, maybe the impact is lower compared to someone with no education. So low weight here because higher education usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism.\n\nNo jobs during the year means he has no steady income, which can increase the risk of engaging in risky behavior. Without a job, he might turn to drugs or other activities more frequently. So that's high risk.\n\nNot using any drugs and not feeling depressed is actually positive signs. Using substances can sometimes lead to more unstable behavior, but since he doesn't use them now, that's a low weight factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month either. Lack of mental health issues is good for recidivism rates. So low here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household size of 10 in a rural area. That seems like a lot of people living together, which might suggest higher support and stability, but it's also possible that such large households could lead to issues like neglect or substance abuse if not properly supervised. However, since it's a rural setting, maybe there's less supervision, so perhaps medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal events. This is interesting because religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with different behaviors, but in this case, he doesn't see a divine connection, which might reduce any stigma or self-blame associated with criminal behavior, potentially lowering recidivism risk. So low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior offense (high), living alone (medium), no job (high), GED (low), no drugs/depression (low), large household in rural area (medium), and belief in secular values (low). The highest risks are from prior arrest, no job, and the large household. But the other factors like not using substances or being in a GED slightly mitigate some of the risk.\n\nSo weighing these: Prior offense is high, no job is high, others are medium or low. So maybe a 60% confidence level leaning towards YES because two high factors but some mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several risk factors that lean towards higher recidivism risk, especially his prior arrest and lack of employment. While other factors like not using drugs and being in a GED slightly mitigate this, the overall assessment is moderately risky.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"_prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested once and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but could potentially lead to isolation issues affecting behavior if reoffending.\"),\n    (\"_no_job\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job during the year can increase vulnerability to engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to further arrest.\"),\n    (\"_ged Certificate\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate, though not enrolled in college, is generally associated with better employability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"_no_drugs\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs reduces the likelihood of substance abuse or related issues that can contribute to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"_no_depression\", \"low\", \"Lack of depression is a positive indicator as mental health issues are often linked to recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"_large_household_rural\", \"medium\", \"Living with 10 family members in a rural area may provide support but could also lack supervision, potentially increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"_god Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has no role in personal events may reduce stigma and self-blame associated with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
