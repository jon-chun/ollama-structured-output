    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which might indicate he's still developing, but that alone doesn't directly predict rearrest. His prior arrest count of 2 with a conviction suggests he has some history, so medium weight on that.\n\nHis height and weight are below average (5'5\"/130 lbs), which isn't directly a risk factor, but maybe it affects his stability or self-esteem? Maybe low weight here.\n\nNever married living alone points to possible instability. Medium risk as being single can be a risk factor for recidivism due to lack of support network.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college indicates he lacks education, which is a known risk factor. High weight on that.\n\nHeld 2 jobs during the year; having some employment might provide stability but also if unstable, could increase risk. Medium weight here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) and mood swings or low mood are concerning signs of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to further problems. High weight due to possible relapse.\n\nLived with both parents in a household of 9, which is quite large. Maybe more stress, but if they care for him well, it might not be as bad. Medium-low weight because size affects dynamics but could have some negatives.\n\nBelieves God influences his life; while that's personal, maybe indicates he seeks help, so medium to low risk here.\n\nPutting all factors together: Medium-high recidivism due to prior convictions and lack of education and employment stability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of 2 prior arrests with a conviction, indicating some criminal behavior in the past which can be a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old; while this age may influence development and decision-making, it does not directly correlate to rearrest rates without considering other factors like prior convictions and education levels.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation and stress, which may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking substance abuse treatment that could lead to further offenses.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, indicating potential lack of educational support and opportunities which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"The individual has held 2 jobs during the year; consistent employment can provide stability but may also indicate past issues that could affect future job prospects and substance use patterns.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"high\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years and experienced mood swings or low moods, which are signs of potential substance abuse issues that can lead to further behavioral problems or substance-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium-low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of 9 may indicate shared care but could also suggest living in an environment with potential stressors that might not directly contribute to recidivism risk without other factors like neglect or abuse.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"The individual believes God influences their life, which while personal, can be seen as a positive sign of seeking help and being committed to personal values, potentially reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
