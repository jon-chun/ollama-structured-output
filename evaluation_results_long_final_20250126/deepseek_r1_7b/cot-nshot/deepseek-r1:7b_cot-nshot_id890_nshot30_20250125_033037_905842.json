    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this prediction step by step. I need to determine the recidivism outcome for a 22-year-old White female based on her risk factors.\n\nFirst, her age is 22, which is relatively young but considering she's about to enter her late twenties, it's within a typical adult range. No immediate red flags there.\n\nShe has two arrests and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions increase the likelihood of rearrest. I'll rate this as high risk since each prior offense can be seen as a past failure contributing to recidivism.\n\nHer weight is between 150-174 lbs, which might suggest she\u2019s underweight or in a certain BMI range. However, without information on her lifestyle or health conditions, it's hard to assess if this directly affects her risk. So maybe medium impact here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which aligns with one of her risk factors about feeling down. This could contribute to substance use and decreased mental health, so that's a high-risk factor.\n\nShe has an associate/junior college degree but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a key factor; not completing or reengaging with education can increase recidivism risk, especially if she might seek help now. So medium impact here.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Job stability is generally positive for recidivism, so this would be low risk as having multiple income sources usually helps avoid financial and social dependency issues.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, especially since she's currently struggling with mood swings and low spirits. High risk here because ongoing substance use can impair judgment and lead to further complications.\n\nShe felt very down during the past month; this indicates poor mental health or emotional distress, which are strong indicators of high recidivism risk. Her belief in God might mitigate some stress but doesn't negate the severity of her current emotional state.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area could have its own set of issues, such as family dynamics or social environment challenges, contributing to higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), substance use (high), and emotional distress (high) are the dominant factors. While education is medium and employment is low, they don't fully offset the high risks from her past behavior and current mental health struggles. Therefore, I predict a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as prior offenses contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"weight_category\", \"medium\", \"Her weight is between 150-174 lbs.
