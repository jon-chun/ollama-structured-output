    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 20 years old, with 8 arrests and convictions. That's a high number of prior offenses, which definitely increases the risk. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nHe weighs between 150-174 lbs, which is on the lower end but still relevant. Since he's Black, maybe there are some disparities in the system, so this could be medium or high depending on other factors.\n\nNever married and living alone adds to the risk of substance abuse and isolation, which can lead to more criminal behavior. So that's another high factor.\n\nHaving a GED instead of a diploma might indicate less education, which is associated with higher recidivism rates. That's also a high weight.\n\nNot enrolled in college reinforces the idea that he's not seeking help or further education, so high risk here too.\n\nHe's never held any jobs during the year, meaning he has no income support and may rely on other factors like drugs for survival, which is another high risk factor.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't necessarily a direct cause but can contribute to underlying issues leading to crime, so medium weight here since it's one of several factors.\n\nNot feeling depressed could be due to various reasons, but if he's using drugs, that might indicate other stressors or mental health issues. Not sure about the weight on this; maybe low since it's not directly related.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Urban living can have its own set of challenges like higher crime rates or social issues, so medium risk here.\n\nConsidering that God has no role, which might mean he doesn't seek religious guidance for substance use or other issues, increasing the risk. Medium weight since it's one aspect but not directly tied to recidivism factors unless there are underlying mental health issues.\n\nPutting this all together: high prior offenses, low education, living alone, drug use, and no job\u2014all point towards a high likelihood of rearrest. So my prediction is \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 8 times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight Range\", \"medium\", \"Living in the lower weight category (150-174 lbs) may correlate with certain health issues or substance abuse, which could influence rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"high\", \"Never married and living alone increase the risk of isolation and potential substance abuse, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a GED instead of a diploma may indicate limited access to educational resources or support, potentially contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year suggests lack of income and stability, which can be precursors to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years may indicate substance abuse issues that could contribute to rearrest, though not exclusively linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation with Biological Mother\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household of size 3 may present unique challenges related to social or economic factors that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation and Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Not associating with God and not feeling depressed may suggest different coping mechanisms for stressors, which might affect recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
