    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female from a Black background. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Her weight and height don't immediately stand out as problematic, so maybe low risk there.\n\nShe's never married and living alone\u2014nothing unusual here; probably low to medium risk since she's single, but I'm not sure if that directly affects recidivism rates.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence job opportunities and re-arrest chances, so maybe low or medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nHolding no jobs during the year could be concerning because stable employment often helps prevent recidivism. This might tip it towards higher risk.\n\nHer drug use is only marijuana from the past four years\u2014minor substance abuse, which isn't severe but can still contribute to issues. Combined with her emotional state where she's feeling down a lot, this could increase risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a rural household of six seems like a stable environment, so maybe low risk there. However, family dynamics and living conditions can sometimes be linked to higher risk factors if there are issues within the household.\n\nShe considers God as having no influence on her personal matters\u2014this might indicate some level of alienation or lack of support system, which could affect her mental health and stability, increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several low-risk factors but some concerning ones. The jobless status is a big red flag. Considering the other examples provided, similar cases with high drug use, unemployment, and living alone often had higher rearrest rates. So I'd lean towards a medium to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, which is minimal compared to other factors like drug use or unemployment.\"),\n    (\"unemployed\", \"medium\", \"She has held no jobs during the year, which can increase rearrest risk as job instability often correlates with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"low\", \"She only used marijuana in the past four years, which is less severe than other examples but still contributes to potential issues.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"She felt down during the past month, indicating possible emotional distress that could affect behavior and stability.\"),\n    (\"family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of six suggests some level of stability despite being rural.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"high\", \"Her belief that God has no role in her personal matters indicates potential lack of support system, which can impact mental health and behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
