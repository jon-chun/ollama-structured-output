    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 5 times and convicted\u2014 that's a high number of prior offenses. From the examples given, higher arrest counts tend to correlate with higher recidivism rates because of past criminal behavior. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 165 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight isn't directly mentioned as a factor here, but his height might indicate something about his lifestyle or health, though that's not listed. Since it's not provided with recidivistic info, I'll note this as low.\n\nNever been married and not living alone\u2014 he's likely in a domestic setting or maybe single-parenting. This could affect his stability, so I'm thinking medium risk here because it shows some social instability but without direct evidence of past issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014 educational attainment is a big factor. From the examples, people without education often have higher rearrest rates. So this is definitely a high risk factor since it contributes to lack of opportunities and skills.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having employment can help with financial stability and reduce recidivism. So lower risk here\u2014 probably medium because he has some work experience but maybe inconsistent.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years\u2014 drug use, especially marijuana, is linked to higher recidivism rates due to possible substance abuse issues or increased crime opportunities. This would be a high risk factor.\n\nNot felt depressed over the past month\u2014 absence of emotional distress can indicate better mental health, which might reduce risk. So this could be low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household size 4 in an urban area. Urban living sometimes correlates with higher crime rates and less stability, but it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there are specific examples from the data. Since it's an urban setting without more info, I'll assign medium risk here because of potential social factors.\n\nConsiders God as a positive influence\u2014 this is actually protective. Support from religion can aid in personal growth and reduce criminal tendencies. So this should be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), no education (high), drug use (high) are the strongest factors pushing towards a YES outcome. Despite some medium factors like employment, the high risks likely dominate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple prior arrests and convictions which indicate past criminal behavior and instability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates potential lack of opportunities for positive development leading to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can contribute to substance abuse issues which may increase risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Employment history shows some stability but without consistent or high-quality employment which could affect future reliability.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"low\", \"Not living alone with a never-married status indicates potential domestic or single-parent issues that may influence social stability, though not directly tied to recidivism in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"depression_current\", \"medium\", \"No depression over the past month suggests better mental health which could positively impact recidivism risk despite other factors.\"),\n    (\"household_size_living_with_mother\", \"medium\", \"Living with a mother in a household of 4 may indicate certain social or environmental factors but without direct evidence of increased risk from examples provided, it's considered medium risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
