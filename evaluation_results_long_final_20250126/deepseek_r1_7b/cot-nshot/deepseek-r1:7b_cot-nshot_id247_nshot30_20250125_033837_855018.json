    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male, White, arrested twice and convicted. His weight is 275 lbs, which is quite heavy. He's married living with his spouse, has a high school diploma but isn't in college, and has held two jobs. Drug use includes marijuana and cocaine, which are significant factors. At age 20, he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. He believes in God affecting his personal outcomes.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided:\n\nExample 1: A 35-year-old male with multiple arrest records, similar weight, married living with spouse, GED, held jobs, used marijuana and cocaine, lived with parents in a large household of six, considered God's influence. Predicted NO.\nExample 2: Similar to this case but no drug use; predicted YES.\n\nComparing these examples, the key factors are the number of prior arrests, weight (overweight), living situation with both parents, and drug use.\n\nIn our case:\n- Prior arrests and convictions: High risk because multiple offenses can lead to more supervision or harsher sentences.\n- Weight: Over 200 lbs is a risk factor as it's associated with higher recidivism rates.\n- Married in a household of five: This might indicate support, but if there are issues, could be mitigating. However, the example didn't consider this, so perhaps not directly relevant here.\n- Drug use: High risk because drug abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and instability.\n- Belief in God: While some studies suggest belief can reduce recidivism through religious accountability, others don't find a significant effect.\n\nConsidering these points, prior arrests are the most significant factor. Each arrest increases the chances of reoffending. His living with both parents might offer support but doesn't directly correlate to lower rearrest rates as seen in other examples where similar factors didn't predict a NO outcome consistently.\n\nDrug use is another critical point; even if he believes in God, drug-related issues can still contribute to recidivism through unstable situations or substance misuse leading to further crimes.\n\nSo combining all these, his high prior arrests and drug use would lean towards a higher risk. However, considering his marriage and stable living situation with spouse might somewhat mitigate the risk compared to someone without such support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as each arrest often leads to increased supervision or harsher sentences.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"high\", \"His weight is over 200 lbs, which is a known risk factor for recidivism due to potential health issues and instability.\"),\n    (\"living_with_spouse\", \"medium\", \"Living with his spouse may provide emotional support but does not directly correlate to lower rearrest rates compared to other factors like prior arrests or drug use.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which are strong indicators of substance abuse linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"religion_influence\", \"low\", \"While he believes God influences his outcomes, this factor does not strongly correlate with reduced rearrest rates as seen in other examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
