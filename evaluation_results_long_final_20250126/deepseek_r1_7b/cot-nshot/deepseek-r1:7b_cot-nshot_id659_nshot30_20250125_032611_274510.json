    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. She has a lot of risk factors here.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 9 times and convicted, which is really high. That probably means she's more likely to reoffend because she's already had multiple chances to change her ways.\n\nShe weighs only 105 lbs, which might indicate she's in poor health or maybe struggling with substance abuse since she's used marijuana before. Being underweight could be a sign of neglect or lack of support.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone, so that might mean she has family issues or is experiencing domestic violence, both of which are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHer educational background: high school diploma but not in college. Maybe she's not getting the help she needs or is struggling to stay employed, leading her back into criminal behavior.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, so maybe she was laid off or couldn't find another job quickly enough. That could leave her with unstable income and motivation to recidivate.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years suggests she might be experimenting with drugs, which can have negative consequences on her life and mental health, increasing her chances of reoffending.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed recently, but that's a bit confusing because using marijuana can sometimes lead to mood changes. Maybe she's managing without it now, but she still has substance use issues.\n\nAt 21 years old, she's relatively young, which is actually a protective factor, but considering all the other high-risk factors here, her age might not be enough to offset everything else.\n\n living with her biological mother in a household of five could mean she's experiencing family neglect or abuse, both of which are serious indicators of recidivism.\n\nShe believes that God has nothing to do with her personal issues, which might contribute to her self-perception and behavior. If she doesn't see a higher power as a guiding force, it might mean she lacks the same level of accountability for her actions.\n\nPutting all these factors together, it's clear she has multiple red flags. High number of arrests, poor health, living situation issues, limited job opportunities, substance use, and personal beliefs that don't support positive behavior. All these point towards a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 9 times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior which increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"low_weight\", \"medium\", \"Her weight of 105 lbs may indicate poor health or substance abuse, which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living Situation\", \"high\", \"She is not living alone and has never been married, suggesting potential family issues or instability that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"educational Discontinuity\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, which may limit opportunities for support or positive influences.\"),\n    (\"limited_employment\", \"high\", \"She held only 1 job during the year, indicating possible economic instability or difficulty finding gainful employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which can contribute to substance abuse and potential negative mental health outcomes.\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, but this could be due to drug use or other factors affecting her mental state.\"),\n    (\"young_age_with_high_risk\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, while this is a protective factor, the combination of other high-risk factors may still predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family living Arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 5 could indicate neglect or abuse, which are serious indicators of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no_god_connection\", \"medium\", \"Her belief that God has nothing to do with her life may contribute to her lack of accountability and support for positive behavior changes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
