    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. Let's start by looking at all the risk factors mentioned in the case.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 22 years old, arrested once and convicted. His weight is within the specified range, so that's probably not an issue. He's never married and living alone, which might suggest some instability, but I'm not sure how much that directly affects rearrest.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college, so educational attainment could be a factor if GEDs are seen as barriers to better opportunities. However, he held no jobs during the year, which is a red flag because having employment can reduce recidivism by providing stability or income sources.\n\nDrug use history\u2014only marijuana\u2014which might not be severe but can still impact substance abuse treatment and job prospects. He's never felt depressed in the past month, so mental health isn't an immediate concern here.\n\nHis living situation was with adults other than his biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. This could indicate some family issues or instability from childhood, which might influence recidivism risk. However, it's not as direct as having multiple prior offenses or specific substance abuse.\n\nConsidering the examples provided earlier, factors like previous convictions, age (though 22 is relatively young), education level, employment status, and living arrangements all play roles in predicting rearrest. In this case, since he has a GED but no college degree, that might slightly increase risk compared to someone with higher education.\n\nHe's never been in foster care or adopted, so family stability isn't an issue here. His jobless status is a significant factor because not working can lead to financial instability and increased chances of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nPutting it all together, the lack of employment, prior arrest, and living situation might contribute to higher recidivism risk. I think he's more likely to have rearrest compared to someone with better job prospects or fewer past issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 22 years old, which may indicate a shorter time in the workforce and potentially higher recidivism risk due to youth factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest can influence recidivism risk as it's associated with increased criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No job held during the year is a significant factor, as unemployment often correlates with higher rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"A GED may present some barriers to better opportunities, but it doesn't directly correlate strongly with rearrest without additional factors like substance abuse or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could contribute to instability and potential stressors that might influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Only marijuana use in the past four years is noted; this alone doesn't strongly indicate higher recidivism risk without other factors like substance abuse or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"No indication of depression, which could mitigate recidivism risk if present.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of four isn't directly linked to increased rearrest unless there are underlying family issues not mentioned here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
