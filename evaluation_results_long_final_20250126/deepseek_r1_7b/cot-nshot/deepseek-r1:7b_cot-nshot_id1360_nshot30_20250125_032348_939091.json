    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the relative weight of each risk factor for this case and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples given, older individuals often have lower recidivism rates because they're more settled in life or have better job opportunities. So I think this would contribute a low weight.\n\nShe has two arrests but no convictions. Arrests without convictions are still significant; they can affect employment and housing, so that might be a medium weight.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 7 inches. In the examples, there's not much variation in height, but taller individuals aren't necessarily a risk factor here. So I'd say this contributes low weight.\n\nNever married: Marital status isn't directly tied to recidivism unless it's a lack of support network, which might be a medium effect since living alone can isolate her more.\n\nLiving alone: This is a strong indicator of potential issues like substance abuse or lack of support. So high weight here.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college: Lack of education can lead to unstable situations, so that's probably a medium-high risk factor. Maybe high because getting a GED can help with employment.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year: Employment instability is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can strain family support networks. High weight here too.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years: Drug use, especially marijuana, can lead to strained relationships or substance abuse issues, so medium-high risk.\n\nNo depression felt in the past month: Not feeling depressed might be a positive sign, but since she has other negative factors, it might not outweigh them. Maybe low weight here.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2: Co-residing with an unmarried couple could mean less support or more stress, so medium-high risk factor.\n\nBelieves in God: This is subjective. Some people's religion can provide support and help avoid substance abuse but might not directly influence rearrest rates as strongly as other factors. Maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the major factors are her lack of education, living alone without a support network, drug use, and past arrests. These seem to push her towards a higher risk. I'm leaning towards a YES prediction with high confidence because multiple strong risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 22 suggests she is relatively settled in life, which may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to younger individuals who might be more impulsive or in transition.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions can impact her employment and housing stability, increasing the likelihood of rearrest but not exclusively.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"No significant impact as height does not directly correlate with recidivism rates based on provided data.\"),\n    (\"Never Married\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network may increase stress or isolation risks associated with substance use and other issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living in solitude can lead to higher stress levels, strained relationships, and increased likelihood of substance abuse, all of which are risk factors for rearrest.\"),\n    (\"No Diploma/GED, Not Enrolled in College\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with unstable family situations or limited opportunities, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Held No Jobs During the Year\", \"high\", \"Joblessness can strain family support systems and increase stress levels, directly contributing to rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Used Drugs (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is linked to potential strained relationships or substance abuse issues that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed might indicate a more stable mental state, which could slightly reduce recidivism risk despite other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Lived with Biological Mother in Household of Size 2\", \"medium-high\", \"Living with an unmarried couple may lack the necessary support or stability to prevent substance abuse or other issues that contribute to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Believes in God\", \"low\", \"Religious belief can provide support but does not directly mitigate recidivism risk as other factors are significant contributors in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
