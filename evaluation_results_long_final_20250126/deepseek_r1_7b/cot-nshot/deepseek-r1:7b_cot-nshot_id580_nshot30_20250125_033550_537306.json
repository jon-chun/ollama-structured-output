    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors for this case step by step. Let's start with each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White male, arrested once and convicted. That's a clear recidivism indicator; more time since release could mean lower chances of reoffending soon.\n\nHe weighs 120 lbs at 5'2\". That's underweight but maybe due to being a student. Not sure how that affects risk, maybe academic stability is better.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014sounds like he might be in a stable living situation, which could reduce stressors leading to recidivism.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism as it can provide skills and opportunities for positive change.\n\nHe held only one job last year and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed. No recent criminal history and stable employment might indicate better job performance and higher chances of successful reintegration.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of 5, urban area\u2014though the size is moderate, living with family can provide support, which could help avoid further issues.\n\nDoesn't believe in God\u2014might lead to lower self-reliance on religious factors for emotional or societal support, which could be linked to higher recidivism risk if he lacks such networks.\n\nPutting it all together: No high-risk factors but several moderate ones. His education and stable living situation suggest a low to medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"The individual has a recent conviction, which typically indicates past criminal behavior that could be a risk factor for recidivism. However, the time since conviction might indicate lower immediate risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight Status\", \"low\", \"At 120 lbs with a height of 5'2'', the individual's weight may be below average.

This could indicate potential job instability if more experience is needed for reemployment, which might increase risk over time but may also suggest focus on improving future employment efforts.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use or depression symptoms are noted, indicating a stable mental health status which can reduce recidivism risk as individuals with better mental health often have higher chances of avoiding criminal behavior after release.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Age of Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of 5 suggests some level of family support and care. However, the size is moderate and might not necessarily indicate high risk but could also lack the stability that comes with living with extended family who may provide additional support or influence.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Does not believe in God and considers this belief irrelevant to personal decisions or societal issues potentially affecting recidivism.
