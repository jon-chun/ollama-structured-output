    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to predict whether a 19-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years based on his risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has one prior arrest and it wasConvicted. That seems significant because prior convictions are usually associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor unless there's something about his health, but in this case, it doesn't stand out as problematic for recidivism. Maybe medium?\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to higher stress or issues with social support, which might contribute to substance use or other problems. So maybe high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. While education is usually positive, being currently in school could indicate stability, so perhaps medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple stable jobs is generally good for recidivism, so that might be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and felt down recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause of arrest but can lead to other issues like theft or substance abuse problems, which could increase rearrest chances. So maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with both parents at age 6 in a household size of 3. That's a stable environment, so probably low risk for this factor.\n\nConsidering his religion (God involved), that might provide some positive influence but isn't directly related to recidivism stats, so perhaps medium or low?\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest is high, living alone and drug use are medium, others are lower. So overall, the risk seems higher than not being a factor like being in college.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_convicted\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest that wasConvicted, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_weight\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old with a weight of 165 lbs, there's no immediate health risk factor evident in this case that directly impacts recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to increased stress and social isolation, which may contribute to substance use issues or other behavioral problems that could increase rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_college\", \"medium\", \"While he has a high school diploma, being enrolled in college indicates some level of educational stability and support, which is protective against recidivism but not definitive in all cases.\"),\n    (\"jobs_held\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs suggests stable income and employment history, which generally correlates with lower rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_and_mood\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) and mood swings may indicate potential for substance abuse issues or emotional instability that could influence behavior and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size_and_stability\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of 3 indicates a stable upbringing, which is protective against many forms of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion_and_mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Religious involvement can sometimes correlate with positive mental health outcomes but does not directly mitigate criminal behavior or rearrest risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
