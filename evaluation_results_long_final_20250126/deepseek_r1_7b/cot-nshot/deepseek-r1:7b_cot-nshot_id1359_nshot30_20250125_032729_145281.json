    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested twice and convicted. That's two prior convictions, which is significant because more past convictions generally increase the likelihood of rearrest. From the examples given, people with multiple arrests tend to have higher recidivism rates, so this could be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 175-199 lbs. That's a healthy weight for his height, which means he might not face issues related to being underweight or obesity. So maybe the physical health aspect isn't a major concern here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can contribute to isolation, which sometimes leads to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. This could be a medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it might not be as severe as having family issues or previous substance use.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now. Being in education might indicate higher self-esteem and better life skills, which usually reduces the chance of recidivism. This should probably be a low to medium weight since academic focus could positively influence his behavior.\n\nHe's never held a job during the year. Not having work experience can limit opportunities for positive reinforcement and financial stability. This is definitely a high risk factor because unemployment often correlates with higher rates of criminal involvement or substance abuse.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years is mentioned, but not cocaine this time. Drug use, especially cannabis, can lead to health issues and legal problems. It's important to note that previous drug use (like in example 28) led to a YES outcome, so this could be a high risk factor if it's ongoing.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a setting might contribute to behavioral issues or substance abuse later on. This is another medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it might not be as severe as other factors like family violence or multiple prior crimes.\n\nConsidering God as a positive influence is mentioned, which could indicate a focus on personal values and maybe better decision-making. This can lower the risk, so this should probably have a low weight.\n\nPutting all these together: high (arrests), medium (age group), high (drug use), medium (unemployment), low (school enrollment), medium (family living situation), low (religion influence). \n\nThe most significant factors are the prior arrests and drug use, which both point towards a high risk of rearrest. The lack of school involvement might mitigate some risk, but the other factors like unemployment and family environment seem to increase it.\n\nSo overall, considering all these points, I'd lean towards a YES outcome with high confidence because multiple high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior arrests which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly marijuana, is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to health issues and legal problems.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone often correlates with isolation and risky behaviors such as substance abuse which may contribute but not exclusively.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school indicates a focus on education, which is typically positively correlated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Family Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five could indicate potential behavioral influences but does not directly correlate with higher rearrest rates compared to other factors like substance use or prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"low\", \"Considering God as something positive can lead to better decision-making and personal values that may reduce risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
