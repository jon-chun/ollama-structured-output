    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. He has one arrest but hasn't been convicted yet. His weight and height are within typical ranges, so that doesn't raise any red flags. He's never married and living alone, which might suggest some social or personal issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. That's actually a positive factor because education can lead to better job opportunities and lower chances of reoffending. But he hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could mean he's not actively seeking employment or maybe has struggled to find work.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana in the past four years. While this isn't as severe as harder drugs like cocaine or meth, it still can affect mental health and decision-making. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that might mitigate some of the risks associated with drug use.\n\nHousehold situation: At a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area\u2014size 4. That's a stable environment, so no major issues there. But living alone now could indicate some instability or stress.\n\nReligion: He believes in God, which might provide support and guidance but isn't directly linked to recidivism unless he actively uses it for substance abuse.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided:\n\n- More arrests (even if not convicted) can be a sign of problematic behavior.\n- Living alone with no jobs could mean he's relying on others or has poor skills that prevent him from finding stable employment.\n- Education is positive, but not working might indicate other issues like substance abuse or lack of motivation.\n\nConsidering the factors, I think this person has some risk indicators. The arrest, albeit not a conviction, and the lack of job experience could increase the risk. The fact that he's still in college might help, but not having any jobs during the year is concerning. Drug use isn't severe enough to directly cause reoffending, but it's something to monitor.\n\nPutting it all together, I would say there's a medium risk here. He has some factors that could lead to recidivism, but he also has positive aspects like education and living in a stable household.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time, not convicted)\", \"low\", \"Low because one arrest is noted, which might indicate prior issues, but it's not a conviction yet.\"),\n    (\"Employment (No jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk as no job experience could suggest instability or difficulty obtaining employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in past four years)\", \"low\", \"Low risk since marijuana is less severe than other drugs and he hasn't felt depressed recently.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone (Currently)\", \"low\", \"No direct risk, but living alone can sometimes indicate personal challenges.\"),\n    (\"Education (High school diploma, enrolled in college)\", \"high\", \"High because education can lead to better opportunities, so it's a positive factor. \"),\n    (\"Religion (Yes, something to do with him personally)\", \"low\", \"Low as religion might provide support but isn't directly linked to substance abuse here.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
