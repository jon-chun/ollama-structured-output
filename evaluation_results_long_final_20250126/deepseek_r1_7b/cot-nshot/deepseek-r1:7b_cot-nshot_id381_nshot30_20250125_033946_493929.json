    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor for the 19-year-old male and determine their relative weights\u2014low, medium, or high. Then, based on these weights, I'll predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors from the case:\n\n- Arrested once but not convicted.\n- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (which is slightly below average for adults).\n- Weight: 155 lbs (underweight compared to many people his age and height).\n- Never married, living alone.\n- High school diploma enrolled in a 4-year college.\n- Held 1 job during the year.\n- Used marijuana in the past four years.\n- Felt depressed or down for some of the past month.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor:\n\n1. **Arrested once but not convicted**: This is a minor offense with no prior conviction. Generally, this might indicate low risk, but it's still an arrest which could be a red flag.\n\n2. **Height (6 feet 1 inch)**: Being tall isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it relates to other issues like being in trouble or taller than necessary for jobs. Here, it doesn't seem directly related, so maybe low weight.\n\n3. **Weight (155 lbs)**: Being underweight can sometimes be linked to poor eating habits or health issues, which might contribute to substance use and depression. This could have a medium impact.\n\n4. **Never married, living alone**: Living in a single, possibly lonely environment with no support might increase stress and substance use, indicating medium risk.\n\n5. **High school diploma enrolled in college**: College enrollment usually means he's seeking further education, which is positive and lowers recidivism risk\u2014so low weight here.\n\n6. **Held 1 job during the year**: Employed at least one job can be beneficial as it provides income and stability\u2014low weight.\n\n7. **Used marijuana (past four years)**: Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism\u2014it increases chances of engaging in similar behavior again\u2014high weight.\n\n8. **Felt depressed or down**: Emotional distress can lead to substance abuse and impulsive behaviors that might contribute to criminal behavior\u2014high weight.\n\nNow, considering each factor's weight:\n\n- Low: Heights, college enrollment, job.\n- Medium: Arrest once, weight issues, living alone.\n- High: Drug use and depression.\n\nLooking at the case, he has a recent arrest but no conviction. He's underweight, which might be related to drug use or other health issues. He lives alone with no support, which can exacerbate mental health issues. His ongoing depression and marijuana use are strong indicators of potential recidivism.\n\nConsidering the high weight factors (marijuana use and depression) combined with living situation and prior arrest, he's at higher risk despite positive factors like education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested once but not convicted\", \"low\", \"Low because it is a minor offense without prior conviction.\"),\n    (\"Height (6 feet 1 inch)\", \"low\", \"No direct relation to recidivism risk; above average height doesn't indicate any specific risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Weight (155 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"Underweight could relate to poor health or substance use, which might contribute to depression and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Never married, living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living in a single environment can increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse and depression.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"College enrollment is positive as it indicates pursuit of further education which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment provides stability and income, reducing risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Used marijuana (past four years)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to similar behavior issues.\"),\n    (\"Felt depressed or down (some time past month)\", \"high\", \"Emotional distress linked to substance abuse and impulsive behaviors that may contribute to criminal activity.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
