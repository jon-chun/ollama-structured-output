    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which is quite young, but she's making her own choices now. She's Black, which might be a factor considering some disparities in the justice system.\n\nShe has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. That means she didn't face any consequences for her crime, so maybe she's not taking it seriously. Her weight is 120 lbs, which is below average\u2014could indicate she's in a situation where she might not have much to lose if she re-offs.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which could mean she doesn't have support systems helping her stay out of trouble. She has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe she's looking for more education or career opportunities, but it's unclear how that affects recidivism.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year\u2014maybe she's stable enough to avoid getting into trouble again, but sometimes having multiple jobs can also mean she's juggling responsibilities and might struggle with decision-making.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. It shows she's been making better choices recently. However, her feelings of low mood for part of the month could indicate underlying issues like stress or mental health problems, which might not be addressed.\n\nShe lived with her biological dad in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more stressors, which might contribute to recidivism if she's exposed to negative influences.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one non-convicted arrest (low), young age (low), below-average weight (low), no education beyond high school (medium), living alone with a supportive family background (low), two jobs (low), no drug use but emotional distress (medium), and living in an urban household (low). \n\nPutting it all together, her support system isn't strong enough to prevent rearrest. The lack of significant past criminal history might be a mitigating factor, but the other factors point towards potential issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 20 years old, which may indicate she is making her own decisions and not in a situation where she has much to lose if she re-offs.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black could potentially be associated with systemic issues that might impact her recidivism risk but isn't directly indicative of high or low risk on its own\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"She weighs 120 lbs, which is below average and may indicate she is in a situation where she might not have much to lose if she re-offs.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college.
