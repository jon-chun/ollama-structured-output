    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, most people with a single arrest and no conviction had different outcomes. Some went YES, others NO. So that alone isn't enough to predict, but it's something to note.\n\nHe weighs over 250 lbs. In the given examples, someone weighing more than 250 was considered high risk in some cases. For example, in Example 3, a similar weight led to a YES outcome. But I should see if this is consistent across other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. In several examples, being single was associated with higher recidivism, especially when not convicted after an arrest (like Examples 10 and 27). So that might be a medium-high risk factor.\n\nEnrolled in school: This one is interesting because most examples either didn't mention it or had no effect. For instance, Example 4 showed someone in school with no prior arrests but ended up NO, while Example 8 had similar factors leading to YES. It's not very consistent, so maybe low impact here.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. More stable income might reduce recidivism, as seen in some examples where job stability was a factor (like Examples 5 and 10). So this could be a medium risk factor, indicating lower chance of reoffending.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana but not cocaine or other substances. In Examples like 6 and 9, prior drug use withoutconviction had mixed results, sometimes leading to YES. Since he only used marijuana, maybe it's less severe than others, so perhaps low risk here.\n\nLiving with both parents in an urban area at a young age could indicate a stable home environment, which is usually protective against recidivism. In Examples 15 and 26, similar factors led to NO outcomes. So this might be a protective factor, reducing the risk.\n\nConsidering God as a factor: He believes in it positively. This is more of a protective factor compared to others like drug use or living situation. In some cases, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism (like Examples 3 and 15), so maybe this adds a bit of positive weight but not too high.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest count isn't a big risk since he wasn't convicted. His weight is on the higher side, which might be a slight concern. Being single and living alone, along with drug use, could increase risk. However, being enrolled in school and living with both parents are protective factors that might lower the overall risk.\n\nSo weighing each factor: Weight - high; Single/Living Alone - medium; School enrollment - low; Drug Use - low; Religiosity - low. The high weight from his weight may pull the outcome towards YES, but other factors like being single and living with parents could balance it out to a NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest count (1 time not convicted)\", \"low\", \"His arrest count is 1 without conviction.
