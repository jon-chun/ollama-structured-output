    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female with mixed race. She's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That might be a low to medium risk because she's younger and hasn't completed any prior convictions.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. Her weight seems below average, which could indicate lower fitness levels for substance abuse recovery, possibly making her a higher risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone, which might suggest she's focused on herself or has fewer social support networks that could help if she relapses.\n\nEnrolled in school at the present moment. Education can be a positive factor; having ongoing education might indicate better life choices, but it also depends on how engaged she is with her studies.\n\nShe held 2 jobs during the year. Having employment is generally good for recidivism because it provides stability and income. But since she's only got one conviction pending, maybe her job situation isn't directly related to substance abuse issues.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, can be a significant risk factor for relapse. It shows ongoing substance abuse which could lead to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nShe felt down during the past month; some of the time it was so bad that nothing could cheer her up. Emotional distress is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues and possible relapse.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 6. Larger households might offer more support but can also mean less supervision if not properly managed, which isn't directly tied to rearrest but could influence behavior patterns.\n\nShe considers God as something that affects her personal life. This religious involvement can sometimes be protective, but it's subjective and doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a low to medium risk because she's younger, has some substance use history, is emotionally distressed, and is living alone without a significant support system. However, her employment might help mitigate some of these risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"She is 18 years old, which is relatively young, indicating she may be in the early stages of substance use recovery and has fewer life experiences that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but has not been convicted.
