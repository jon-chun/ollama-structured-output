    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the risk factors for this 22-year-old female based on the provided examples. Let's break down each factor.\n\nHer age is 22, which isn't a direct risk factor but is within the typical recidivism window. She has one arrest but no conviction\u2014arrests without convictions can be significant because they indicate potential for reoffending if not addressed.\n\nShe weighs between 150-174 lbs, which is underweight for her height, possibly indicating malnutrition or other health issues that might increase risk.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone, which could imply instability\u2014lack of support can lead to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school without further education can sometimes predict lower recidivism if education is seen as a positive predictor, but it might also indicate limited opportunities leading to other issues.\n\nHolding four jobs shows solid employment history, which is usually favorable for reducing rearrest risk.\n\nNo drug use is positive, indicating better substance health. However, feeling down could suggest mental health issues, which isn't addressed here.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of three suggests some family support but also potential challenges related to living arrangements.\n\nConsidering God's involvement might indicate personal stability or religious coping mechanisms, which can sometimes be protective.\n\nLooking at the examples, most factors that contributed to 'YES' outcomes included higher arrests, more jobs (in example 8), and no religion involvement. Conversely, lower arrest counts, fewer jobs, and negative feelings often led to 'NO'.\n\nPutting it all together, her low number of arrests without convictions might be a mitigating factor if other risk factors are controlled. The employment history is strong, which is a positive sign. However, the negative mood could hint at underlying issues that aren't addressed here.\n\nI'll assign medium weight to each factor since they're mixed but leaning towards lower risk due to employment and arrest status.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 22, which falls within the typical recidivism window for individuals under 30.
