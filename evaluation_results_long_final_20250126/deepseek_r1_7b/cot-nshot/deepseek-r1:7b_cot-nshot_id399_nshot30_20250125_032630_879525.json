    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest but hasn't been convicted. That's a medium risk because even though it's not a full conviction, having an arrest can indicate past behavior that might lead to future issues.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height, which could be a sign of health issues or living in poverty. Underweight individuals sometimes have access to fewer resources, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates\u2014so that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which might make him more susceptible to negative emotions and substance use\u2014another medium risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a key predictor of recidivism; not having a diploma puts him at higher risk compared to those with education. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to strained relationships, substance abuse issues, and impulsive behavior\u2014all factors that increase recidivism. However, since he isn't showing recent depression, this might slightly reduce the risk\u2014so maybe a medium or low.\n\nHe's lived with his household for five years. The size of the household could affect stability; larger households sometimes have more resources but can also lead to dependency issues if not properly managed. With a household size of five, it's a bit on the lower side, so I'd say this is a low risk factor.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks it affects his personal situation positively. This could be a mitigating factor as religious beliefs might provide some support or structure, reducing recidivism risk\u2014so that would be low to medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium to high risks from the arrest history, lack of education, living alone, drug use, but mitigated by smaller household size and belief in God. The overall risk seems moderately high since several factors point towards higher risk despite some protective ones.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor, here is the weighted breakdown:\n\n- Medium: Arrest history (1 time), small household size (5 people)\n- High: Lack of education, living alone\n- Medium: Drug use in past four years\n- Low to Medium: Belief in God and recent mental health\n\nGiven these factors, the individual appears to have a moderately high risk for rearrest. The primary contributors are his arrest history, lack of education, and living situation, while other factors like drug use and religious belief somewhat mitigate the risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Has one arrest but not convicted which can indicate past behavior that may lead to future issues.\"),\n    (\"underweight\", \"medium\", \"Weight of 5'7\\\"/125-149 lbs suggests possible health issues or living in poverty, both associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation and may contribute to negative emotions and substance use which are linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED is a significant predictor of higher recidivism risk compared to those with education.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years can lead to strained relationships, substance abuse issues, and impulsive behavior which are linked to recidivism.
