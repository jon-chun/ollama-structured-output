    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this case. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 22 years old, arrested 6 times but not convicted. His weight is 140 lbs, which seems low. He's never married and living alone\u2014so that's isolation. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a significant educational disadvantage.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, so no work experience to speak of. That's another risk factor because lack of gain can increase recidivism. He uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine consistently, which is a major problem. Plus, he feels very down every month, indicating mental health issues or extreme stress.\n\nHe lived in a household of 4 at a young age\u2014so maybe some neglect or not enough supervision? But since he's an adult now living alone, that might be less relevant unless there are other factors.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life. That could be a positive motivator but also could mean he's relying on something else for his well-being which might affect his ability to face challenges.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases with multiple drug use, lack of education, living alone without any work experience, and strong emotional distress have varied outcomes. Some had high recidivism rates (like YES in some cases), others NO.\n\nGiven all these factors\u2014arrest history, lack of education, isolation, drug use, emotional distress\u2014the risk is quite high. So I'd assign each factor a weight based on their impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 6 times without any convictions, indicating a history of criminal behavior which strongly correlates with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that can lead to further arrests.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 22 years old, despite being an adult, may indicate a lack of support system which could contribute to higher recidivism risk but is less directly impactful than other factors like drug use and emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"high\", \"No job held during the past year suggests a lack of economic stability or purpose, both of which are known predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Consistent use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years is strongly linked to higher rates of criminal behavior and substance abuse, all of which increase rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling extremely down every month for much of the time suggests chronic stress or mental health issues, both of which are known risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of size 4 before turning 22; however, since he's now an adult and living alone, this factor is less relevant compared to current circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"While believing in God may provide some motivation, it also indicates potential reliance on external factors which can hinder personal resilience against stressors and challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
