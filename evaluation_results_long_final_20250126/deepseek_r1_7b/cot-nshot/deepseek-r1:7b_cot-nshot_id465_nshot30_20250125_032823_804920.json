    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit new to recidivism prediction, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'6\" and weighs 130 lbs, which seems underweight for her height. She's never married and living alone with her college. She has a high school diploma and enrolled in college, so she's got some education. She's held two jobs recently without any drug use or depression in the past month.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor for this case. Let's list out the factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 is relatively young, but she has a high school diploma and college enrollment, which are positive signs.\n2. Arrests: Only one arrest, not convicted. If an arrest without conviction isn't a serious offense, maybe it's low risk.\n3. Weight: Underweight might indicate health issues or living in poverty, so could be medium.\n4. Marital status: Never married and living alone, which is usually associated with lower risk compared to being married or cohabiting.\n5. Education: High school diploma and attending college, which are protective factors against recidivism, so high weight.\n6. Employment: She's worked two jobs, which can provide financial stability and reduce recidivism risk, so medium.\n7. Drug use: No recent drug use, very low risk factor.\n8. Depression: No recent feelings of depression, again a good sign.\n9. Household: At home with people other than biological parents in an urban area. Urban households might have more resources or support, but having non-parents could be a bit concerning.\n\nComparing to the examples, someone with no convictions and low recidivism factors would lean towards \"NO\" for rearrest. She has several protective factors like education and employment, so maybe her risk is lower than some in the examples, especially those without college or multiple jobs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is relatively young, though she has completed high school and is enrolled in college, indicating positive educational factors that may mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction.

Her lack of this indicates lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with adults other than biological parents in an urban area.
