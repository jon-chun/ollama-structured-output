    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old Hispanic male. I'll start by going through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his arrest history: he's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with a single non-convicted arrest had outcomes like YES or NO depending on other factors. So this is probably low weight since it's just an arrest without conviction.\n\nNext, his weight and height: 5'9\" and 130 lbs. Looking at the examples, there's no clear association between body weight and rearrest, so maybe this factor doesn't contribute much\u2014low weight.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. In the examples, living with family was a mitigating factor in some cases, like being with parents or siblings. So maybe this is low to medium depending on how it affects his stability.\n\nHigh school diploma without college: Many examples have high school graduates who either did or didn't graduate college and had varying outcomes. Education level can be a risk factor if it's below what's expected, but here it's just a diploma\u2014probably low weight since it's standard.\n\nHe held one job during the year. In some cases, having a job was positive, especially if it provided stability, so maybe this is medium to high depending on the job itself and income.\n\nNo drug use in past four years: This is good news; not using drugs reduces risk. So low weight here.\n\nNo depression in the past month: Being depressed can increase recidivism, but he hasn't felt down recently\u2014this might be a mitigating factor\u2014so maybe medium to high.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates or stress levels, which could contribute to higher risk\u2014maybe high weight.\n\nBelieves in God: Some examples where religion was a factor had either positive or neutral outcomes depending on other factors. So probably low to medium.\n\nNow, putting it all together. He has one arrest, not convicted, which is low. No family living situation affecting him since he's with his mother but in an urban area\u2014maybe medium because the setting could be stressful. Education and job are positive, so maybe mitigates some risk. No drugs or depression, which are strong negatives.\n\nThe factors that might increase risk are the single arrest, urban environment, lack of college education? Wait, he has a diploma, so maybe not as high. The urban area with six people in the household could be a problem. He's never married and living alone\u2014wait, no, he is not living alone; he's with his mother but in an urban area.\n\nSo combining all these: the urban environment might push him into higher risk situations, even though other factors are mitigating. Maybe this case has a medium to high risk based on the environment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History (Non-Convicted)\", \"low\", \"This individual has one non-convicted arrest history, which is generally considered a low risk factor as it does not result in a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Body Weight/Height\", \"low\", \"There is no clear association between body weight and rearrest outcomes in the examples provided, so this factor is considered to have a low influence on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area may present challenges that could contribute to higher recidivism risk due to potential stress or social factors associated with urban environments.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is considered standard and does not inherently increase risk, so this factor has a low influence on the individual's recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year could provide some stability but may also have limitations depending on the nature of the job.
