    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Black female. Let's break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a single arrest but no conviction. That might be a medium concern because being arrested can indicate some level of prior negative behavior, even if it wasn't enough to get a conviction.\n\nShe weighs 190 lbs and is 5'6\". That's within the average range, so maybe height isn't an issue here. Her weight doesn't immediately jump out as problematic unless there's other info about health or substance use, which I don't see yet.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014maybe she has a partner? Or perhaps she's in a relationship but not legally married. That could affect her social support but might not directly influence recidivism much if she's stable.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism, so this is probably a high risk factor. Without education, she might face challenges that increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year\u2014she's employed but briefly. Employment alone doesn't guarantee stability unless it's full-time or consistently maintained. Short-term employment could be a medium risk because it shows some work history but maybe not enough for steady support.\n\nNo drug use in past four years, which is positive. Drug use can contribute to recidivism if there are underlying issues like addiction or substance abuse.\n\nShe felt down during the month\u2014this might relate to mental health. Persistent feelings of depression can be a risk factor as it may influence decision-making and willingness to engage in criminal activities again.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of size 2, urban area\u2014she has support from family, which is usually protective unless there's underlying family dysfunction or neglect that isn't mentioned here.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014this might indicate a strong moral compass, which can be protective against certain types of recidivism, especially violent crimes. However, it doesn't directly affect non-violent reoffending as much.\n\nPutting this together: High risk factors include lack of education and no college, past employments but briefly, single living situation, and feelings of low mood. These points are likely to push her towards a higher recidivism risk despite some protective factors like family support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has previous arrest (not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, which may indicate prior behavioral issues that could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Educational background (no diploma/GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can be a significant predictor of recidivism as it may limit opportunities and support systems necessary for reintegration into society without supervision.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (1 job during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job might suggest some level of work experience, but limited employment duration could indicate instability or lack of commitment which may increase risk over time.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (not living alone, never married)\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of 2 suggests she has family support, which is generally protective unless there are other negative factors not mentioned here.\"),\n    (\"Mental health indicators (feeling down during the past month)\", \"medium\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood can be linked to mental health issues that may influence decision-making and recidivism risk over time.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
