    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down the case step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White male who was arrested once but not convicted. That's an important factor because being arrested but not getting a conviction might mean he doesn't face immediate legal consequences beyond this dataset.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs and height is 5 feet 4 inches. The examples don't specify body weight as a key factor, so maybe that doesn't play a big role here.\n\nHe's married living with his spouse. Being in a relationship can sometimes indicate better support system, which might reduce recidivism risk because he has someone to rely on for emotional support and help if things get tough.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment history can be positive as it shows responsibility and ability to manage finances, which might help prevent future issues.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't had rearrest related to drug use based on the examples. However, he also mentions feeling down for some time, which might indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\n\nLiving with his spouse at age 22 indicates a stable home environment, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is on the lower side but not extremely low. The arrest isn'tConvicted, stable living situation, and education might help mitigate any issues. However, the mention of feeling down could hint at potential mental health issues that might come into play if things don't improve. So, weighing all these factors, I'd say his risk is medium.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the risk factors provided:\n\n- Being arrested once but not convicted (low): The person was arrested once but not convicted, which suggests minimal immediate legal consequences beyond this dataset.\n\n- Stable living situation with spouse (high): Living with a spouse indicates a stable home environment, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\n- Education level: High school diploma without college enrollment (medium): While education can reduce recidivism risk, the lack of college enrollment might indicate lower motivation or opportunities for further support.\n\n- Two job experiences (low to medium): Having held two jobs during the year suggests employability and responsibility, which are positive factors in reducing rearrest risk.\n\n- Drug use: Marijuana only (low): The history of marijuana use without other drug issues is mitigating compared to more severe substance abuse.\n\n- Emotional state: Some low mood (medium): This could indicate potential mental health challenges that might contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the overall risk is medium. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Was arrested once but not convicted\", \"low\", \"The person was arrested once but has not been convicted, which suggests minimal immediate legal consequences beyond this dataset.\"),\n    (\"Living with spouse at age 22\", \"high\", \"Stable living situation with a spouse indicates a protective environment which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma without college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"While education can reduce recidivism, the lack of college enrollment might indicate lower motivation or opportunities for further support.\"), \n    (\"Held two jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment history is generally positive as it shows responsibility and ability to manage finances, which might help prevent future issues.\"), \n    (\"Drug use: marijuana only in past four years\", \"low\", \"The history of marijuana use without other drug issues is mitigating compared to more severe substance abuse.\"), \n    (\"Emotional state: some low mood during past month\", \"medium\", \"This could indicate potential mental health challenges that might contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
