    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors from the provided case:\n\n- Age: 19 years (not sure how this impacts recidivism, but generally younger individuals might have lower reoffending rates if behavior is stable)\n- Arrests and Convictions: 1 time, convicted. (Medium risk; prior convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism)\n- Height: 5 feet 9 inches (weight isn't provided, but height alone doesn't directly indicate risk)\n- Weight: Between 225-249 lbs (BMI could be calculated, but no data given; perhaps within normal range? Not sure if weight is a factor here)\n- marital status: Never married. (Low to medium risk since lack of ties might reduce stress and strain leading to reoffending)\n- Currently living alone: Yes. (Medium risk; living alone can lead to increased stress or isolation, which may contribute to recidivism)\n- enrolled in school: Yes. (High risk because education can help with job opportunities and skills that prevent criminal behavior; conversely, maybe lack of support from school could be a problem if it's not leading positively)\n- Number of jobs held: 3 during the year. (Medium risk; holding multiple jobs might indicate higher stability or perhaps substance use affecting job performance)\n- Drug use: Past four years with marijuana and no cocaine. (Medium risk; even though he doesn't admit to feeling depressed, drug use can be a significant factor in recidivism if it leads to strained relationships or other issues)\n- Age at which lived with both parents: 4, in an urban area. (Low risk since proximity to supportive family could provide stability and emotional support)\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on these factors:\n\n1. **Arrests and Convictions**: Medium - Prior conviction indicates some risk but doesn't guarantee recidivism.\n2. **Marital Status**: Low - Never married might reduce stressors related to family issues.\n3. **Currently Living Alone**: Medium - Living alone can increase stress, which may lead to substance use or other issues that could reoffend.\n4. **Enrolled in School**: High - Education is a positive factor but could also be problematic if not leading to positive outcomes.\n5. **Drug Use**: Medium - Substance use is linked to recidivism and could impact future behavior.\n6. **Age at which lived with both parents**: Low - Family proximity reduces risk factors like isolation or neglect.\n\nPutting it all together, the high weight comes from education and prior convictions. Medium weights are from living alone and drug use. Low weights for age and marital status. Considering these, I think he's on the lower end but not negligible risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor and their weighted impact:\n\n- Prior Convictions: Medium\n- Living Alone: Medium\n- Drug Use: Medium\n- Education: High\n- Marital Status: Low\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a moderate to low likelihood of recidivism. However, due to potential underlying issues like drug use and living alone, the confidence is slightly higher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Prior convictions indicate some risk but do not guarantee recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress, leading to substance use or other issues that could reoffend.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is linked to recidivism and could impact future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in School\", \"high\", \"Education is a positive factor but could also be problematic if not leading to positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married might reduce stressors related to family issues, indicating lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
