    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is within a typical adult range, but it's important because younger individuals sometimes have different recidivism patterns. She has been arrested twice and convicted, so that's a significant positive risk factor because more arrests usually mean higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHer weight is 140 lbs, which is below the normal BMI range (around 165 lbs for her height), but I'm not sure if underweight is directly related to recidivism. However, maybe she's dealing with health issues that could contribute indirectly.\n\nShe is divorced and living alone, which might indicate some instability. Living in a single household can sometimes lead to higher stress or substance use issues. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, so educational barriers are present. This can hinder her ability to get better job opportunities or support.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which is concerning because unemployment often leads to substance abuse, lack of skills, and increased risk of recidivism. Not working for a year could mean she's not developing necessary life skills either.\n\nHer drug use history is clean\u2014no drugs in the past four years\u2014but her feelings of low mood or depression are significant. This might be related to substance abuse issues that aren't being addressed, which can contribute to recidivism if she starts using again.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. The size of the household could affect her support system; larger families sometimes have more resources but can also mean more dependency on others rather than self-sufficiency. Urban living might offer different opportunities or stressors that could influence her behavior.\n\nConsidering her belief in God, she sees spirituality as a positive factor. This might reduce recidivism if it provides guidance and stability, but if other factors are negative, this alone won't change the outcome.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some negatives like living situation, lack of education, unemployment, and mood issues, but also some positives like prior convictions and belief in God. The key factors here are her recent arrest history, educational barriers, living alone, and joblessness. These seem to lean towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 21 is within the typical adult range, which might influence recidivism patterns but doesn't directly indicate high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending as prior criminal history is a strong indicator of future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is below the normal BMI range, but this factor alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism without additional context about health issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after divorce may contribute to stress or substance use issues that can indirectly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates barriers to accessing better opportunities, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"high\", \"No job held during the year suggests potential dependency on welfare or substance abuse, both linked to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years may indicate a lower risk compared to others with drug issues but doesn't eliminate it entirely.\"),\n    (\"Mood and Depression Feelings\", \"medium\", \"Frequent feelings of low mood could be related to substance abuse or lack of engagement, which might contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment (Household Size)\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four doesn't inherently increase risk but may affect support systems and self-reliance.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God can provide some stability, but the presence of other negative factors might mitigate its protective effect.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
