    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the provided examples.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which isn't too concerning unless it's a minor, but since he's an adult, that's not a high risk factor. He has been arrested 3 times and convicted\u2014three convictions are significant because more convictions increase recidivism risk.\n\nHis weight is between 150-174 lbs. Being underweight or overweight can sometimes be linked to substance use issues, which he does have, so maybe that's a medium risk factor related to drug use.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and living alone\u2014living arrangements don\u2019t directly correlate with rearrest unless there are family dynamics, but since he's an only child or has no close ties, maybe this is low risk. But it could vary based on other factors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college\u2014which means he might not have the skills needed for better opportunities, increasing his risk of recidivism. This would be a medium to high weight factor.\n\nHeld 2 jobs during the year\u2014previous employment is positive unless it's low-paying or unstable. But having two jobs suggests some stability, so maybe this is a lower weight factor compared to others like prior convictions or substance use.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse strongly correlates with higher recidivism rates because of potential impulsive behaviors or street involvement. Since he's using both, that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe felt down most of the time during the month\u2014this could indicate depression or anxiety, which are mental health issues linked to recidivism. High weight here.\n\nLiving with adoptive parents in a household size of 3 in an urban area. While living with parents can provide support, if he's had issues before, it might not be as protective. Maybe medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has no role\u2014this could relate to his personal spirituality and might influence his behavior or willingness to seek help, which is a factor but perhaps lower weight compared to other clear behavioral indicators like substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), drug use (high), lack of education (medium), living situation (medium), emotional distress (high). The high factors are pulling towards a YES prediction. So I'd lean towards YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of previous convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions are a significant indicator of recidivism risk as they reflect past criminal behavior and legal issues which can impact future stability and willingness to comply with laws.
