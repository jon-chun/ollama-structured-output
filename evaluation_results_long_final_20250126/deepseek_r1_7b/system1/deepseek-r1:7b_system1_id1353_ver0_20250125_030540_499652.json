His height and weight don't seem directly relevant unless there's something about his health that could impact his ability or substance use.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone; maybe he has a family support system? The GED and lack of college enrollment could mean limited opportunities but also some independence, which might be both pros and cons. He's held three jobs, so work experience is positive, but it's only been a year, so maybe limited stability.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt down often recently. That suggests substance use issues and emotional distress, which are strong risk factors because they can impair judgment and relationships.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of three in a rural area might indicate family support but also possible isolation. Believing in God could be a coping mechanism or positive aspect, though it's hard to assess without more context.\n\nConsidering all these points\u2014past arrests, substance use, emotional distress\u2014the risk seems high because he has a history of mistakes and current issues that can lead to more problems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThe analysis indicates a high risk due to past criminal history, substance use, emotional distress, and other factors contributing to potential future difficulties.",
