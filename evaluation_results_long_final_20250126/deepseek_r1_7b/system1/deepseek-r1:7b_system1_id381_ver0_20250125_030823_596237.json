    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to act as a risk assessment expert and analyze these risk factors for someone who might be high risk. They provided specific criteria: only a JSON response with \"YES\" or \"NO\" and confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor one by one. The person is a 19-year-old male of White ethnicity. Not much info on that yet. He's been arrested once but not convicted\u2014arrests can indicate past behavior issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact isn't as severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and 155 lbs. That might be tall for his age, could affect how he stands in traffic or physical situations, but I don't know if that directly relates to risk.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other factors, it could increase risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college\u2014this is a positive trait; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe's held one job during the year\u2014not a lot of experience, but maybe part-time. Drug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana before, which can sometimes lead to related issues like anxiety or depression, affecting mental health and behavior.\n\nFeeling down for most of the past month\u2014this could indicate low mood, possibly depression or stress, which are risk factors on their own.\n\nAt a young age, lived with both parents in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might have had some protective effects but also potential challenges like limited support or exposure to negative influences.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014religion can be a protective factor against recidivism if it provides moral guidance and support.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest, drug use, feeling down, living with multiple relatives which could mean he's somewhat sheltered. His positive education and living alone might mitigate some risks but don't directly correlate to high risk unless combined with other negatives like recent substance abuse or unstable home environment.\n\nThe person has only one arrest and hasn't been convicted. The fact that he's a college student might suggest he's motivated to change his behavior. However, the downward mood could be indicative of deeper issues that need attention but doesn't necessarily make him high risk unless it's part of a pattern.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some negative factors like drug use and mood, the positive aspects like education and single status might balance them out. But the drug use is concerning\u2014it could be a sign of ongoing issues that could escalate if not addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
