    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm given a risk assessment scenario where I need to determine if certain factors indicate a high risk for someone. The person is a 21-year-old female Hispanic, arrested four times and convicted once. She's 5'4\" and weighs 180 lbs. She's single, living alone, has a high school diploma but isn't in college, worked three jobs this year.\n\nShe uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine, which is a red flag. Also, she mentions feeling down for much of the past month, which might indicate some underlying mental health issues or stressors affecting her. At a young age, she lived with six people, which could imply living in an environment that's not ideal, maybe neglectful or unstable.\n\nShe believes in God, so she's religious, but I'm not sure how that affects the risk assessment here. High school diploma isn't great for employment prospects, and being single and living alone can sometimes mean she might be looking for more stable relationships, which could be a negative factor if she's not focused on her current life.\n\nHer criminal history is four arrests with one conviction\u2014so maybe she has some underlying issues that led to her being in trouble. Using drugs is a significant risk factor as drug use often correlates with other risky behaviors or substance abuse problems, which can increase recidivism chances.\n\nShe\u2019s 21 years old, so perhaps in her prime working age but hasn't made it through college, maybe not seeking help for her issues. The fact that she's using drugs and has a history of living with many people could indicate some instability in her life, possibly leading to more negative outcomes like further substance abuse or delinquency.\n\nThe mention of feeling down much of the month points towards possible depression or stress, which can contribute to risky behaviors if not addressed. Her lack of marital status might mean she's seeking validation or support elsewhere, but that also could be a risk factor in itself.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest and conviction issues, drug use, living with many people at a young age, and feelings of low mood. These factors point towards high risk because each can contribute to negative outcomes like further substance abuse, unstable relationships, or increased likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
