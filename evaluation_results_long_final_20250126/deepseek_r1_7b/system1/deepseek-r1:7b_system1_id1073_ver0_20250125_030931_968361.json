    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male from Hispanic background. His age might not be directly indicative of risk unless there's a history associated with that age group. \n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of criminal behavior, which can lead to future involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs. While weight isn't typically a direct risk factor without comorbidities, it's more about overall health metrics like BMI or if he's morbidly obese.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can be related to stability; however, without other factors, it's not a strong indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nLack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; usually, higher education levels are associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can contribute to dependency issues, which might increase risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless it's chronic or severe.\n\nBiological mother living with him at a young age in an urban area. Early exposure could have various implications, including potential trauma factors that might influence behavior.\n\nBelief that God has nothing to do with his life: This indicates lack of religious affiliation, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk if it affects motivation towards positive behaviors or seeking help.\n\nPutting all these together, the key factors are prior convictions and lack of education. These are strong predictors of high risk in criminal justice reversion. The other factors don't provide enough evidence to contradict this assessment. Therefore, I conclude that there's a high risk with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
