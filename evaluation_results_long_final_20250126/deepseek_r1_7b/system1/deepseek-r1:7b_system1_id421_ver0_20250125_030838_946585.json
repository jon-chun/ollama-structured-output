    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. He has been arrested three times and convicted once. That seems like a significant number of convictions\u2014three would definitely raise some red flags.\n\nHe's described as tall, at 6 feet 0 inches, which isn't unusual, but his weight might be concerning if it's on the higher side for someone his age. His living situation is that he's living alone, which could be an indicator of instability or lack of support. He hasn't been married and is currently living alone\u2014maybe living with family now? That\u2019s a bit confusing.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma without college enrollment, so he might not have the skills needed for better opportunities. He has held two jobs in the past year; that's manageable but perhaps limited given his age.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive, but sometimes substance use can be a sign of deeper issues. His mood isn't great\u2014he feels down during some of the past month, so he's not feeling well mentally either.\n\nFamily history: He lived with both biological parents at a young age in a household of four in an urban area. That might suggest some exposure to family dynamics or environment that could impact his behavior later on. He doesn't believe in God, which is a personal choice but may indicate certain values or beliefs that could influence his risk-tending behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are major red flags. His current living situation alone isn't unusual for someone of his age with limited resources. The mood issues might be related to stress from his past experiences. However, considering the number of prior convictions, even if some factors are mitigating like not using drugs recently or living alone, the overall risk is still high.\n\nI think there's a significant risk here because of the multiple arrest and conviction history. While other factors like mood and family background might be contributing, the prior criminal history strongly suggests he could pose a risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
