    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female with two arrests but no convictions. That might suggest past Incivisibility, which could be a red flag, but since there are no convictions, it might not be as significant on its own.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and 160 lbs \u2013 that doesn't seem directly related to risk assessment unless there are health issues associated with her weight. But nothing in the factors mentions health problems, so I'll ignore this for now.\n\nShe's living alone, which could indicate higher isolation or social stressors. Her recent emotional state of feeling down most days might contribute to that. Emotional distress can sometimes be a sign of potential substance abuse or deeper mental health issues.\n\nShe has no family history of addiction or mental illness, but her upbringing was in a household of four with both parents present in a rural area at a young age. This could suggest she's experienced family dysfunction or trauma, which might increase risk factors like substance use or behavioral issues.\n\nHer religious beliefs don't seem directly related to her behavior unless they influence her mental health; however, since she doesn't see God as affecting her personally, that might indicate coping mechanisms without religious support, possibly leading to emotional instability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college \u2013 this suggests she's educated but doesn't have higher education. However, educational background alone isn't typically a strong risk factor unless it's related to substance abuse or lack of motivation.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year \u2013 part-time work can help with financial stability and provide structure, which might not be directly linked to high risk unless there are issues like job instability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. drug use, especially recent or frequent use, can indicate potential for substance abuse problems, which can lead to behavioral issues or increased risk of other crimes.\n\nHer recent emotional state feels like a sign of mental health issues. She's been feeling down most days in the past month, which could point towards depression or anxiety, both of which are serious mental health issues that require attention and might influence her behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: past Incivisibility (arrests), substance use (marijuana, cocaine), emotional distress, living alone, and potential family background. These elements collectively suggest a high risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
