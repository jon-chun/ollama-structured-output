    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me break down each factor and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but that's not always consistent across all contexts or data sets. So I'm cautious about relying solely on race here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That might suggest he is still facing consequences for his actions, which could indicate a potential for future criminal behavior. However, since he isn't convicted, maybe he's working on turning things around.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless there's an association with certain types of crimes or health issues, but I don't have enough information here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or other family-related issues. So this might actually lower the risk rather than increase it.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is important; people with higher education often have better job opportunities and less likely to engage in criminal activities compared to those without education. So this could be a protective factor, reducing risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple employment opportunities suggests he has some financial stability, which can help him avoid unstable situations that might lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can impair judgment and increase susceptibility to peer pressure or other negative influences. However, since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's managed his substance use well.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a large family could mean exposure to various stresses, including family dysfunction or social issues that might affect his behavior later on. Urban environments can sometimes have higher rates of crime and substance abuse, so this could be a risk factor.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief can provide a sense of control and purpose, which might help him stay on track rather than making impulsive decisions influenced by religion or spirituality.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest is a slight red flag, but since he hasn't been convicted, maybe he's proactive about changing his behavior. His living situation in the past could have had some negative influences, but he's now in an urban area where risk factors might be higher. Education and employment are positive indicators that reduce risk.\n\nI'm not sure how strong each factor is. The lack of conviction isn't enough to increase risk on its own. His living with his mother at a young age could have contributed to some issues, but he's now in a different environment. The belief in God might counterbalance any negative influences from past experiences.\n\nSo considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a lower risk assessment. Maybe not high risk, but there are still some warning signs that need monitoring.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
