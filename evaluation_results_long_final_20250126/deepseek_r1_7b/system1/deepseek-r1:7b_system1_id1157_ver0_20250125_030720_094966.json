    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female Hispanic. Her age and race might be significant in determining risk, but without more info on how these demographics affect her behavior or environment, I can't say much yet.\n\nShe has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. That's an important point because being arrested but not convicted might mean she's managed her situation well so far. However, it does indicate some past interaction with the legal system, which could be a risk factor if she's struggled before.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches. I'm not sure how relevant that is unless there are specific behaviors associated with that height, but generally, height alone doesn't predict risk behavior.\n\nShe's living alone, never married, and has no children. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation or stress, which might contribute to risky behaviors like drug use or emotional issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not completing higher education might leave her with fewer options, increasing the chance she could engage in risky activities or seek help.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year. Having some employment can provide stability, which usually reduces risk of certain behaviors. But it also means she might not have other sources of income if something happens, potentially leading to dependency on that single job.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. That's a significant red flag because drug use is strongly associated with various risky behaviors like alcohol abuse, unprotected sex, and other illegal activities. It also shows she might have ongoing struggles with addiction.\n\nIn the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This level of emotional distress can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which in turn increases risk of further issues like criminal behavior or family problems.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. High household size and living in an urban setting might contribute to stressors that could lead to risky behaviors later on.\n\nLastly, she believes in God. While religious belief can influence risk-taking behaviors (some people might make impulsive decisions based on faith), it's also a strong support system for many. So this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nPutting all these together: The arrest history, drug use, and emotional distress are the most concerning points here. While she has some positive attributes like living independently and being employed, the negative factors seem to outweigh them. Therefore, I'd lean towards a high risk with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
