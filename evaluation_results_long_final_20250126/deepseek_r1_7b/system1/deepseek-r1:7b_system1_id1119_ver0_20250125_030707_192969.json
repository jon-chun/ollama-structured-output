    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male from a Black background. I know racial factors can influence recidivism rates, so that should be considered.\n\nHe has been arrested six times but not convicted. More arrests usually mean higher risk because it shows inconsistent behavior or maybe past mistakes.\n\nHis height and weight are listed\u20146'2\" and 140 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless there's a history of being physically aggressive, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse or children, so he's an only child. Being an only child can sometimes mean higher risk in certain situations because of lack of supervision, but it depends on other factors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college\u2014lower education often correlates with higher chances of reoffending if not motivated enough.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year\u2014he's unemployed or underemployed. Unemployment can be a strong risk factor because it means he might struggle to support himself and find stable surroundings.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, but nothing about recent substance abuse. However, the fact that all of last month was bad mood makes me think he's currently struggling with mental health issues which could affect his ability to function or commit crimes.\n\nMood for the past month\u2014he felt down all the time. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues which might influence risk behavior.\n\nYoung age\u2014he lived in a household of four at an early age, so maybe there was family support but perhaps also neglect if he's now living alone.\n\nReligion\u2014he believes God has something to do with his personal life\u2014this can be protective against some types of recidivism because religious communities often have strong moral codes and support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple arrest records without convictions, low education, unemployment, drug use in the past, current mood issues. These factors point towards a high risk of reoffending or becoming more violent.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
