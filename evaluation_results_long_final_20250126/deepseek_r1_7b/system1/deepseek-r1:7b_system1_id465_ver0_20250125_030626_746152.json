    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the individual described. Let me go through each of the risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Her race might be a factor, but without knowing specific statistics on how race correlates with recidivism, I can't say much yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means her criminal history isn't too severe yet. Only one arrest could have limited opportunities for low-level convictions, which might affect her risk.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches and she weighs 130 lbs. Her body type doesn't immediately suggest any physical risks or health issues that could impact her ability to commit a crime or pose a threat.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if someone is unstable, but since she's single and presumably in a stable situation now, this might not be a strong indicator.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism because having a degree often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities suggests she's financially stable and not relying on crime as a means of survival or income replacement. This is a positive sign for low risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant factor in delinquency, so not using drugs at all could mean she's in better control of her substance use, which might lower her risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to risky behaviors, but since she hasn't experienced it herself recently, this is a good sign. It suggests her mental health is stable, which can prevent impulsive decisions linked to crime.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of three in an urban area. Experiencing family outside of biology can sometimes lead to different socialization and coping mechanisms, but since it's in an urban setting, maybe she has access to better resources or support, which might mitigate some risk factors.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This religious belief could provide a sense of moral guidance, which can reduce the likelihood of making impulsive or risky decisions driven by a lack of spirituality.\n\nPutting all these together: no prior convictions, low recidivism due to education and employment, stable living situation, no drug use, mental health appears good, and a strong moral framework. All these factors lean towards lower risk rather than high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
