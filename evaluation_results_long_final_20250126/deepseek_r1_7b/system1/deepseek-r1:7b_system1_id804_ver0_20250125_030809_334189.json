    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of mixed race. Age-wise, being in her late twenties might mean she has some life experience, but it's also early in her career, which could be a positive or negative depending on the situation.\n\nShe's been arrested seven times and convicted. That's a significant number of convictions; each arrest can increase recidivism risk factors. Multiple convictions usually indicate past problematic behavior that led to her being in trouble with the law before now.\n\nShe identified as mixed race, which doesn't directly relate to risk unless we consider societal implications, but since she's an individual, it's not a direct indicator here.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and weight 139 lbs. These don't immediately indicate risk without context on body fat or other health indicators.\n\nDivorced and living alone suggest she might be going through some personal challenges. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to emotional instability.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing higher education could mean she's looking for alternative paths but may also indicate lower self-esteem or motivation if not pursuing her goals.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Having some job experience suggests she can manage basic needs, but relying on past work history without current income might be a concern.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive; it shows responsibility and adherence to substance abuse issues.\n\nMost of the time during the past month, she's feeling very down. Emotional distress for an extended period could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues. If it's not addressed, this could escalate into more serious problems.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. That might suggest she has a history of family dynamics that could impact her current behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life. This is a positive spiritual aspect which can aid in personal motivation but may not directly correlate with risk factors if she's actively seeking help.\n\nConsidering all these, the most concerning factors are the multiple arrests, lack of college education, living situation, and prolonged emotional distress. These together suggest a high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
