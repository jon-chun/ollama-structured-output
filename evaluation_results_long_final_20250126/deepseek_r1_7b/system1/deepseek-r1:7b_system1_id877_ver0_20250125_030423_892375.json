    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male from White background. Age might not be too predictive on its own. His criminal history is only one arrest but no conviction, which could mean he's in good standing with the law so that's positive.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and 155 lbs. That's pretty tall for his weight; maybe he has some health issues or maybe not relevant here. Weight can sometimes relate to substance abuse, but since he hasn't used drugs in four years, that might negate that concern.\n\nLiving alone is common among young adults these days. No married status and living alone doesn't seem like a red flag on its own.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college\u2014so he's educated. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because they have more opportunities and better skills to find jobs or get help if needed.\n\nHe's held one job during the year; that's not much, but again, maybe just part-time? Not sure how that affects risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014great, that's a solid indicator against substance abuse issues. No depression over the past month\u2014that's also positive as it shows mental health is good.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four. That's a stable environment, so maybe lower risk factors there.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life\u2014which could be linked to higher self-esteem or lack thereof, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism rates. Maybe some connection to religion is important for support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: No prior convictions, stable living situation, good health indicators, education level, no drug use, low risk factors. The only thing that might be a concern is the lack of involvement with religion and maybe past unstable home environments as a child if they had more stressors beyond living with four people. But since he's in a household of four without any issues mentioned, it seems stable.\n\nHe's 22, so maybe too young to have significant life events yet. His age is usually protective against recidivism because he doesn't have established criminal behavior. He's got a clean record and good health indicators, which are all positive signs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
