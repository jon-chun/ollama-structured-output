    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old Black male with one arrest and no conviction. That's significant because having an arrest without a conviction can impact his chances of getting a job or housing, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's a high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 170 lbs. Not sure if that affects risk much on its own, but combined with other factors might be relevant later.\n\n living alone is mentioned; not married. That could relate to living situations which might have implications for substance use or other personal issues.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014this might mean he has some skills but also might be less likely to seek higher education support if needed, though that's speculative.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having work experience is usually a positive indicator of stability, so this could lower risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without recent depression might be related to other factors like substance abuse but not necessarily high risk on its own unless there's more info about it.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. That could imply a stable or perhaps extended family, but I don't know if that directly affects risk without knowing more about his current support system.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might relate to spirituality and mental health. If he doesn't seek help from religious sources, it might suggest he relies on other mechanisms for dealing with stress or problems, which could be a red flag if those mechanisms aren't working effectively.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the factors like living at a young age in an urban area, substance use without depression, and lack of religious/spiritual support are somewhat concerning. However, since he's 21 and has stable employment, it might not be as high risk as other cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
