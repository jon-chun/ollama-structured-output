    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female Hispanic, arrested five times and convicted. That's a history of multiple convictions; typically, that could be a sign of higher risk as more convictions might mean she has had trouble with the law before.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and 218 lbs. Weight doesn't usually directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or health issues, which I don't see here.\n\nMarried but living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of isolation, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors or substance abuse, though that's not explicitly mentioned.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Not completing college could lead to lower income and more involvement with social services or the criminal justice system.\n\nShe has two jobs during the year; employment is usually a positive factor as it can provide stability and reduce stress, so maybe this lowers her risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators suggesting she's maintaining good health and not experiencing harmful behaviors that could increase risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. That might suggest she has some support or exposure, but it also depends on other factors like family dynamics which aren't provided here.\n\nHer belief that God doesn't play a role in her life \u2014 this could indicate a lack of religious support, which might be associated with higher risk if she's involved in risky behaviors without strong moral guidance. However, she hasn't mentioned any such issues elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are concerning but not definitive on their own. Her employment is positive, health indicators are good, living alone doesn't directly correlate to high risk unless combined with other negatives like substance use or family issues. The lack of religious involvement could be a red flag if she's engaging in risky activities, but without specific behavior mentioned.\n\nI think the overall risk isn't extremely high because some factors point towards lower risk, especially her employment and health status. However, there are some concerning points about past criminal history that might indicate moderate to low risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
