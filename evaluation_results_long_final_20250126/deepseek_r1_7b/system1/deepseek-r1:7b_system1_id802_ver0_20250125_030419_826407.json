    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Being young and of a certain race might not directly indicate high risk unless there are systemic issues, but in this case, it doesn't seem to be the main focus.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a mitigating factor because being arrested without a conviction is less severe than having a conviction. So that's probably low risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't provide much info on risk factors. No indication of health issues there.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be an indicator of potential instability, but again, it depends on other factors like mental health.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is usually positive, so not attending might mean he's motivated to change his situation or seeking help.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is good; it suggests he can manage daily tasks and possibly find support through past experiences.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, but only recently felt really down. Drug use on its own might not be a high risk unless there are other issues like substance abuse causing problems.\n\nMood: Feeling down for extended periods could indicate depression or low mood, which can affect behavior and relationships, increasing risk.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area suggests he had a stable environment until recently. Urban areas can have different stressors, but living with both parents might provide support.\n\nBelieving that God has no role in his life could point to religious issues or lack of spirituality, which might relate to mental health challenges if these beliefs conflict with his actions.\n\nConsidering all factors, the drug use and mood issues seem significant. They indicate potential substance abuse problems and emotional instability, which are concerning but not necessarily high risk on their own without other red flags like violent behavior or criminal history beyond the arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
