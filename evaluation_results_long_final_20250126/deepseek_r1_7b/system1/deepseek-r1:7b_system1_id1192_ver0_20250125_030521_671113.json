    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black female who hasn't been convicted of any crime yet but has one arrest. She's married and living with her spouse, which might suggest she's stable or perhaps in a supportive environment that could help prevent further issues.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college, which might mean she's looking for opportunities to improve herself through education or training. Not holding any jobs during the year is concerning because it shows she hasn't found steady employment, which can contribute to financial instability and stressors that might lead to other problems.\n\nThe lack of drug use for four years is a positive sign. She doesn't feel depressed over the past month either, so her mental health seems okay at the moment. That's a good indicator as depression can sometimes be a precursor to more severe issues but in this case, she's managing it well.\n\nShe was living with her biological mother in an urban area when young. That might offer some sense of stability or close support, which could help mitigate risks. However, urban environments can also have higher stressors and crime rates, so that factor should be considered.\n\nHer religious involvement is something to note as well. Being involved in a religion like Christianity can provide moral guidance and support, potentially reducing risk factors associated with lack of spiritual anchor or environmental neglect.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest, no convictions, living with her spouse (which could be supportive), GED not enrolled, no job, no drug use, no depression symptoms. The urban environment isn't directly linked to her current risk but might influence past behavior. Her personal circumstances and mental health are positive.\n\nI don't see any red flags that would indicate a high risk based on these factors alone. She seems to be in a relatively stable situation without immediate triggers for further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
