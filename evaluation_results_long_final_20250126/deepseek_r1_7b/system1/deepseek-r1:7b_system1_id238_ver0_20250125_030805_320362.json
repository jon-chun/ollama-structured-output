    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male from a criminal justice perspective. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. While race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, this alone isn't high risk unless other factors are present. He has been arrested three times but not convicted. Repeated arrests often indicate unstable situations or lack of commitment to resolving past issues, which could be a red flag.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch\u2014though height doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, it might suggest he's in a stable living situation since he's currently living alone. No high school diploma and no GED suggests he may not have completed his education, which can lead to substance abuse and unstable employment. Being out of college could contribute to lack of skills or motivation.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Single job experience might mean limited financial stability or opportunities for upward mobility. He has used marijuana in the past four years\u2014substance use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it's recent or frequent.\n\nHis mood was so low that nothing could cheer him up recently\u2014it indicates emotional distress, which can lead to substance abuse and self-harm behaviors. Living with eight people at a young age implies a history of family issues, which can contribute to mental health challenges affecting his ability to function responsibly.\n\nConsidering he believes in God as part of his life\u2014religion can have both protective and harmful effects depending on the individual's context and how it influences their behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests without convictions, limited education, substance use, emotional distress, living with a large family, and a possible lack of stable environment. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of future criminal behavior or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
