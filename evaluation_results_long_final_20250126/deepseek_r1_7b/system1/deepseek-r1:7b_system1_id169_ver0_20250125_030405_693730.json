    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from White background. arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant number of convictions; being under 25 means that any criminal history could have long-term effects on his risk assessment. Multiple arrests often indicate past problematic behavior which can predict future issues.\n\nHe's tall at 6'0\" and weighs 210 lbs, so he's quite hefty. This might be a sign of substance abuse or obesity, both of which are risk factors. He's never been married and is living alone. Living alone without supervision could lead to isolation, which can increase stress and the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe he's under some form of financial strain since he's not continuing his education. Not having an active degree might mean he needs support which he doesn't have access to right now.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, so he's employed at least once before. That suggests some stability but also that he was able to find work despite his issues. Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana specifically) indicates ongoing substance use, which is a strong risk factor for both health and criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so his mental health isn't showing signs of severe issues recently. However, substance abuse can sometimes lead to mental health problems, though he's not experiencing it now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. That suggests he was raised in a stable environment but maybe surrounded by family who could have influenced his behavior positively or negatively. Religiously believing that God has something to do with his personal events might indicate a certain level of moral accountability, which can be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests suggest past problems, body weight and living situation hint at possible substance abuse or instability, lack of college education points towards financial strain or support issues, two job histories show some ability but not stability. However, the fact that he's using marijuana (albeit not strongly affecting his mood) and has a history of criminal behavior could point towards ongoing risky tendencies.\n\nThe high school diploma might mean he's aware of his options but isn't utilizing them, which can sometimes lead to complacency or neglecting responsibilities. His current living situation alone without support is a risk factor for isolation and potential self-harm.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think this person does have a high risk score because despite some protective factors like having a high school diploma and living in an urban area with family nearby, the multiple arrests, substance use, and lack of college enrollment suggest underlying issues that could lead to further problems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
