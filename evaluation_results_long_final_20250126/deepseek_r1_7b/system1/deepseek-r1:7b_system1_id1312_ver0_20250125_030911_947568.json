    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute to risk assessment.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Race can be a factor in predictive analytics because of potential systemic issues, but I don't have specific data on how that affects him here. He has been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior legal issues, which could show he's struggled with the system before.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 11 inches and 158 lbs. Not sure if that relates directly to risk unless there are other factors, but I don't see a connection here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a red flag because it shows instability. Not being employed might mean he relies on social programs or has had issues finding steady work, which could increase risk if those situations persist.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to higher chances of positive outcomes, so not having a degree can be a negative indicator. Maybe lack of education contributes to other risk factors like substance use.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without concurrent depression might suggest he's using them recreationally or trying to hide problems, which could be risky if it affects his mental health or relationships.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an11-person household in a rural area. That's quite a large family living together, and being in a rural setting can have its challenges\u2014maybe environment, access to resources, etc. However, the size of the household could also mean more support or fewer problems.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This is a strong indicator of lack of spirituality or religious involvement. Without a supportive network from religion, he might struggle with emotional health and social connections, which are important for risk assessment.\n\nPutting this all together: prior arrest (even if not convicted), no job, no education, living alone, drug use without recent depression, and a lack of spiritual support. These factors point towards high risk because he's facing several challenges that could lead to further issues\u2014unemployment, substance abuse, instability in personal relationships or family.\n\nI'm going to say the prediction is \"YES\" with high confidence because multiple risk indicators are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
