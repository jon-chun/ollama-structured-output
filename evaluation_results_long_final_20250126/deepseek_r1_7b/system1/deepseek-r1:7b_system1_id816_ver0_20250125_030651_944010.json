    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old female named Maria. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White. I'm not sure how much of an impact race has on recidivism rates, but generally, it doesn't correlate directly unless there are systemic issues in the area she lives. Since she's young and only been arrested once, maybe that's a minor offense which could be overlooked.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and 110 lbs. Weight can sometimes indicate physical health risks, like if she has underlying issues or is at higher risk for certain crimes. But without more info on her health, it's hard to say. Her current living situation: not alone yet, which could be a red flag because being in a shared environment might suggest substance abuse issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates as it can lead to better job opportunities and stable environments. Being enrolled suggests she's motivated for learning but doesn't directly relate to risk unless she's struggling academically, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single job experience is generally positive; having a steady income can help with financial stability and reduce stress. But if she lost it due to substance use or other issues, maybe that's a concern. She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't severe, but drug abuse can have long-term effects on mental health and relationships.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which is positive since depression often leads to substance abuse or neglect of responsibilities. Her family background: lived with both parents at age 6 in a household of four rural area. Being raised in such an environment could mean she has high values and strong support systems, but it's also possible that living in poverty affects her mental health.\n\nShe believes God is not involved in her life. That can lead to feelings of isolation or lack of direction, which might contribute to risky behaviors like drug use or neglecting responsibilities.\n\nPutting this all together: The job experience seems positive, education is good, family background isn't a problem but might have its own issues. The only negative factors are marijuana use and her belief in God. Since she's White and young with no major prior convictions beyond the past year, I think the risk is moderate to low.\n\nBut considering she has a history of substance abuse (past four years) even if it's marijuana, which might be linked to higher future use, maybe that increases risk slightly. Also, her belief in God could affect her mental health and relationships indirectly.\n\nOverall, without more information on her current living situation or any other risk factors like substance abuse frequency or recent trauma, I'd lean towards a low confidence of high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
