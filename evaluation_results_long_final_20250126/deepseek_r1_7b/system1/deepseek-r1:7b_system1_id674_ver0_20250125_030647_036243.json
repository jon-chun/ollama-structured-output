    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for someone involved in criminal justice. The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because prior conviction rates are often associated with recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 171 lbs. At that age, being underweight could be a sign of past issues or maybe even some health problems, but I'm not sure how much weight he gains now. His height might also affect his physical activity levels or mobility if there are any underlying health conditions.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of possible stress or isolation, which might contribute to criminal behavior. Plus, without a support system, it could increase the risk of engaging in risky activities.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma and he's not enrolled in college. Maybe this indicates a lack of further education or training that could help him avoid getting involved in the criminal justice system again. Without additional education, there might be fewer opportunities to learn new skills or positive alternatives.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which suggests limited financial stability or opportunities for upward mobility. Joblessness can lead to dependency on social services and potentially more involvement with the criminal system.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is a positive sign; substance abuse and mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism. So, this factor might actually lower his risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size nine. That's a large family environment, which could have both protective and detrimental effects. While larger families can provide more support, sometimes they can also create environments conducive to substance abuse or neglect if not properly supervised.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal fate, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. Beliefs in higher power often correlate with better outcomes compared to secular beliefs.\n\nPutting all this together: prior conviction, living alone, limited education and job opportunities, potential health issues from being underweight, family size at a young age, and religious belief are mixed signals but lean towards high risk because of the criminal history, isolation, and limited support. The other factors like no drug use and recent mental health status are good indicators that might mitigate some risk.\n\nTherefore, I would assess this person as having a high risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
