    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old, which is quite young. Young adults often have unstable lives and may engage in risky behavior. So that's a red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think his race is directly related to the risk unless there are systemic issues, which isn't indicated here. So maybe less of an impact on risk assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can indicate past behavior issues or possible substance use problems leading him into trouble. Since he's not convicted, it might mean he's managed to avoid legal consequences, which could be a mitigating factor, but I still need to consider other factors.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight between 150-174 lbs. That places him in the average to slightly above-average range for his age. Weight isn't necessarily directly linked to risk unless it's obesity, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So maybe not a significant factor.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which he's expressing by feeling down for much of the month. Loneliness can increase substance use or other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism. This could contribute to a higher risk level.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lack of formal education might correlate with higher involvement in less successful career paths, possibly leading him towards drugs or other risky activities.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is generally positive as it can provide stability, but if he's relying on these for substance use, that could be a problem. However, holding two jobs might indicate some financial independence which isn't shown here to be problematic yet.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt down for most of the past month. Drug use is a clear indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to risky behaviors like self-harm or involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\nHis young age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests exposure to family dynamics that might include neglect or abuse. This could contribute to emotional vulnerabilities and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a strong indicator of moral support and generally positive life choices, but it's subjective and varies widely among individuals.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: young age, past marijuana use, living with family in an urban setting, some substance abuse, lack of education, limited work experience, two prior arrests. These points collectively suggest a high risk potential.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
