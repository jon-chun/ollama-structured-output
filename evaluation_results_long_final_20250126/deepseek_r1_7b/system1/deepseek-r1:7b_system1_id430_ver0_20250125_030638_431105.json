I'm an experienced criminal justice expert, so I need to analyze the given factors thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White female with one arrest and no conviction. That alone doesn't indicate high risk since she's not convicted yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here unless there's a health concern, but they're just basic demographics.\n\nShe's divorced and living with others, which might suggest some instability, but without more info on her living situation or family dynamics, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. GED holders are often more stable, so not being enrolled might indicate she's focused elsewhere\u2014maybe less likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nHaving one job shows employability, which is positive as it suggests she can support herself without needing external help.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and minimal activity during the last month points towards good self-discipline. That's a red flag for low risk.\n\nAt a young age, living with three people could mean she's experienced, but it also might suggest she's adapted well to some environment.\n\nHer lack of religious affiliation is interesting. Sometimes, not believing in God can be linked to substance abuse or neglecting personal responsibilities, which are higher risks.\n\nPutting this all together: low convictions, stable employment, no drug use, and positive self-discipline suggest lower risk. The factors don't point towards high-risk behavior but might indicate she's managed her situation well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
