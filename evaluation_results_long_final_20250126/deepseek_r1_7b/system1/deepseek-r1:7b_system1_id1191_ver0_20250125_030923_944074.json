    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, which can be associated with certain systemic risks in the criminal justice system but isn't inherently predictive unless other factors are present. \n\nHe has two arrests and a conviction. Two prior convictions are significant because they increase the likelihood of reoffending. Convictions, especially for serious crimes, are strong indicators of past behavior that might influence future risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 152 lbs. While body weight can be a factor in recidivism studies, it's less directly predictive than other factors unless combined with other metrics like BMI or prior weight-related offenses.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support networks which might affect his ability to reintegrate after incarceration but isn't inherently high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; not completing education may increase risk, so this factor points towards higher risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment status can affect reintegration, and having no job might mean he relies on other factors like support networks or substance use for stability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a potential substance abuse issue which can contribute to unstable behavior and higher risk of relapse or involvement in further crimes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health issues are important, not feeling depressed doesn't guarantee he won't experience it in the future.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area suggests exposure to certain environments that might have influences on his behavior and risk factors.\n\nConsidering God's involvement indicates he has some religious support which can be protective but isn't directly tied to criminal risk unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nPutting all these together, the presence of two prior convictions is a strong indicator. The lack of education, employment, living alone, substance use, and possible mental health issues also contribute. While there are mitigating factors like his biological background and religious involvement, the overall profile leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
