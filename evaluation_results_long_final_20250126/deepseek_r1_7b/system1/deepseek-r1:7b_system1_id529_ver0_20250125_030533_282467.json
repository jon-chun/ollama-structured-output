    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old male. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 19 and has been arrested twice, which is a red flag indicating past trouble. Being Hispanic isn't directly related to risk but might suggest a different background that could influence other factors.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem concerning unless there's an underlying health issue, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be risky as he might not have support, especially in emergency situations.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is significant because educational attainment often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled in college could mean he's not seeking help or opportunities, which might increase risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs, so work experience isn't a major red flag unless it's unstable. No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive signs but don't necessarily negate risk if past issues matter more.\n\nHis young age and living with his biological mother suggest a challenging upbringing, which can have long-term effects on behavior and stability.\n\nConsidering his religious beliefs might indicate he has support systems within his faith community, which could mitigate some risks. However, the other factors are still concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, despite some positive aspects like no recent drug use and religion involvement, the history of arrest, lack of education, living alone, and past unstable family environment point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
