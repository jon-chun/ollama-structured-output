    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly contribute to risk but might be considered in other contexts. She has one arrest without a conviction; that alone isn't too concerning since it's not a full conviction. Her height and weight are within typical ranges for her age and gender, so no significant health indicators there.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which is common among young adults. No immediate red flags from that. High school diploma but not in college\u2014consistent with being in her early 20s. Employed four jobs during the year; job instability isn't a major issue unless she had significant issues, which I don't see here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Since she's relatively young and has been using for a short time, this might be a trend that could stabilize or change with time. No immediate evidence of substance abuse impacting her life.\n\nAt a young age, lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area\u2014could indicate family environment issues but at 21, she's probably had some growth out of that situation. Her religious belief about God affecting her personal life is positive and doesn't raise red flags.\n\nCombining all these factors, there are no major warning signs like multiple prior convictions, substance abuse leading to significant issues, or unstable living conditions. The only slightly concerning point is the drug use over four years, but she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest it's manageable.\n\nSo overall, I think the risk level isn't high enough to warrant a YES, so my prediction would be NO with low confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
