He's enrolled in school and currently living alone, which might indicate he's trying hard to stay on track. He has a history of using marijuana in the past four years and feels very down every month now.\n\nHe was raised with his biological mother in an urban area by himself at young age, which could contribute to social or emotional challenges. He acknowledges the role of God in his life, so he's probably doing things ethically but might lack support systems that could help him cope with stress or setbacks.\n\nThe fact that he's been arrested once and hasn't been convicted suggests he's not a significant risk yet, but the recent substance use and mood issues make me cautious. He's managing school and living alone, which are positive signs of self-direction, but his past substance abuse might indicate underlying mental health issues that could worsen if not addressed.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while he hasn't shown violent behavior or other clear high-risk indicators, the combination of past drug use, potential social isolation from being raised alone, and acknowledging personal struggles points towards a moderate risk level. I'd predict \"YES\" with 40% confidence because there are signs that could worsen if not managed effectively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
