    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a Black individual. I remember reading somewhere that race can influence risk assessments, sometimes leading to higher estimates of recidivism. But maybe it depends on other factors too.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because past arrests could indicate potential for future crimes. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe the risk is lower than if she were in prison or served time.\n\nHer height and weight: 5 feet 6 inches and 190 lbs. I'm not sure how these physical attributes relate to recidivism directly, but combined with her being 19, which is a young age, perhaps this isn't immediately concerning. Maybe she's still in school or working part-time.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Unmarried status and living alone are generally associated with lower risk because they reduce the likelihood of family support or issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which suggests good educational attainment. People with higher education levels tend to have lower recidivism rates because they're more likely to find stable jobs and contribute positively to society.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least some income can be beneficial for her financial stability and self-sufficiency, reducing the risk of dependency on others or engaging in illegal activities.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression symptoms indicate good mental health, which is a positive factor contributing to lower risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That's a complex family situation; sometimes living with multiple relatives can lead to different dynamics but might also mean she has support from extended family, which could be protective rather than harmful.\n\nHer belief in God shows a strong moral compass, which is another positive indicator that she's likely to make responsible decisions.\n\nPutting it all together: Only one arrest, not convicted, no drug use, stable living situation, positive educational background, single job, good mental health, supportive family environment. These factors seem to lean towards lower risk. I don't see any red flags that would indicate a high risk. Maybe she's at moderate risk but not high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
