    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of race as a predictive factor, though it's worth noting she's young and may have different life experiences compared to older individuals.\n\nShe has been arrested 9 times and convicted. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of criminal history, which is typically associated with higher risk of reoffending. Each arrest adds to her criminal record, making her more likely to engage in similar behavior again.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 3 inches and weight is 105 lbs. These measurements don't directly correlate with risk unless there's an issue with her health or substance use, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's never been married and currently not living alone. Being single could be a factor depending on other circumstances, but without more context, it's hard to assess how living situation ties into risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can influence her opportunities and decision-making. Not being enrolled might indicate she's facing challenges or lack of motivation.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Having recent unemployment could suggest instability, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates as individuals may struggle to find gainful employment again.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) indicates substance abuse. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for criminal behavior and health issues, which can impede personal responsibility and contribute to further risks.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While lack of depression might seem positive, it's possible she experiences it intermittently or in different contexts, so this alone doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother at a young age in an urban area suggests she was raised by her birth parents. This could have various implications on her behavior and relationships, but without specific issues related to that environment, it's hard to assess as a risk factor.\n\nLastly, she believes God has no role in her life. This lack of religious involvement can be associated with certain risk behaviors if not integrated into her life positively, but again, context is important here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests are a significant red flag, followed by factors like substance abuse and potentially unstable living situation which could contribute to higher risk. Educational attainment being low might also suggest she faces barriers that could increase risk. The single status and recent unemployment also add to the risk profile.\n\nConsidering these points collectively, it's likely that this individual is at high risk based on her arrest history, substance use, and other factors that indicate potential instability or increased criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
