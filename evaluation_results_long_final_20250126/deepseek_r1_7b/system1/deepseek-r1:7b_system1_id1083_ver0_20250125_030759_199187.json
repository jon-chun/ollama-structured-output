    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice and convicted. His height is 5'11\", weight between 200-224 lbs. He's single, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college, never worked, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed in a month. Young age of living with 11 people and religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is significant\u2014he's been arrested twice, which shows he has a history of issues that could impact his future behavior. Being Black might indicate some systemic factors contributing to his criminal behavior, so that adds to the risk.\n\nHis weight range isn't immediately alarming unless it affects health, but given his height and other factors, maybe not directly relevant here. He's single and living alone; perhaps indicative of some instability or lack of support system.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests he might have struggled with education, which could affect his job prospects and ability to contribute positively in society. Not being enrolled in college means he's likely not seeking higher education, potentially leading him towards underutilized skills.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the year, so no income stability. That could put pressure on those around him or increase dependence on other factors like drug use.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) is present but doesn't always indicate severe substance abuse unless it's affecting his mental health. He hasn't felt depressed in a month, which might suggest he's managing without significant mental health issues, but that could also be a reflection of his environment or current coping mechanisms.\n\nAt a young age living with 11 people shows he had a difficult upbringing, which often correlates with higher risk of recidivism due to family dysfunction or exposure to negative influences. His religious beliefs might provide some support and guidance, potentially mitigating some risks, but it's not enough on its own.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple past criminal issues, lack of education and job experience, living alone, drug use without severe mental health issues, and a challenging upbringing from a young age. These factors point towards a high risk of reoffending or negative outcomes in the future.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
