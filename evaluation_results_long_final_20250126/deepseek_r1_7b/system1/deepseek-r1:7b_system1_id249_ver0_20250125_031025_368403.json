    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, which doesn't directly contribute to risk unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting his background, but that's not specified here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's significant because prior convictions can increase future risk of reoffending. So this is a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight between 225-249 lbs. Underweight or overweight can sometimes be associated with substance abuse issues, but since he hasn't been diagnosed with that yet, it's unclear if it's contributing here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation alone doesn't inherently indicate risk unless there are other factors like unstable connections, but without more info, this is neutral.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school suggests he's focused on improving his education, which might reduce future criminal behavior, so maybe mitigates risk a bit.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities can indicate responsibility and stability, which usually reduces recidivism risk. So that's a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't always a bad sign if he's managing it, but sometimes substance abuse can lead to other risky behaviors. However, since he doesn't report recent depression, maybe this is less concerning.\n\nHe was raised in a household of four with both parents at a young age in an urban area. This indicates a stable or somewhat supportive early family environment, which might reduce risk factors associated with poverty or neglect.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with prosocial behaviors or substance use, but it's not directly tied to criminal risk without more info.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction is a big red flag (high risk), living in an urban area might have better resources which could support him rather than increase risk if he's struggling. His education and stable family are positive signs. Drug use alone isn't a deal-breaker, but the lack of recent depression is interesting.\n\nConsidering all factors, I'd lean towards high risk because of the prior conviction and possible substance use issues despite the other mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
