    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female from White background. Age is usually not a big factor in risk assessment unless it's significantly higher or lower than average, but 22 seems about right. Her race doesn't typically indicate risk without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. So, two arrests mean she's been involved with the law before, which can sometimes show underlying issues like substance abuse or unstable family environment. But since no convictions, maybe she's not actively breaking laws now.\n\nShe is 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. That seems within a normal range, so no indication of weight-related issues here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Being co-habiting without being married might suggest potential emotional or relational issues, which could affect her risk level.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Maybe she's seeking further education on her own initiative, so that might not be a red flag.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. One job is manageable; consistent work can contribute to stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. Positive indicators here, as substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors when present.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of six. That's a big family, which could indicate high dependency or unstable living conditions for her growing up. This might point to past instability affecting her current behavior or emotions.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks it affects her personal life positively. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective but depends on how it's integrated into her daily life.\n\nPutting this all together: two arrests, living with an extended family, and some other factors. The lack of convictions might reduce the immediate risk, but past negative experiences (like living with multiple relatives) could indicate a higher risk for issues like addiction or emotional problems in the future.\n\nSo, considering these points, I'd lean towards high risk because of the past instability from living in a big family and potential underlying issues indicated by the arrests. But since she's not convicted yet, maybe her current risk is lower than someone with recent convictions but still higher than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
