    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male Hispanic with two arrests and a conviction. That's a significant negative indicator because recidivism is common among young, minority\u7537\u6027. His weight and height don't immediately stand out as concerning in terms of risk assessment.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be associated with higher risk due to potential isolation, but it's not the most direct factor here. He's never married and has a high school diploma without college enrollment\u2014this might suggest he's looking for more opportunities, possibly increasing future involvement in the system.\n\nHe's worked three jobs, which is positive as steady employment can reduce recidivism. His drug use history (marijuana only in the past four years) shows minimal substance abuse, so that's a minor negative but not severe.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month\u2014no clear link to risk here unless there's a history of depression related to substance use or other factors. His early household size of 4 suggests he might have had multiple supportive relationships, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nHis religious belief in God is positive as it often correlates with personal stability and moral guidance. Overall, considering all these factors, the positives slightly outweigh the negatives. He's young, has a clean enough record except for two arrests, and other indicators don't strongly suggest high risk. So, I would lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
