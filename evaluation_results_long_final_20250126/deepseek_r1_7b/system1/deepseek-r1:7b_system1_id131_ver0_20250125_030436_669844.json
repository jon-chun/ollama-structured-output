    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Racial minority groups often have higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like police stops and discrimination in the justice system. So that's a red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Each prior conviction can increase his chances of reoffending. In fact, each new arrest is typically more dangerous than previous ones because he knows how the court handles it now.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches, weight 156 lbs. These factors don't seem directly related to risk unless there's something about his body type that affects his ability or behavior, but nothing stands out here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can influence support systems; being alone might mean fewer social resources which could contribute to higher risk of substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a big indicator of future stability. Without education, he has fewer opportunities and may turn to more risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the past year. Losing income can lead to dependency on substances as a way to cope with stress or lack of support, which increases risk.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can impair judgment and contribute to further issues. The lack of recent depression might suggest he's not under significant stress, which could be a double-edged sword.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This indicates he was raised in a multi-parent family living in an urban setting. Urban environments can have higher rates of crime and substance abuse due to lack of community support or access to resources.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't specify if that affects his behavior or decision-making regarding risky activities like drug use or not seeking help for mental health issues.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests, no education, unemployment, living alone, drug use history. All these factors contribute significantly to high risk of reoffending and involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
