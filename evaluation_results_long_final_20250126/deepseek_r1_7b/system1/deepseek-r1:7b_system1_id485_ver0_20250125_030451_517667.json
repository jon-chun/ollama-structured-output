    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old White male. Age is quite young, but being White doesn't inherently make him more or less risky on its own. However, it might be relevant in terms of other factors like socioeconomic status or community ties, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate a history of behavior that could be problematic, even if he's not fully convicted yet. The number of prior convictions is low, so maybe this isn't too significant on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and between 150-174 lbs. That places him in an average to slightly above-average range. Weight can sometimes be associated with health issues, but since he's not convicted yet, I'm not sure how that affects risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently might suggest better self-reliance, which could be a positive sign for risk management. But it also means he might have less social support, which can sometimes increase risk in certain situations.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, which shows he has goals and is taking responsibility of his education. This could indicate a lower likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like substance use or criminal activity because he's focused on academics.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having a job suggests some level of stability and responsibility. However, if it's a low-paying or unstable job, that might be a concern, but since it's mentioned as a job, I think it's less likely to be a high risk factor unless there are issues with it.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is only marijuana, which doesn't have a strong association with severe criminal behavior. He also admitted to feeling down and couldn't find cheer during the last month. This could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues, both of which can affect judgment and risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four. Larger households might provide more support but could also mean less parental supervision if it's extended family. However, since he's an 18-year-old who has been arrested once, maybe there was some neglect or conflict at home that contributed to his current issues.\n\nConsidering God as having no role in his life suggests he doesn't practice religion, which might affect his moral compass or support system. This could lead him toward certain risky behaviors influenced by secularism or a lack of guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has some minor past issues but not convictions, isn't married yet, is living alone with school and a job, so he's actively engaged in life. The main concerns are his drug use (marijuana only), the emotional state where he feels down and can't find cheer, and his living situation which might be influenced by family dynamics or lack of support.\n\nThe marijuana use isn't particularly concerning as it doesn't have severe penalties. His emotional state could be a risk factor if it leads to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. The fact that he's in school and employed suggests he's managing his time well, but if the job is problematic, that could change things.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think the highest risk here comes from his emotional state and potential for substance use or behavioral issues despite not having prior convictions. His young age might mean he has more room to develop, but with no full convictions, it's a bit of a gray area.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\nThis prediction is based on the consideration that despite not having prior convictions and being actively engaged in school and employment, factors like past substance use and emotional state may indicate some level of risk.",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
