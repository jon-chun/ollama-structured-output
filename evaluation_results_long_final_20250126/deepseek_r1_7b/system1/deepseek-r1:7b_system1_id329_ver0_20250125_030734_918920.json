    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk factors indicate a high risk based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female of White descent. She's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which often correlate with higher recidivism rates. So that might point towards high risk.\n\nShe's 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 130 lbs. I don't know if these physical characteristics are relevant here unless there's some association with behavior or health issues, but they don't immediately strike me as factors related to risk assessment in criminal justice.\n\nShe hasn't been married and isn't living alone currently. Not being married could influence her support network; perhaps she relies on others for help, which might affect her ability to commit further crimes if she feels supported.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED can sometimes lead to lower educational opportunities, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Not being enrolled in college could mean she's not gaining new skills that might deter her from such behavior.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally associated with lower recidivism because it provides financial stability and a sense of purpose. Having two jobs is positive, which might reduce risk.\n\nIn the past four years, she used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially cannabis, can be a red flag for other drug use or mental health issues. Not feeling depressed could mean she's managing her mental health well, or maybe she doesn't associate drug use with significant emotional distress.\n\nShe lived at a young age in a household of five, which was urban. Living with multiple family members might have had various effects\u2014perhaps it provided support but could also lead to dependency issues if there are underlying problems. Being in an urban area may offer more opportunities for risk-taking behaviors or access to environments where such behavior is common.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal events, indicating a level of spirituality. This might influence her behavior; sometimes religious beliefs can provide guidance and deter certain negative actions, but it's also possible she uses religion as an excuse or to cope with stress.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. The living situation in an urban area, especially with multiple family members, could indicate instability or environments conducive to risky behavior. The lack of college enrollment and GED might correlate with substance use or limited opportunities, which can increase risk. Her marijuana use without recent depression is concerning but not definitive unless there's evidence of other drug use.\n\nHer employment track is positive, though. She's been working two jobs, which could contribute to stability and reduce future criminal behavior. Her spirituality might either mitigate or complicate the risk assessment if it's affecting her substance use or decision-making.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because of the prior convictions and living circumstances that might place her in an environment conducive to risky decisions. However, her employment is a mitigating factor. I'll estimate a confidence level around 75% since there are some positives but also notable negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
