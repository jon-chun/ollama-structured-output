    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise concerns unless we know his criminal history or other traits. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag but not necessarily life-threatening on its own.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem significant here. Age-wise, being 20 puts him just out of high school, so that's probably not an issue. He's living alone, which could be a sign of instability or substance abuse, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is single now. Marital status doesn't usually predict risk unless there's something negative about his relationships, but he just says he's living alone, so maybe no direct link.\n\nHis education level: high school diploma and not in college. That might indicate some motivation or perhaps a lack of higher education opportunities that could lead to more risky behavior. But it's also possible he's seeking better opportunities.\n\nHe has worked four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experience is usually positive; it shows responsibility and ability to handle various responsibilities, which can sometimes correlate with lower risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high-risk behavior unless there's other drug abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe's never been married, so no family history to consider here. However, his upbringing is mentioned\u2014he lived with both parents at age 20 in a household of four in a rural area. That might suggest a stable environment, but rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics compared to urban settings, which could influence risk factors.\n\nHis religious affiliation is noted; he believes God plays a role in his life. Religious individuals often have strong moral values that can contribute to lower risk behavior when applied consistently.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest and conviction, which does suggest some risk but not extremely high. No immediate red flags like multiple prior convictions or serious offenses. His background seems relatively stable, living alone might indicate he's managing his environment well, though it could also be a sign of potential isolation. His education level, job experience, and no recent mental health issues are positive indicators.\n\nHowever, considering the one arrest and his current living situation, I might lean towards low risk but not extremely high. The confidence here is set at 60% since there's some risk due to past convictions but other mitigating factors that reduce overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
