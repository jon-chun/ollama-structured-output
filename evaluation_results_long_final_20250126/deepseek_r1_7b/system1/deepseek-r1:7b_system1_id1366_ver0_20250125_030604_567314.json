    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of issue\u2014maybe criminal behavior or something else. The person is a 21-year-old White female who was arrested once and convicted. She's 5'4\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs, which isn't extremely high but not particularly low either.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. She has a high school diploma and is in college for two years. That suggests she might be relatively stable education-wise, maybe looking to further her education or career. She's held four jobs in the past year. That indicates some experience and possibly some ability since she's maintained employment despite prior arrests.\n\nShe uses drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This could be a red flag because substance use can sometimes lead to other issues, like criminal behavior or health problems. But it also might not directly correlate with high risk if she's feeling okay mentally now.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That suggests she grew up in a multi-parent environment in a city. It could indicate some level of socialization but also potential family dynamics to consider.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal life. That's a strong indicator of religious involvement, which can sometimes be associated with stability or certain behaviors, though it doesn't directly point to risk without more context.\n\nGiven all these factors, she has a prior conviction but only one arrest. Her education is ongoing, she's living independently, and while she uses drugs, she hasn't been depressed recently. The urban household might suggest some exposure to different environments or stressors.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" because of the prior conviction and drug use, which are significant risk factors. However, her age and education level lower the risk compared to someone with more serious issues. The living situation doesn't immediately point towards high risk but could be a factor in other contexts. The lack of marriage and living alone might suggest she's focused on herself or her studies.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think there's enough reason to consider her as having a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
