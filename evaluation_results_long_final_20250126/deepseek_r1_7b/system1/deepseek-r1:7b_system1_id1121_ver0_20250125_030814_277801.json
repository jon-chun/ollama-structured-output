    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk and respond with a JSON object saying \"YES\" or \"NO\" along with confidence between 0 and 100. \n\nFirst, let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, he's quite young, which might influence his decision-making and life choices. Being Black could be a socioeconomic factor; sometimes there are systemic issues that affect recidivism rates. But at this point, I don't see anything red flags about his race.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. So, one prior arrest doesn't usually indicate high risk unless it's a serious offense or if there were any mitigating factors. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month and hasn't used drugs in the last four years. That sounds positive; no substance abuse history which is a good sign for low risk.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, without a high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. This could be due to various reasons like lack of motivation or financial issues. Maybe he hasn't found stable employment yet because of his situation. That might put him at higher risk since not having education can limit opportunities.\n\nHe's never held a job during the year, which again raises concerns about financial stability and life skills that come from working. No ties to a support network could mean he has fewer resources for getting help or staying out of trouble if needed.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a crowded living situation which might have contributed to some stress or social issues. Urban environments can sometimes be more challenging socially compared to rural areas, but without knowing the specifics of the environment, it's hard to say.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and feels that nothing is out of his control, which suggests he might not seek help from religious or supportive groups. That could mean he's less likely to get support when needed, increasing risk factors.\n\nNow, considering all these points: one prior arrest, no substance abuse, positive emotional state, but low education, lack of employment, living alone, and a negative outlook on life. These might indicate that he doesn't have strong ties or resources to prevent him from falling into trouble again. \n\nHis age is also a consideration\u2014he's 19, so maybe still developing his skills and relationships. However, the other factors are more concerning. \n\nI think these risk factors together point towards a higher risk of reoffending because he lacks education, has limited job experience, no ties to a support system, and doesn't feel controlled by external factors like religion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I would rate this as high risk with around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
