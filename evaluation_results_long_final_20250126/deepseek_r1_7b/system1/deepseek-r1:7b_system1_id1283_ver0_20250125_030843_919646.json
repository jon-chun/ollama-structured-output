    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, 20 isn't that old, but being Black can be an indicator of higher crime rates in some contexts. I remember reading that Black individuals make up a smaller percentage of the population and might have different risk profiles compared to others.\n\nHe's been arrested eight times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests. Repeated criminal behavior is usually a strong indicator of high risk because it suggests past problematic behavior which could lead to more issues now.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and he weighs between 150-174 lbs, which would put him in the lower end of the BMI spectrum for his height. However, weight alone isn't a major risk factor unless combined with other factors like being sedentary or having health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk because there are fewer people to support you if something goes wrong. Also, not being married might mean he has less financial stability or support network.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school can be associated with lower educational attainment, which is often linked to higher crime rates and unstable personal situations.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment for extended periods can lead to dependency issues, both financial and social. Being out of work without trying might indicate a lack of motivation or skills that could be useful in finding better opportunities.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (specifically marijuana) but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can lead to behavioral problems, but the absence of recent depression isn't as strong an indicator unless there's a history of mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in an environment where he has limited support or where he might have experienced abuse or neglect can increase risk because he didn't have a strong family to fall back on as an adult.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of faith or spirituality, which some people associate with different types of behavior. However, without more context on how this affects his actions, it's a bit neutral.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions (8 times), living alone, no job, GED, drug use in the past four years, and a history of being raised in a potentially stressful home. These factors are often associated with higher risk of recidivism and other negative outcomes. The lack of recent depression is interesting but not as critical without a history.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards high risk, maybe around 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
