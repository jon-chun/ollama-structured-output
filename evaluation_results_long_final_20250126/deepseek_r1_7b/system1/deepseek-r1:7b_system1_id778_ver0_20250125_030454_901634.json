Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is generally low risk unless there are other factors. She has been arrested twice and convicted. Recidivism can be a significant risk factor because prior convictions often lead to future criminal behavior.\n\nShe is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs, which doesn't seem out of the ordinary on its own but could be relevant if considering BMI or health risks, though that's not mentioned here.\n\nDivorced and living alone. Living alone can increase stress and social isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates; without education, she might be more likely to engage in risky activities.\n\nNot working during the year could lead to dependency issues, such as turning to drugs or other substances when stressed. She hasn't used drugs in the past four years but felt down for some months. Feelings of low mood can sometimes precede substance use or other negative behaviors.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such conditions might contribute to emotional instability, which could be linked to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nLastly, she believes that God is involved in her life, which is generally protective but can vary based on individual interpretation and circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: prior convictions (high risk), living alone (possible isolation stress), lack of education (may lead to dependency), recent feelings of low mood without drug use, and a potentially supportive religious background. While some factors like the lack of drug use in the past four years might mitigate risk, the presence of other indicators suggests moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
