    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly contribute to risk but might be considered in terms of any potential racial bias. She's been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which is low on the recidivism scale since being arrested without a conviction usually means she's managed to avoid longer sentences or more serious charges.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to risk factors; it's more about behavior than physical characteristics. She's never been married and lives alone, which might suggest she's not dealing with domestic issues, but that could also be a sign of stability. She's currently enrolled in school, so education is positive as it relates to job opportunities and self-improvement.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate higher responsibility or adaptability, but if she's been laid off or has inconsistent work, that might be a red flag. The fact that she used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) shows substance abuse history. Substance use can lead to legal issues, health problems, and potentially increased risk of recidivism.\n\nThe mention that some of the time during the past month she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up indicates she might be dealing with mental health issues or low self-esteem. This could contribute to risky behaviors like drug use or seeking help for these feelings, which isn't being provided here.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological dad in a household of four in an urban area suggests she's experienced family instability from a young age. This can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health, potentially increasing the risk of engaging in risky activities.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal life, which is generally associated with lower risk behavior compared to those who don't believe or have other religious factors involved.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, moderate substance use history, potential mental health issues from her emotional state, family background indicating possible instability, and no conviction. These factors might suggest she's at a medium risk but not extremely high. I'm leaning towards NO with low confidence because the lack of convictions and being in school are mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
