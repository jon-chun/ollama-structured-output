    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk factors analysis indicates a high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female from White background. Age might not be directly predictive here unless she's very young and showing signs of immaturity, but she hasn't been convicted yet, so that might lower the risk slightly.\n\nShe has only one arrest but no convictions. That suggests she's in custody less than others who have more serious charges. No prior convictions mean she may follow a safer path compared to those with more history.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'0\" and 180 lbs. While body type can be an indicator, without specific BMI calculations or health issues, it's hard to tell. Average weight might not directly correlate unless there's evidence of related health problems.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone is a neutral risk factor; some people are more cautious while others are fine with that. Without other risk indicators, this doesn't tip the scales towards high risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college: Lower education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because she might have fewer resources or opportunities to get back on track after release. But if she's actively seeking help, it could mitigate some risk.\n\nShe has 9 jobs in a year. That seems like a lot of work experience, which is generally positive for reintegration into society and stability.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine use but hasn't in the past four years except during the last month when she felt down. Short-term drug use might indicate occasional struggles with substance abuse rather than a chronic issue.\n\nFeeling down most of the time could point to mood issues or stressors, which are common in young adults. If it's temporary and manageable, maybe not a major risk factor on its own.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area suggests she was raised in a complex environment by multiple relatives. This might indicate family support but could also mean exposure to various influences that could be either positive or negative depending on the context.\n\nConsidering that God has an influence, this reflects her personal spirituality, which is unlikely to directly contribute to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues with mental health not mentioned here.\n\nPutting it all together: No prior convictions, stable employment history, moderate drug use (not chronic), and living situation in a supportive family. These factors lean towards lower risk but without more concerning indicators like multiple charges or violent behavior, the confidence level isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 9 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
