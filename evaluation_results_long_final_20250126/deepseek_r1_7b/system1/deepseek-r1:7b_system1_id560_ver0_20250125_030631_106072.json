    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from American Indian background. That might have some implications based on stereotypes about Indigenous populations and substance use or mental health issues. But I don't know enough to say if that makes him high risk yet.\n\nHe has two arrests and a conviction. Two prior convictions can be significant because it shows he's had legal trouble before, which could indicate unstable living situations or other underlying issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and weight 160 lbs. That doesn't immediately strike me as concerning unless there are health risks associated with his weight, but I don't have that information here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a red flag for various reasons like financial independence issues, lack of support networks, or potential isolation leading to mental health issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Being without a degree might affect his opportunities and could lead him into trouble if he's relying on other means for support, maybe substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can have negative consequences, including increased risk of substance use and mental health issues because of economic stressors.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years, and recent use during the past month when he felt down. Substance use is a strong indicator of potential for addiction, which can exacerbate other risks like violence or criminal behavior.\n\nHe feels so low that nothing cheers him up, indicating possible depression or a lack of hope, both of which are serious mental health issues with high risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household of four with his biological parents in an urban area. That might suggest living conditions that could be stressful, maybe not conducive to a healthy lifestyle and could contribute to behavioral issues as he gets older.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life, which is actually protective rather than risk-inducing. It suggests a sense of purpose or belief system that can help manage stressors.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions, substance use (marijuana), recent feelings of low mood, living in an urban household with four people, and being without a high school diploma. These factors point towards potential substance abuse issues, possible mental health problems, and unstable personal circumstances which are all high-risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
