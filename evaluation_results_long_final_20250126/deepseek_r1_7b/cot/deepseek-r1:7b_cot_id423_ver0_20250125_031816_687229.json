    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query. The user is a 22-year-old male with several factors that could influence his recidivism.\n\nFirst, his age of 22 is quite young, which might indicate he's still developing coping skills. That could be a red flag for him acting out or struggling with substance use now.\n\nHe has two prior convictions and has been arrested twice, so a history of criminal behavior definitely increases the risk. That's a strong indicator pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and not being enrolled in college could mean limited opportunities for positive development. This social disadvantage probably contributes to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's living alone without a family support system, which might leave him more vulnerable to negative influences and less emotional support when he's facing tough times. That's another high-risk factor.\n\nUsing drugs, especially marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, along with recent feelings of low mood, suggests substance abuse issues. Substance use often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can impede personal growth and lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four, living under his biological father's influence could introduce family dynamics that aren't conducive to positive development. This environment might have left him at a higher risk for certain behaviors or emotional struggles that could manifest now.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral guidance but doesn't necessarily protect against substance abuse or other negative influences. It\u2019s more of a personal factor than a mitigating one.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor points towards high risk. The recidivism prediction is solidly in the positive territory, and I'm confident enough to assign a confidence score around 80%. This person likely has multiple pathways leading back into trouble, so interventions should be comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is relatively young.
