Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is White, age 22, with three prior arrests and convictions. That's a solid foundation for recidivism risk\u2014higher chance she's been in trouble before.\n\nHer height and weight aren't immediately concerning, but maybe I should consider if she has issues related to her body type that might affect self-esteem or substance use. She's not married and isn't living alone, which could impact her support system, possibly making her more susceptible to isolation leading to relapse.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers can contribute to substance abuse and unstable relationships as alternatives are available.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year\u2014some work experience is positive, but if it's inconsistent, it might signal underlying issues that could lead to more problems.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent substance use is concerning because it can impair judgment and increase risk of relapse. Her recent feelings of low mood affecting her ability to cope with stress or maintain relationships adds to this.\n\nLiving situation at a young age with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That might indicate family dynamics issues, possibly leading to dependency or emotional instability that could carry over into adulthood and affect decision-making.\n\nHer spirituality believing in God's role is positive for personal well-being but maybe not directly relevant unless it affects her coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrests (high risk), substance use (high/medium?), education gaps (high), current living situation (maybe medium to high depending on support network), and recent drug use. The factors that point towards higher recidivism are the arrest history, lack of education, and drug use. The living with her mother might have its pros but could also be a con if it leads to dependency.\n\nI think the risk is pretty high. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested three times, which significantly increases her likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Her recent use of marijuana and cocaine, along with feelings of low mood, could impair her judgment and increase the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Her lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can leave her vulnerable to falling into criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 22 years old without a support network could lead to isolation, which is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use (past four years) can increase the likelihood of continued substance abuse, which is a leading cause of rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
