    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a complex task here. The user is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert, specifically focusing on rearrest recidivism over three years for a specific individual. Let's break down the information provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White descent. She has two arrests but no convictions, which might indicate she's in a LOW risk category regarding conviction impact since she can still go to trial without being convicted. Her height and weight don't seem directly relevant here unless they hint at physical aspects like strength or agility, but I don't see any info suggesting that.\n\nShe's living alone, single, so that's a factor. Living with family can provide support and resources which might reduce recidivism risk. She has a high school diploma and is in college, so her education level could be favorable for getting better job opportunities or skills, thus reducing the risk of reoffending.\n\nShe's worked two jobs during the year; having some income stability usually helps individuals avoid financial stress that can lead to substance use or other risky behaviors. Her drug use history is past four years with marijuana and cocaine\u2014this is concerning but not recent. The fact that she feels down most of the time might contribute to substance abuse, which could increase risk.\n\nHer background: she lived in a household of four at a young age in a rural area. This could imply she experienced a lot of stress or neglect, possibly leading to behavioral issues. She denies the role of God in her life, which might indicate a lack of support system or religious guidance that could influence her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The low number of arrests and education suggest she's on track for better outcomes. Living alone might offer some stability. Her job history is positive. However, her drug use and emotional state are concerning. Her past family environment adds complexity but may indicate potential vulnerabilities.\n\nI need to weigh each factor against others. The factors that point towards low risk include her education, job experience, and living situation. Factors like drug use and current emotional state could tip it towards a higher risk. Considering all these elements, I would lean towards a MEDIUM confidence level for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"Having two arrests but no convictions suggests that she is not currently in a high-risk group based on prior legal actions.

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
