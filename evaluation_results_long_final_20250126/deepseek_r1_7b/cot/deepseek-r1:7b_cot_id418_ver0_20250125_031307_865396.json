    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for a 20-year-old male Asian/Pacific Islander who has been arrested once but not convicted. He's 5'4\" and weighs 125-149 lbs, living alone, not married. He has a high school diploma, isn't in college, has held one job, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently. His household was size 8 when he was young, and he believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors that might influence rearrest recidivism. From what I know, things like prior convictions, age, socioeconomic status, living situation, education level, job experience, substance use, family background, and belief systems can play a role.\n\nHis prior arrest is one factor. He's been arrested once but not convicted, so maybe that's low risk since he hasn't actually received a conviction yet.\n\nHis weight might be around the lower end of normal, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism directly unless it's related to health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is a stable environment, which usually is associated with lower risk. He's not in a relationship and living alone often correlates with low risk factors like substance abuse.\n\nHe has a high school diploma; not attending college might mean he's more likely to seek job opportunities or further education, which could help him avoid recidivism if he turns things around.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Single job experience can be both positive and negative. On one hand, having some income stability might help. On the other, not much job experience could mean unstable circumstances leading to higher risk.\n\nSubstance use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it increases impulsive behaviors and can lead to more criminal acts or longer prison sentences, which may affect his ability to reintegrate after incarceration.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression might suggest some level of mental health stability, which could be a positive factor, but if he's using substances, that could counteract it.\n\nFamily size at 8 when young is quite large. Larger families can sometimes correlate with lower risk because there are more family members to support the individual and provide emotional support, reducing the likelihood of isolation or stressors at home.\n\nBelieving in God might suggest a higher level of moral support and adherence to values that could deter criminal behavior. However, it's also possible that his past substance use could be influenced by religion, but I think this is more about his personal motivation rather than risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (not convicted) is probably low. Living alone, high school diploma, single job experience are all positive and might contribute to a lower risk. However, the significant history of substance use could increase the risk despite these mitigating factors.\n\nThe household size in his youth might not directly impact current recidivism unless it's related to past instability, but he was living alone as an adult, so that factor is probably low.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the overall risk is medium. There are some mitigating factors like substance use, but it's not clear-cut.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"His single prior arrest with no conviction may suggest low recidivism risk as he hasn't faced legal consequences yet.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally associated with lower risk due to reduced stress and potential substance abuse issues.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not attending college may indicate some focus on job stability, which can be positive but depends on subsequent behavior.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"single_job_experience\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year could provide stability, yet limited experience might contribute to lower risk factors like substance use or instability.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine increases the risk of recidivism due to potential impulsive behavior or relapse.\",\n     \"high\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of 8 at a young age might have provided emotional support, contributing to lower risk despite past substance use.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God may offer some moral support but doesn't directly mitigate substance use risks.\",\n     \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
