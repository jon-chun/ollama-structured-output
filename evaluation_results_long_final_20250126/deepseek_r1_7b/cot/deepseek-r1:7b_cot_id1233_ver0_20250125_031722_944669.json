    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history but it's expunged. That might not directly impact her risk since she hasn't been convicted yet. It could be a mitigating factor because her past legal issues are behind her.\n\nHer weight is 5ft6in and 190 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone are significant here without additional context, so maybe this factor has low weight.\n\nShe's not married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might help reduce risk, so possibly a low impact.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so her lack of education could be a medium factor.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment stability usually reduces recidivism, but having only one job might mean she's underemployed or facing challenges, so maybe low impact.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years and some bad feelings affecting her mood. Drug use is a strong risk factor because of potential substance abuse issues, so this could be high. Her mood suggests she might struggle with mental health, which ties into substance use.\n\nShe lived in a household of two with her biological mother in an urban area from a young age. Growing up in an environment that might have stress or neglect can increase recidivism risk, so medium here.\n\nConsidering her religious beliefs, while not directly related to criminal behavior, she's seeking God for guidance, which could be positive but isn't a mitigating factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use and living situation are high factors. Employment and education are moderate negatives. No significant positives. So overall risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history (expunged)\", \"low\", \"Her criminal history, though present, has been expunged, which may indicate that she no longer faces a direct legal risk from past behavior]),\n    (\"weight (5ft6in, 190lbs)\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone do not directly correlate with recidivism without additional context about her health or lifestyle)),\n    (\"living situation (not married, living alone)\", \"low\", \"Living independently may provide some stability, which could potentially lower risk factors but does not strongly indicate a high risk]),\n    (\"education level (no high school diploma/GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is often associated with higher recidivism rates, as individuals may turn to other forms of support or face barriers in reintegrating into society)),\n    (\"employment (held 1 job during the year)\", \"low\", \"Having one job suggests some level of stability and economic independence, which can reduce recidivism risk but does not guarantee a positive outcome if the job is unstable or underutilized)),\n    (\"drug use (no drugs in past four years; felt low mood recently)\", \"high\", \"Stable drug use, especially with recent negative feelings, could indicate potential substance abuse issues that may contribute to criminal behavior or relapse)),\n    (\"household environment (small household, urban area from young age)\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a small household in an urban area could expose her to environmental factors that may influence behavior and decision-making over time)),\n    (\"religious affiliation ( God has something to do with her personal life)\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide guidance and support, but they do not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there is evidence of belief influencing actions)\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
