    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of two arrests and one conviction. That seems significant because more convictions typically correlate with higher recidivism rates. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 210 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism, but without knowing his BMI or other health metrics, it's hard to say. Maybe not the most impactful factor here.\n\n living alone could be relevant because isolation might contribute to substance use or other issues leading to more arrests. So that might be medium risk.\n\nHe has no high school diploma and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase stress, which might push him toward criminal behavior. That's probably a high factor.\n\nHe's employed two jobs in the past year. Having some employment is positive as it can provide stability, but only two jobs at 22 seems low; maybe he's underemployed or struggling, which could be negative. But I'm not sure if that's enough to tip it up.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana specifically) might indicate potential substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to more impulsive behavior or legal consequences beyond drug use, like accidents or other offenses.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed last month. If he had depression, it could be a coping mechanism for stress related to his criminal history. But since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe that's less of an issue. So probably medium impact.\n\nYouthful living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests exposure to family environment and possibly community factors. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or social issues that might contribute to recidivism. That could be high risk due to the environment.\n\nBelieving in God might indicate religious support, which is generally protective against recidivism as it can provide moral guidance and support during tough times. So this factor would lower the risk, maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests (high), lack of education (high), drug use (medium), living situation (high), and belief in God (low). The high factors are stronger than the medium ones. So overall, he's at a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two prior convictions\", \"high\", \"Having two prior arrests and a conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism due to established criminal behavior and possible underlying issues such as substance abuse or family dysfunction.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities, create stress, and potentially lead to further involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana) past four years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use may indicate potential substance abuse issues which could contribute to impulsive behavior or legal consequences beyond drug-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living independently can provide a sense of stability but may also isolate an individual, potentially exacerbating stressors and substance use \"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Religious belief often provides moral support and guidance which can help deter criminal behavior and provide comfort during challenging times.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
