    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. So, we have a 22-year-old male who is White, arrested once but not convicted, living alone, with a GED, no college enrollment, two jobs, drug use in the past four years, some recent feelings of low mood, a tough childhood living with both parents in a big household, and he believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each factor to assess their risk level. \n\n1. **Arrest Record**: He's been arrested once but not convicted. Since it's white-collar crime, which is less severe than criminal offense, this might be low. But maybe the non-conviction could indicate a lack of motivation.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: Past four years he used marijuana and felt down recently. Recurrent substance use can increase recidivism, so high risk here.\n\n3. **Mood State**: Recent feelings of low mood. This could affect his motivation to get involved in trouble again; maybe medium but could push towards high if it's a consistent issue.\n\n4. **Family History**: Childhood with both parents in a large household. Could indicate more supervision or perhaps lack thereof, but I'm not sure how that affects risk directly.\n\n5. **Religious Belief**: He believes in God. Some studies suggest religious individuals may have lower recidivism rates due to moral accountability, so maybe this lowers the risk.\n\n6. **Employment**: No college and only two jobs. Unstable employment can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors; could be medium but maybe high if he's under employable age.\n\n7. **Living Alone**: Living solo with no support network, which is a red flag for higher recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use and recent mood issues are strong indicators of high risk. The arrest record might not be as significant unless it's tied to serious offenses. Living alone adds to the risk factors. While religious belief could somewhat mitigate, the other factors seem too influential.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a non-convicted arrest, which might indicate limited motivation or potential for re-arrest despite minor offenses like white-collar crimes.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana use and recent feelings of low mood can significantly increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood State\", \"medium-high\", \"Recent feelings of low mood might indicate potential for decreased motivation, but it could also suggest ongoing issues that could escalate behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of size 10 may provide some level of stability or supervision, which could somewhat mitigate risk factors related to family dynamics.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God might offer a sense of moral accountability that could reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors compared to non-religious individuals.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no college education and only two jobs during the year suggests possible instability or financial pressures that could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase isolation, potentially leading to increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug use or seeking out negative social circles.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 202 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 10. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
