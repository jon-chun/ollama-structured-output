    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking for a risk assessment on a 19-year-old male with several factors. I need to break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I'm not sure if that plays into it much here since he's just 19 and has a clean record. Probably low risk because younger individuals often have better outcomes.\n\nHe's been convicted once before, but only one offense. That might still be considered low to medium risk. Recidivism typically doesn't drop off so quickly unless there are significant changes in his situation.\n\nHeight is 6'0\", weight 190 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics directly affect risk assessment much without medical issues or other factors, so maybe low.\n\nLiving alone might indicate some independence, but it's also a risk factor for isolation and potential stressors. So medium risk there.\n\nNo marriage and living alone again points to similar reasons as above\u2014maybe less support network which could be a risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment suggest he has some education and future goals, so probably low risk.\n\nTwo job roles during the year\u2014not a lot of experience working but also not a bad sign. Maybe medium risk because having jobs is good but limited roles might mean less stability.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014he used marijuana before. That's a red flag for substance abuse which can impact behavior and decision-making. Definitely high risk here.\n\nNo recent depression over the past month, so that's a positive indicator\u2014maybe lower risk there.\n\nHe lived with both parents as a child in a household of four in a rural area. Being raised by extended family might have its pros (more support) but also cons like potential neglect or family dynamics issues. Could be medium to high risk depending on the environment.\n\nBelieves in God, so religious involvement. Some people find that a protective factor, especially if it's a strong belief and helps with decision-making. So maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting all this together: one conviction (medium), limited job experience (medium), substance use (high). The rest are either positive or neutral. Substance use is a major red flag here. Even though he's young and has good education, the past drug use might tip it towards high risk. So my prediction would lean towards high risk with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which could indicate a history of substance abuse or other negative behaviors that may impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job experience\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the past year suggests some level of stability and responsibility, which may correlate with lower rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant risk factor for substance abuse, which can lead to unstable behavior and increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents at a young age in a rural household could indicate potential family dysfunction or neglect, which may contribute to higher rearrest risk if not addressed.'),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide a sense of stability and moral guidance, which can positively influence decision-making and behavior over time.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
