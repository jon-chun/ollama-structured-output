    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female and predict her rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with four arrests and prior convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivists with multiple past offenses are usually high risk because they're more likely to re-offend. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe weighs between 150-174 lbs at 5'4\", which is on the lower side of the BMI scale (around 23). Her weight could be a concern, but since she's an adult and hasn't made lifestyle changes, maybe it's not too impactful. Or perhaps it's not relevant here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence her social support system. While living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher crime rates, relying on fewer people for support might affect her decision-making in risky situations. I'm leaning towards medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a big factor in recidivism. People without education often have less stable jobs and fewer opportunities, which can lead to substance abuse issues. This seems like a high risk factor because lack of education increases the chances of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment stability is another key point. Having at least some income can help with financial management, reduce stress, and provide social ties. One job might be enough for basic needs but could also be insufficient if she's struggling or facing instability. Maybe medium risk here since a job exists but it's limited.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism. She hasn't used drugs recently except during a bad mood, which might indicate temporary withdrawal rather than ongoing issues. However, past use can still increase the risk of relapse or further substance-related issues that could contribute to crime.\n\nHer recent feelings are so low she feels nothing can cheer her up. That's concerning. Persistent low mood and lack of engagement in activities could lead to disengagement from life, which is a risk factor for criminal behavior. This seems like high risk because it indicates potential substance abuse or other behavioral issues that might escalate into further crime.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological father in a household of four. Coming from a difficult home environment can have long-term effects on mental health and behavior. Larger households often provide more supervision, so this might actually be a lower to medium risk factor because she has some support, but the challenging environment could increase issues.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with her life. This indicates spiritual alienation or lack of religious support, which can contribute to self-destructive behaviors and higher risk of engaging in risky activities. It's a strong indicator of potential behavioral issues, so high risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), no education (high), recent drug use but temporary (medium), living situation with limited support (medium), persistent low mood (high), and spiritual alienation (high). The factors are mostly high or medium. Considering these, the prediction is likely high risk for rearrest within three years.\n\nConfidence level would be quite high because most of the factors point towards significant recidivism. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and prior convictions, which strongly indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college increases the chances of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Recent Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, though mostly recent, can still contribute to potential behavioral issues or substance abuse, which may escalate into further crime.\"), \n    (\"Persistent Low Mood and Disengagement\", \"high\", \"Feeling so down that nothing can cheer her up indicates possible disengagement from life and potential for behavioral issues, increasing the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Difficult Home Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological father in a household of four, especially at a young age, could provide some support but may also contribute to behavioral challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
