    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 19-year-old Hispanic male with a history of two arrests but no convictions. He's married living with his spouse, has a high school diploma, no college enrollment, no job experience in the past year, drug use (marijuana) from the past four years, hasn't felt depressed in the last month, had a household of six at a young age in an urban area, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, let's break down each risk factor. His lack of convictions despite arrests might indicate prior non-violent offenses but no criminal history yet. Being 19 is still relatively young; perhaps he has more time to turn things around.\n\nMarried and living with his spouse suggests a stable home environment, which could be positive for his behavior. No job experience in the past year might mean he's focused on school or other activities. High school diploma but not college enrollment \u2013 maybe limited opportunities for reintegration into society once released.\n\nDrug use is a red flag. Even if it's marijuana, frequent drug use can lead to unstable mental state and increased risk of recidivism. No depression in the past month might be confusing; could mean he's managing well or maybe substance abuse is masking other issues.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area \u2013 that's a family environment but also potentially influenced by living in a high-stress urban setting, especially if there were disciplinary issues before. Believing in God shows a strong moral compass which might help in making good decisions.\n\nPutting this all together: the main factors are his drug use and lack of job experience. The low to medium risk is probably because he's young and has a stable family situation. But considering his drug history, I'm leaning towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (2)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of arrests but no convictions, which could indicate potential for future criminal behavior if not addressed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Household Size (5ft9in, household size 6 in urban area)\", \"low\", \"Living with his spouse in an urban area suggests a stable environment, potentially reducing risk factors compared to other settings.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (High school diploma, not enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and limited higher education could limit opportunities for positive reintegration but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience (No jobs in the past year)\", \"low\", \"Lack of job experience may indicate focus on education or other activities, reducing direct risk factors associated with employment and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in past four years)\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use, particularly marijuana, can contribute to unstable mental health and increased risk of criminal behavior if not managed properly.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (No depression felt in the last month)\", \"low\", \"Stability in mental health may suggest effective management of substance abuse issues, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family History (Lived with both parents at young age in urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Exposure to a household environment that included both parents could influence behavior and decision-making, especially if there were disciplinary issues previously.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (Believes God has something to do with his personal life)\", \"low\", \"Strong religious belief may provide guidance and support for ethical decision-making, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
