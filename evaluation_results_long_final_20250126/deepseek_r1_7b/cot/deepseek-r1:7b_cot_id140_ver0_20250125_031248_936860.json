    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times with prior convictions\u2014each arrest is a red flag because it shows a history of trouble lawfully. That should be a high weight.\n\nHe's only 5'7\" and 154 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, which I don't know about here. So probably low.\n\nLiving alone can mean less support network, but if he has someone close, maybe not so much. Since he doesn't have any dependents mentioned, maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014his education level is below par. Lower education often correlates with more crime and recidivism, so that's a high factor.\n\nHe's worked two jobs in the past year. Maybe working gives some stability, but if it's minimal, perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana before four years and recently felt down. Drug abuse can lead to other issues and higher risk of further crimes or substance use problems, which could increase recidivism. High weight here.\n\nHe lived in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age. That's a tough start; family environment can influence behavior. Maybe medium because it's not the worst but still concerning.\n\nBelieving in God for personal issues\u2014he might have mental health issues, which could affect his ability to reintegrate and commit crimes again. Medium risk here as it's significant but maybe not the top factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are the prior convictions (high), drug use (high), lack of education (high). Medium factors include living situation and belief in God. Medium factors like age, weight, living alone.\n\nSo overall, this person seems to have multiple high risk factors that point towards a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which is strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent substance abuse, particularly marijuana, can lead to increased risk of criminal behavior or further substance issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED correlates with higher levels of criminal activity and lower chances of reintegration into society.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, potentially increasing the risk of isolation and subsequent criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with a large family at a young age may indicate family dysfunction which could influence future behavior and risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God for personal issues might indicate underlying mental health challenges that can affect decision-making and reintegration efforts.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
