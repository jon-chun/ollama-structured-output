    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a risk assessment task for a 21-year-old male. Let's break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is relatively young, but he's been arrested once without conviction. That one arrest could be significant, especially in a short time frame. Since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact isn't as severe yet.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic, but I don't think that directly affects his risk unless there are specific demographic factors at play here. Maybe not for this case.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'9\" and 215 lbs. This makes him somewhat athletic or muscular, which might influence behavior, but without more info on past behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nNever married and living with someone who isn't alone\u2014maybe that's a shared environment where stress could be higher or lower? Not sure yet.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college: Indicates some level of education, which might correlate with lower recidivism if he's making stable choices. But without knowing his motivation for getting into trouble again, it's tricky.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014some stability there could be positive, but maybe he was laid off or facing challenges that led to his arrest.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression: These are good signs; substance abuse can be a major driver of recidivism, as well as mental health issues. So this is a negative factor for risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area since a young age\u2014foster care or family environment? Urban areas might have different social contexts and higher stressors which could influence behavior.\n\nHe believes in God: That's a positive psychological factor, which can aid in personal motivation towards better choices. However, belief systems don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can affect self-perception.\n\nPutting this all together, his lack of prior convictions is a mitigating factor, but the arrest still counts as a negative. His stable job and no drug use are positives that lower risk. The urban environment could be contributing stressors or influences, but without specific data on how it affects him, it's hard to assign high weight.\n\nConsidering all factors, his risk of rearrest seems low compared to someone with more significant issues like multiple convictions or a history of substance abuse and mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may indicate a younger decision-making capacity.
