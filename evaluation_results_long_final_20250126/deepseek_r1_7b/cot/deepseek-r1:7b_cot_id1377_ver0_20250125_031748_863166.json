    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where someone is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to evaluate the recidivism risk for a 21-year-old female based on several factors over three years. The user provided detailed information about her background and wants a JSON response with each factor's weight, prediction, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each of her risk factors one by one. Let me start with her age. She's 21, which is relatively young, so maybe that lowers the risk compared to older individuals who might have more life experience leading to more crimes.\n\nNext, her race is mixed, but since it's not specified as a minority group, I think this might be less of a factor. Maybe race doesn't play as big a role here unless there's specific data indicating otherwise.\n\nShe has two arrests and one conviction. That's a significant point because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future crimes or reoffending. So her arrest history is definitely a high risk factor, especially since it's only two times but already leading to a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; they might be red herrings unless there's some indicator that relates body metrics to recidivism, which I'm not aware of in this context.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability from a supportive home environment is usually positive for reintegration into society, so maybe this factor lowers the risk compared to someone who's homeless or alone.\n\nNot having a high school diploma and not going to college could be a red flag. Lack of education can lead to lower job opportunities and more involvement in criminal activities. So her educational background is another high risk factor.\n\nShe only held one job during the year, which might indicate she's either underemployed or has struggled to find stable employment. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates because individuals might turn to illegal activities as a means of survival.\n\nHer substance use history\u2014specifically cocaine\u2014and her recent feelings of low mood could be concerning. Drug abuse is a major driver of criminal behavior and can lead to impulsive actions that result in more crimes or longer sentences, which would increase the risk.\n\nShe mentions feeling down for most of the past month without any positive triggers. This persistent negative state might affect her ability to function positively in society, making it harder for her to reintegrate successfully and possibly leading to more criminal behavior.\n\nHer young age at living with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area suggests she may have experienced abuse or neglect, which are serious issues that can permanently increase the risk of recidivism. Environmental stressors like that can have long-term effects on someone's ability to avoid criminal behavior later in life.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior convictions (high), lack of education and employment (both high), substance use (high), current emotional state (high), and past trauma (high). The low factors are her marriage and the relatively young age. However, considering the high impact of each risk factor, especially the prior convictions and current issues, I would lean towards a high risk.\n\nSo, weighing all these together, my prediction is that she has a high likelihood of being rearrested within three years. My confidence in this assessment is quite high because multiple significant risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 21 may lower her risk compared to older individuals who have more life experience that could lead to more crimes over time.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Mixed race may not be a significant factor unless specific data indicates otherwise, but it is generally less impactful than other factors like prior convictions and education.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending compared to individuals with no criminal history or fewer offenses.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse in a stable household may reduce her risk of reintegration into society and involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate, combined with not attending college, is a significant indicator of lower job opportunities and higher involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate underemployment or difficulty finding stable employment, which can correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use Disorder\", \"high\", \"Use of cocaine in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues, which are major drivers of criminal behavior and impulsive actions that result in more crimes or longer sentences.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for most of the past month without positive triggers indicates a negative emotional state that could affect her ability to function positively in society and reintegrate successfully, potentially leading to more criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area at a young age suggests possible exposure to abuse or neglect, which are serious issues that can permanently increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Stability\", \"low\", \"Stability from living with a supportive spouse may reduce her risk of experiencing high stress or instability, which could lead to more positive outcomes in reintegration and reduced criminal behavior over time.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
