    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down all her factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a GED but isn't in college. I know that having a GED can sometimes help with job opportunities, but it might not translate into higher earnings or better living situations as someone with a bachelor's degree. So maybe this is a medium factor against her.\n\nShe used drugs for the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is definitely a strong indicator of substance abuse problems. Substance abuse often leads to unstable personal situations, which can contribute to recidivism. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 139 lbs. Weight alone might not directly influence recidivism unless it's associated with other negative behaviors or living conditions. So maybe this is low.\n\nShe lives alone, hasn't been married, and has no children. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, but without more context on her living situation (like if she's sleeping rough or with someone), it's hard to say for sure. I'll go with medium here.\n\nShe has two job experiences during the year. Having some work experience is positive because it shows responsibility and ability to support herself. This should be a low factor.\n\nHer religious affiliation might influence her behavior, but it also depends on how she interacts in society. Since she considers God involved in her life, maybe she's a responsible individual? So perhaps this is a medium factor.\n\nShe felt very down during the past month and nothing could cheer her up. This indicates a lack of hope or engagement with her environment, which can lead to self-harm thoughts or behaviors. This seems like a high risk indicator.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. If it's a minor offense, maybe she's working on turning her life around. But if it's a serious crime, that would be bad. Since no conviction, I'll assume it's a cautionary offense and might be medium.\n\nPutting this all together: Medium factors from GED, living situation; high from drug use, low from two jobs, medium religion, high from low mood. Drug use is the strongest indicator here. So overall risk is probably high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"ged\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED can sometimes limit job opportunities and earning potential compared to a bachelor's degree, which might indicate lower financial stability and self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"past drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse often correlates with unstable personal situations and higher likelihood of recidivism due to impaired judgment or increased risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"two jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment generally indicates responsibility and ability to support oneself, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"low mood\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of despair may signal underlying issues like addiction, depression, or lack of engagement in personal activities, all of which can contribute to substance use and unstable living situations that increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"minor offense\", \"medium\", \"A single non-convicted arrest suggests potential for rehabilitation but could still impact confidence and self-esteem, indirectly affecting recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
