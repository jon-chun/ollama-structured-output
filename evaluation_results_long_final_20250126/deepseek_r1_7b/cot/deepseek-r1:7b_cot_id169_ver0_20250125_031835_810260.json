    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults are often seen as less likely to commit crimes again because they're still developing. So that's a low risk compared to older individuals who might have more life experience and potential for repeat offenses.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know there can be disparities in the criminal justice system based on race, but at this point, without specific data linking his race to recidivism rates among similarly aged individuals, it's hard to assign a high risk just based on that. So maybe medium or low? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nHe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. Repeated convictions are a big red flag because each time he gets caught, it can affect his future opportunities, like getting jobs or housing. Three times is significant; that's three separate offenses which could indicate problematic behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, weight 210 lbs. While physical characteristics aren't typically predictive of recidivism unless there's a history of body dysmorphia or eating disorders, there's no information here to suggest he has such issues. So this factor doesn't seem particularly high or medium risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors because it removes social support which can help prevent risky decisions. However, since he's a young adult without ties, maybe the risk isn't extremely high but perhaps on the medium side.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing college might indicate lower educational attainment, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to less knowledge of laws or better job opportunities.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide financial stability and reduce the need for illegal activities. Two jobs seem reasonable; I don't see a high risk here unless he's been inconsistent.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs, so maybe this factor alone doesn't add much risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the last month despite drug use. Lack of depression might suggest he's managing his substances well or has other coping mechanisms. This could lower the risk slightly compared to someone who felt depressed after drug use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a stable, supportive environment is usually protective against recidivism, but if there were issues in that household, it could be different. Without info on the living conditions' safety or any family dysfunction, I can't assign high risk here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. This might relate to his religious involvement or belief system which, while not directly linked to recidivism, could influence his behavior in positive or negative ways depending on context. Not a strong indicator for high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Repeated convictions (3 times) and no college enrollment are significant factors pointing towards medium to high risk. However, he's young, so maybe tempered by that. Drug use isn't severe, but his living situation might be a bit unstable since he's never married and living alone with four parents in an urban area.\n\nI think the main points are the three prior convictions, lack of education, and perhaps some indicators like living alone which could imply instability. So I would assign medium risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been convicted three times, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"With a high school diploma and no college enrollment, this may limit opportunities for positive development and employment.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age in an urban area suggests some level of stability, though it could also indicate potential challenges without a support network.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
