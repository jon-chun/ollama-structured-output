    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, being White doesn't inherently increase crime rates, but it's a sensitive topic and can sometimes be associated with systemic issues like mass incarceration. But since he's just White and hasn't been convicted yet, maybe this isn't as significant here.\n\nNext, he has one arrest but no conviction. That could mean he's at risk of getting convicted in the future, especially if he reoffenses.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 190 lbs. Weight alone doesn't predict recidivism much, so this might not be a high factor here.\n\nNot being married or living alone... Hmm, living arrangements can influence support systems, but since it's both factors are negatives in terms of support, maybe that slightly lowers the risk? Or maybe not enough to change the weight.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment. Education is usually protective against recidivism because it opens more opportunities. So this would probably have a low or medium weight.\n\nHe held one job last year. Employment can help with financial stability and reduce stress, so maybe slightly lowers the risk but not sure how much.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates because it increases risk-taking behaviors like drug-seeking or using more severe substances. This would have a high weight.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. Maybe he's motivated, but if he's struggling with substance abuse, depression might be tied to that. However, since he's not depressed now, maybe this is less relevant.\n\nHe lived in a household of four as an adult from a young age in an urban area. Growing up in a larger household can sometimes mean less supervision or more exposure to risk factors like drugs or crime, so this could have a medium weight.\n\nConsidering his faith, he thinks God has something to do with his life. Belief in a higher power can provide moral support and discipline, which might help reduce recidivism. So maybe slightly lowers the risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use is a strong red flag (high), living arrangements at a young age (medium), one prior arrest (medium), lack of motivation due to not feeling depressed (maybe low), and his background in a larger household (medium). Education and job are protective, but maybe not enough to offset the high factors.\n\nSo overall, I think he's at a medium risk. Maybe 50% confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor, here is the structured response:\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- **Drug Use:** High - Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use significantly increase recidivism risk.\n- **Living Arrangements:** Medium - Living with four family members in an urban area at a young age may have influenced exposure to risk factors.\n- **Prior Arrest:** Medium - A single non-convicted arrest suggests potential for future criminal behavior.\n\n** protective Factors:**\n- **Education and Employment:** Low - High school diploma and college enrollment indicate positive influences, but only one job may not be sufficient.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed now doesn't directly correlate with past issues affecting recidivism.\n- **Cultural Background:** Being White isn't inherently a risk factor without specific systemic context.\n\n**Prediction:** NO\n**Confidence:** 50%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living with four family members in an urban area at a young age may have influenced exposure to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single non-convicted arrest suggests potential for future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
