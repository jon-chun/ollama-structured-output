    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 20-year-old Black male. He's been arrested twice but not convicted, which might be a red flag because sometimes when someone is arrested multiple times without getting a conviction, they can end up reoffending or having higher risk factors later on.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I'm not sure how that relates to recidivism directly, but maybe weight could be a factor in terms of substance abuse? But he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that might lower his risk there.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which is interesting because sometimes people who are living alone can have higher levels of stress or depression. Wait, actually, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so maybe that's not a factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, but I'm not sure how education level affects recidivism. Maybe lower education could be linked to more substance abuse or less support system?\n\nHe held one job during the year, which might indicate he's somewhat stable, but maybe only one job is not enough for long-term stability.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't directly impact risk assessment, so I can probably ignore that unless it relates to other factors like motivation to change.\n\nHe lived in a household of three in an urban area when young. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and different social dynamics which might contribute to higher recidivism if he was exposed to negative influences before.\n\nPutting this all together: two prior arrests, living alone, no drug use, no depression, one job, but raised in an urban environment where he lived with a household of three. The lack of education (high school diploma) and no college enrollment might not be directly linked, but maybe being arrested twice could indicate past issues that lead to higher risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium risk because of the two prior arrests without convictions, living alone, and the urban environment where he lived when young might have exposed him to negative influences. His lack of drug use and no recent depression are positive factors that might lower the risk a bit, but the other factors still point towards medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has two prior arrests without convictions, which could indicate past issues leading to potential higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest some level of independence and lower risk compared to living with others, though this factor's impact is mitigated by other considerations.\"),\n    (\"Urban Environment Exposure\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a household of three at a young age could expose the individual to negative influences commonly found in such environments.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```",
