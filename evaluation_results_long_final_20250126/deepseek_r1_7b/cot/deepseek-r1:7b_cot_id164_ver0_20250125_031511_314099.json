    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults can be more prone to making impulsive decisions or getting involved in criminal activities because they're still developing their decision-making skills. So that might be a low to medium risk factor since he's relatively young and the risk might not be too high yet.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a direct indicator of recidivism unless there are systemic issues at play, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe this isn't a significant factor in his case.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. So this should be a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'3\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics are typically considered in recidivism assessments, so this might not have much impact here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he has a high school diploma and is attending college, he likely has some resources and maybe a stable environment. So maybe low risk from this factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and isn't feeling depressed recently. These are positive factors that indicate good mental health and substance abuse prevention, which can lower recidivism risk. So probably medium to low here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. While living with family can provide support, urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates or stressors. However, since he's attending college and has a stable situation now, the impact might be mitigated.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a positive factor related to moral support and personal well-being. That likely contributes to lower recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), living situation (low), but other factors like education, substance abuse, and family living (medium). The high prior conviction might outweigh the other mitigating factors. So maybe his overall risk is medium to high.\n\nWait, but I should consider that prior convictions can have a strong influence on recidivism regardless of other factors. Even with good mental health and education, one prior arrest could significantly increase the chance of rearrest. So perhaps it's better to lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults may be more prone to impulsive decisions, but this is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk as they are still developing their decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can have systemic implications, it is not directly indicated here and thus does not significantly influence the risk assessment in this case.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction increase the likelihood of future offenses due to possible impulsivity or unresolved issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher stress, but combined with education and substance abuse prevention, it mitigates risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression or drug use suggests positive mental health indicators that could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with family in an urban area may have some challenges, but attending college indicates a stable environment and resources.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Moral support from religious belief can contribute positively to well-being and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
