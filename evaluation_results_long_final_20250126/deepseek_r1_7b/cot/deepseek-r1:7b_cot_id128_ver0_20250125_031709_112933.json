    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to each risk factor for this 20-year-old male. Let me start by going through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to various social and economic factors, but as of recent data, the racial disparity has been narrowing. However, it still might have a low to medium weight because it's not the most significant factor compared to others like substance use or living circumstances.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a clear history of criminal behavior; this should be high risk since prior convictions are strong indicators of future involvement in the legal system.\n\nHis height is 5'11\", but I don't see how that directly affects recidivism unless it's related to physical labor or something, which isn\u2019t indicated here. So maybe low weight because it\u2019s not a direct factor.\n\nHe weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct risk factor for rearrest unless it relates to health issues, but he hasn't felt depressed recently and I don't see any information about his health affecting his re-arrest rates. So probably low weight.\n\nNever been married and living alone\u2014being single can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism because there's no one to provide support or supervision, so this might be medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is in college\u2014that\u2019s post-graduation, which usually reduces future risk compared to someone without education. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe's held two jobs\u2014recently employed and stable\u2014usually indicates good life skills, so maybe lower risk, perhaps medium if the job was unstable or he changed frequently.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can increase recidivism because it might lead to substance abuse issues which could affect employment, family interactions, etc., so this is probably high risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently\u2014could indicate good mental health, but if he's been struggling before with depression due to substance use, maybe low weight? But since it's recent, perhaps medium or low. Not sure yet.\n\nYoung age and lived in a household of 4 with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014that could be a red flag because family support is important for avoiding criminal behavior. Urban environments sometimes have higher concentrations of crime and stressors that might contribute to recidivism. So this might be medium or high risk depending on the context.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014this suggests good moral values, so maybe low weight as it's a positive factor.\n\nNow, putting it all together: Prior conviction is high. Drug use is high. Urban environment could be medium. Others are lower. So when predicting 3-year rearrest, the high factors will likely push it towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior, making re-arrest more probable.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use history, particularly marijuana and cocaine, can lead to substance abuse issues that affect employment and relationships, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone_single_parent_household\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no support from a single parent household may strain family dynamics and increase stress, contributing to potential re-offending.\"),\n    (\"education_and_college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college demonstrates proactive steps towards betterment, reducing future criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"recently_held_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Employment history, even with two jobs in the past year, can indicate stability but may not directly correlate with recidivism risk without issues related to job performance or substance use.\"),\n    (\"family_background_urban_area\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a biological mother household may present additional stressors and exposure to crime environments, contributing moderate risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
