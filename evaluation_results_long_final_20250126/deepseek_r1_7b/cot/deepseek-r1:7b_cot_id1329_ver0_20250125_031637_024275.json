Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant red flag because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So that's high risk.\n\nHe's only 5'5\" and weighs 130 lbs. Weight isn't directly related to recidivism here unless there's underlying health issues, but the info doesn't mention anything about that. Maybe it's low risk in this context.\n\nLiving alone, never married\u2014being a single parent or not married can sometimes correlate with lower involvement in support systems, which might increase risk if he's struggling mentally.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers often lead to unstable situations, so that's medium risk.\n\nHe's worked two jobs during the year\u2014two jobs usually provide some financial stability, so maybe this is low risk because of the support it provides.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically felt down in the past month. That's a bit inconsistent. Past use can be concerning, especially if it correlates with other negative behaviors. But recent use might be less significant unless it's linked to current behavior.\n\nHe experienced a tough childhood living with both parents in a household of nine in an urban area. That's extreme family dynamics which are usually bad for development and can lead to behavioral issues, so that's high risk.\n\nBelieving in God\u2014his spirituality is positive but doesn't directly impact recidivism unless it's influencing his support system or personal well-being, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (high), family environment (high), lack of education and employment stability (medium each). Drug use is somewhat concerning but not as high. So overall prediction might lean towards high risk with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of prior convictions, which strongly indicate a likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an extreme family environment with multiple household members can contribute to behavioral issues and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of educational attainment and limited employment may impact future stability, but is not directly tied to recidivism without additional context about skill development or employability training.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"While there has been some drug use in the past four years, recent instances may not be directly linked to current behavior unless it correlates with other negative factors like financial instability or mental health issues which are not mentioned.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
