    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. She's White, hasn't been married, isn't living alone, has a high school diploma but is in college, worked three jobs, used marijuana in the past four years, and hasn't felt depressed recently. She lived with her mom when young, in an urban area, and she believes in God.\n\nFirst, age: 20. Young adults can sometimes be more rebellious or have unstable lives, so that's a medium risk factor. Next, race: White is a bit of an anomaly because race doesn't directly cause crime but can influence treatment and opportunities, so maybe low to medium. Education-wise, high school diploma with college enrollment might indicate she's proactive, which could be a low risk.\n\nMarried? No. So that's not a factor here. Not living alone: Could mean she has support, maybe lower risk. Drug use: She used marijuana recently, but only for the past four years. Not feeling depressed now, so perhaps better mental health than some others. Past convictions count once\u2014so one offense isn't terrible.\n\nLiving with her mom in a small household urban area might have its challenges but also provide stability. Believing in God could offer support and a sense of direction. \n\nPutting it all together: The factors don't seem to stack up high on negative risk markers. She's got some positive aspects like education, no marriage, living with family, and recent low drug use. So maybe the overall risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which is typically associated with emerging behaviors and challenges that can sometimes lead to instability or rebellion, but this age itself does not inherently indicate a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race does not cause crime, White individuals may face systemic barriers in certain areas such as employment and housing, which could potentially influence recidivism rates indirectly.
