    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me break down all her factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. So, that's a low risk compared to someone with more serious convictions. She's got some criminal history, though\u2014three arrests\u2014but since they're not convictions, maybe the weight is lower than someone with more severe offenses.\n\nHer age being 19 might be an advantage because she's still developing skills and life experiences. But her criminal history could offset that a bit.\n\nShe weighs 162 lbs at 5'6\". That doesn't immediately ring any bells in terms of weight as a risk factor, but maybe it's just part of her profile without specific implications for recidivism.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014so she has support networks. Maybe less likely to have issues with isolation or substance use, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That\u2019s concerning because education is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having any formal education can lead to poor decision-making and higher chances of reoffending.\n\nShe has held three jobs over the past year, which suggests she's been employed but maybe not very stable. Job instability might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors as a way to cope.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014could be problematic. Drug use can lead to strained relationships, substance abuse, and increased risk of recidivism itself if she continues to use drugs.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is interesting. Some substance users experience depression as a withdrawal symptom, so this might indicate better mental health, which could be positive but not sure how it ties into rearrest specifically.\n\nFrom a young age, living with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014this could have both pros and cons. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but might also mean exposure to higher crime or stressors that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which might affect her personal motivations and decision-making. Without religious guidance, she might make impulsive decisions that could lead to further issues.\n\nPutting this all together: three non-convicted arrests, some support factors like not being married and living with family, but also significant risk factors like lack of education, drug use, job instability, and no religious belief. The education is a strong negative because it's a key factor in reducing recidivism.\n\nI think the weightings would lean towards medium high overall. The non-convicted arrests are low, but her lack of education and job history could be around medium. The drug use might bring it up to high. She has support factors that mitigate some risk, so maybe not too high overall, but still, given the other factors.\n\nSo I'd predict a high relative weight for recidivism. Using a standard model where each factor contributes additively, with more significant negatives pulling the score higher.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each factor related to the 19-year-old Black female's background and circumstances:\n\n- **Three Non-Convicted Arrests**: Low risk compared to those with convictions but still a minor mitigating factor.\n- **Age of 19**: Potentially positive due to developing skills, offsetting by criminal history.\n- **No College or GED**: Strong negative indicator linked to lower recidivism rates.\n- **Three Jobs in Past Year**: Job instability could contribute to substance use and risky behaviors.\n- **Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)**: High risk factor as it can lead to strained relationships, substance abuse, and increased reoffending likelihood.\n- **No Depression in Past Month**: May indicate better mental health but not directly tied to recidivism.\n- **Living with Biological Mother in Urban Area**: Mixed implications regarding exposure to stressors or urban environments.\n- **No Religious Belief**: Could influence decision-making but doesn't directly correlate with higher risk.\n\nConsidering the significant negative factors (lack of education, job history, and drug use), her relative weight for rearrest recidivism is high. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Three non-convicted arrests\", \"low\", \"The three non-convicted arrests are a minor mitigating factor but do not significantly lower the risk compared to those with more serious convictions.\"),\n    (\"No college or GED\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is a significant negative indicator linked to higher recidivism rates and reduced opportunities for positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Three jobs in past year\", \"low\"|\"medium\", \"Holding three jobs shows some stability but could contribute to substance use and risky behaviors, which may slightly increase the risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana/cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is a high-risk factor associated with strained relationships, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"No depression in past month\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate better mental health but does not directly correlate with higher rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban living can offer opportunities but may also expose to stressors, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No religious belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief might influence decision-making but does not directly correlate with higher risk factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
