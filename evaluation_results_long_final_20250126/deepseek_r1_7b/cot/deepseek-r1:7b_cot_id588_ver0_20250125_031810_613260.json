    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested once but not convicted. He's a bit over 6 feet and weighs 210 lbs. He's living alone, never married, has a high school diploma, and is in college. He's worked five jobs, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, and felt really down recently. His early life was with his biological mother in an urban area when he was young, and he believes in God.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each risk factor step by step. Let's start with his criminal history. He has one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad on the surface, but since it's a misdemeanor, maybe there could be underlying issues that haven't been addressed. I'm thinking medium weight here because one arrest isn't terrible, but if it was a violent crime or if he's had other problems like drug use, it could go up.\n\nNext, his education level: high school diploma and attending college. Education is usually good for reducing recidivism, so maybe that lowers the risk. Low weight? Or perhaps not as strong because sometimes people with higher education might have better job opportunities or support systems.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be a positive factor since someone to help him if he gets in trouble. But it could also mean he has less support overall. I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and is 18, so he might still have some time ahead before making significant life decisions that could impact his behavior. Maybe low weight here since it's early in his life.\n\nDrug use is a big red flag. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with recent use feeling particularly bad. That suggests ongoing or relapsing substance abuse, which is a strong indicator of recidivism. High weight for this factor because drug use can lead to more impulsive behavior and has serious consequences.\n\nFeeling down a lot might indicate underlying mental health issues like depression. Depression often leads to substance abuse but could also be a sign that he needs help or has other personal struggles, which would lower the risk. Maybe medium weight here since while it's concerning, not everyone who feels this way is at high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHis early life in an urban household with his mother when young might have shaped his behavior. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and stressors, but without more info on that, I'm not sure how much weight to give it compared to other factors like drug use or education level.\n\nBelieving in God suggests he has a strong moral compass, which could positively influence his decisions. However, if there's nothing indicating otherwise, maybe this is a minor positive factor with low weight because it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless he's been influenced negatively by others.\n\nNow, putting all these together: one arrest (medium), education and living situation (low/medium), recent drug use (high), possible mental health issues (medium), early life circumstances (unknown but maybe medium), and religious belief (low). The high weight from drug use could significantly pull the prediction towards recidivism.\n\nI think overall, despite some mitigating factors like education and living alone, the recent drug use is a major risk. So I'd predict yes to rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one non-convicted arrest, which may indicate underlying issues that could affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest some educational support but do not necessarily mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone can provide some stability, but it also means less support network which could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana/cocaine use, especially if it's relapsing or leading to distress, significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may suggest potential mental health issues that could either help or hinder recovery efforts.\"),\n    (\"early life circumstances\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area at a young age may have influenced behavior, but without specific context on stressors, it's considered medium risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
