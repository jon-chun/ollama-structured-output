    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old. Young age can be a red flag because people are still developing their skills and might not have the same capacity to avoid getting into trouble again. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic issue, which isn't indicated. So maybe medium or low for now.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might mean he didn't take it seriously or perhaps got released on bail. That could be a medium risk because it doesn't confirm guilt, but it also shows he has some history of criminal behavior.\n\nStanding at 5'7\" and weighing 185 lbs\u2014probably athletic build\u2014but body weight isn't typically a direct indicator unless there's associated health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So low risk factor.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living with family might provide support, but living on his own could mean less supervision or fewer people to rely on if something happens. Medium risk because it doesn't guarantee independence from criminal influences.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can lead to engaging in risky behaviors and not having the skills needed for a stable life. High risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year\u2014some stability there is positive, but if he was working part-time or facing difficulties with them, it might indicate underlying issues. Medium risk because job history alone doesn't show much about his personal circumstances.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014he used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to various behaviors and might affect judgment. Medium risk since he's currently not feeling depressed, which could mean he's managing it well or maybe using it as a coping mechanism for stress.\n\nNot feeling depressed now despite drug use\u2014could indicate he's in control of his situation or perhaps he's dealing with other issues. Medium risk because the absence of depression doesn't negate past behavior.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in such a large household might mean more exposure to stressors, substance abuse, or criminal influences from a young age. High risk factor due to the environment and family dynamics.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events\u2014this could be a protective factor as it suggests he's finding meaning and possibly has a higher likelihood of making positive choices. Medium risk because while belief in God can help, it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior unless there are other factors at play.\n\nPutting all this together: High risk due to young age, prior arrest without conviction, lack of education, living alone, drug use, and family environment. Medium risk from being White, job history, and belief in God. So overall prediction is high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age (19 years) can indicate a higher potential for continued criminal behavior due to developmental stages.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No direct evidence suggesting systemic issues related to race which could impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"A single non-convicted arrest may show some criminal inclination but not definitively high risk.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living independently at an early age could indicate potential isolation and risk from influential environments.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education, including no high school diploma or GED, is a significant indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Two job holds during the year suggest some stability but do not directly correlate with future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use and current lack of depression could indicate ongoing substance issues affecting judgment.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of five at a young age, particularly in an urban area, suggests exposure to potential stressors and influences.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"While belief in God can be protective, it does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk without additional factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
