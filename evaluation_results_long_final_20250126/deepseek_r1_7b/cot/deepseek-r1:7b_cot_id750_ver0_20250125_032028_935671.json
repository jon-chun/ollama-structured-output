Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old White male with one arrest but not convicted. That seems like a minor offense, so maybe it's low risk. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nHis height and weight are unusual\u20146'2\" and over 250 lbs. I've heard that heavier individuals might have different recidivism rates, possibly higher? Maybe because of health issues or substance use. That could be a medium factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being in a relationship can reduce stress and strain, so this might increase risk\u2014so maybe high for living situation?\n\nHe has two job experiences. Having some work experience is good; it shows responsibility. So probably low here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. I'm not sure if drug use itself is a strong predictor unless there's dependence or use causing problems, which isn't clear here\u2014so maybe medium to low.\n\nReligion influence\u2014he believes God affects his life. Some factors like religious involvement can sometimes correlate with better outcomes, so this might be low risk.\n\nHe was in a household of four at an early age in an urban area. Growing up in a larger household might have had both positive and negative aspects\u2014could relate to family dynamics or exposure to issues.\n\nConsidering all these, the high factors seem to be his weight and living alone. The medium ones are drug use and religion influence. Maybe one low factor (arrest) but not enough to change the overall risk significantly.\n\nPutting it together: He has some moderate risk factors that might push him towards a higher risk score.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Weight\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 18 years old with a high weight (over 250 lbs), which may be associated with health risks or substance use issues that could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress and isolation, potentially raising the risk of recidivism due to behavioral or social factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) without recent negative effects may not strongly indicate a high risk but could be a mitigating factor if there were issues related to substance abuse causing problems.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"low\", \"Believing in God's influence on personal life can sometimes correlate with better outcomes, suggesting lower risk associated with religious involvement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs over 250 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
