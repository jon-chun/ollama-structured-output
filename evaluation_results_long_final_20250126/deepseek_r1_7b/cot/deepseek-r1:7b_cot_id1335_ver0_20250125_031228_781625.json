    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a first-time offender with one conviction. That might not be too bad on its own, but considering other factors, maybe it's less significant.\n\nHis height and weight aren't immediately concerning, but his living situation is quite unstable\u2014he's living alone without a partner. Unstable living conditions can often lead to substance abuse or other issues that increase recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't completed high school or has a GED, which puts him at a disadvantage in the job market. That can affect his ability to get support and might contribute to further issues.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, which is another indicator of instability. Unemployment for so long without seeking help could mean he hasn't engaged with any support services needed to turn things around.\n\nUsing marijuana past four years isn't too significant yet, but it shows some drug use history. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nLiving at a young age with eight people in the household is really concerning. That environment might have led to neglect or abuse, which can have long-term effects on his behavior and mental health.\n\nLastly, he acknowledges God as part of his life. That could be positive for moral support but isn't directly related to substance use or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards a higher risk\u2014unstable living, lack of education, unemployment, previous drug use (though not severe), and living in a large household which might indicate neglect. These seem like strong indicators of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to further crimes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"first-time offense with one conviction\", \"medium\", \"First-time offenses are generally less concerning, but when combined with other factors like living situation and education status, they can indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living alone without a partner\", \"high\", \"Living in isolation or without support from a partner can lead to increased stress, substance use, and potential abuse, all of which are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"), \n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"A lack of education can limit opportunities for positive change and may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug use or further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"only one job during the year\", \"high\", \" unemployment for an extended period without seeking support can lead to a lack of resources and increased risk of involvement in the criminal justice system.\"), \n    (\"use of marijuana in past four years, no recent depression\", \"low\", \"While substance use is a risk factor, not experiencing depression may indicate better mental health, which could mitigate some risks but does not eliminate them.\"),\n    (\"age at which he lived with biological mother in a household of eight\", \"high\", \"Living in a large household at a young age can lead to neglect or abuse, creating long-term behavioral and emotional issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"acknowledges God as part of life\", \"low\", \"Religious affiliation is generally a positive factor, but it does not directly address substance use or living conditions which are more significant risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
