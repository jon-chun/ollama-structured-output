Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not continuing education might mean he's less likely to get involved in another educational path that could prevent recidivism, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can have both immediate and long-term effects on behavior. The recent use during the past month might indicate more volatility or a higher relapse risk.\n\nHe's living alone with no support system. Living alone can isolate him, which might lead to increased stress or substance use issues, so that could be a medium factor pushing towards high risk.\n\nHe has two job experiences, which is better than not working at all but still low. Maybe some work experience can help in getting support or changing behavior, but it's not the strongest indicator.\n\nThe past home environment: he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area when young. That's a lot of people and an urban setting\u2014could mean more supervision initially but now living alone might create new stressors.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so his personal spirituality isn't providing any guidance or support against substance use or bad behavior. This could be a high risk factor because lack of spiritual support can lead to substance abuse issues.\n\nHis self-perception\u2014he considers God nothing for his personal matters\u2014might mean he's more likely to engage in risky behaviors without guidance. That's definitely a high factor pushing towards high risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and living alone with no support system, combined with lack of spiritual guidance, make me think this person is at higher risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"Not having a college degree might indicate less motivation to avoid criminal behavior through education or career goals.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can increase impulsive behavior and risk of reoffending, though recent use may slightly reduce this risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"no_support_system\", \"high\", \"No support system increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior and failing to seek help for substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"religion_factors\", \"high\", \"Not believing in God may lead to substance abuse issues and a lack of guidance against criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
