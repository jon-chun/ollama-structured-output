    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an18-year-old Hispanic male with one prior arrest and a conviction. That seems like a significant risk because prior convictions are directly linked to reoffending. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight 160 lbs, but I don't think those factors contribute much on their own. Maybe if he had health issues, but it doesn't say anything about that here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which might suggest he hasn't formed any support networks. Living alone can be a risk factor because there are fewer people to look out for him or help him if something happens. So medium-high risk.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is good because education often leads to better job prospects and stability. That lowers the risk compared to someone not studying.\n\nNo jobs during the past year means he might lack steady income or skills, making it harder to find employment upon release. High risk factor there.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine for four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential relapse and instability. Plus, he didn't feel depressed last month; sometimes drug use can lead to depression, but not always. Still, this is high risk because substance abuse often correlates with other criminal behaviors or mental health issues.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in an environment without supervision can expose him to negative influences, which increases the chance of engaging in risky behavior later on. High risk factor here.\n\nFinally, he believes God is involved in his life. While this could be seen as positive, sometimes religious belief might be linked to certain types of criminal behavior or lack of concern for others' well-being. However, it's a bit subjective and less directly related to recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, living alone, drug use, and unstable environment are strong indicators. While education is positive, the negative factors seem more influential.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"An prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as it demonstrates a history of criminal behavior that can lead to similar actions in the future.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone can reduce social support and may increase vulnerability to stressors, potentially leading to increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is strongly associated with potential substance abuse issues that can contribute to criminal behavior or other destabilizing factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school indicates a focus on positive outcomes such as obtaining education, which can lead to better job prospects and reduced risk of involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the past year can indicate instability or difficulty in securing employment post-release, both of which are significant barriers to reintegration into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household of four members at a young age may expose him to negative influences that could contribute to risk-taking behavior and increased likelihood of criminal involvement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
