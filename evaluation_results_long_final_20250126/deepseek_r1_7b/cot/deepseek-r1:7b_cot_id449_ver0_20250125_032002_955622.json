    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race directly affects risk assessment in most systems, but it might influence things like prior criminal history or access to resources. Since he has only been arrested once without a conviction, that's not a major issue here.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 2 inches and 170 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is for recidivism unless there's a reason to think about physical activity or something else, but it doesn't immediately strike me as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. That might indicate some social instability or lack of support system, which could increase the risk of reoffending if he experiences stress or lacks resources.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED can sometimes lead to limited opportunities, possibly resulting in higher recidivism rates compared to those with higher education who might have better job prospects and stability.\n\nHe's used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can definitely increase risk as it can impair judgment, relationships, and job performance. However, if he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's managed to stay sober enough to continue without major issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. That's a stable environment, but family living conditions can vary widely. Urban areas might have different risk factors compared to rural ones, like higher crime rates or more exposure to services that could aid in reintegration.\n\nHis religious belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events: This might suggest he doesn't seek spiritual guidance for personal issues, which isn't directly a risk factor but could influence how he copes with stress. Without religious support, he might rely on other mechanisms, which could be either positive or negative depending on the situation.\n\nPutting it all together: The most significant factors here are his drug use and not being in college. Drug use can have immediate detrimental effects and may lead to more impulsive behavior. His lack of a college degree could limit future opportunities, potentially leading to unstable situations where he might turn to further substance abuse or crime. While living with his mother isn't ideal, it's a stable environment compared to other factors.\n\nThe GED holder not in college might indicate lower self-esteem or motivation, which can contribute to risky behaviors. His past drug use adds to the risk of relapse or new substance abuse, which could increase rearrest chances.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think his risk is high because multiple factors point towards potential instability and increased likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Drug Use:** He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can impair judgment and increase the risk of relapse or new substance abuse, which could contribute to recidivism.\n\n2. **Education Level:** Having a GED but not enrolled in college might indicate lower self-esteem or motivation, potentially leading to risky behaviors that could result in reoffending.\n\n3. **Lack of College Education:** Limited post-secondary education can limit opportunities and may lead to unstable situations where he might engage in further risky behavior.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nGiven the factors\u2014drug use and limited educational pursuits\u2014the individual's risk assessment for rearrest recidivism is high due to potential instability, increased likelihood of relapse, or new substance abuse. The prediction leans towards YES with a confidence level of 75%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"His use of marijuana and cocaine increases the risk of relapse or new substance abuse, contributing to potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED Holder Not Enrolled in College\", \"high\", \"Lack of college education may lead to unstable situations and increased risky behavior, potentially resulting in reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
