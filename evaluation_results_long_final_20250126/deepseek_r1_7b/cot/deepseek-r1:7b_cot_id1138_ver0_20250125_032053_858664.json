    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the risk of this 20-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. From what I know, being Black can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased law enforcement. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. Without a conviction, it might not have significant legal consequences yet, so maybe medium risk here because the prior offense isn't severe enough on its own.\n\nHis weight is 5'10\"/169 lbs, which I think is within a healthy range for his height. No information suggests he's underweight or overweight, so probably low to no impact on recidivism from that factor.\n\nHe's single and living alone, so social support might be limited. While living alone can sometimes reduce stressors, it doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates unless there are other factors like lack of resources or community ties.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't working currently. Not being employed could lead to dependency issues, which might increase the risk of relapse into criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can have negative consequences on mental health and living situation, potentially increasing the risk.\n\nFamily background is a bit complex here. At a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. That's a large family environment, which might suggest more supervision but could also indicate higher stress or dependency issues that aren't directly tied to recidivism but affect his current stability.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral support and help in avoiding certain risky behaviors, so maybe this is a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High risk from race, medium from the single living situation, high from drug use and prior arrest without conviction. Employment issues also add to the risk. The family background doesn't directly contribute but might indirectly affect his stability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Being Black is associated with higher recidivism rates due to systemic factors like over-policing and biased enforcement, increasing the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest may not have significant legal consequences but can sometimes lead to monitoring or other risks that might influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher rearrest rates unless there are underlying dependency issues or lack of support networks which, in this case, is not specified as problematic.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Not working can lead to dependency issues and may increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors that could result in further criminal convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can have negative mental health consequences and potentially create a conducive environment for substance abuse which might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a large household suggests possible supervision but does not directly indicate high risk of recidivism unless there are other factors like stress or dependency issues which are not mentioned here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 169 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year.
