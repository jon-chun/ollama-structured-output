    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. I know there's some data suggesting that Black individuals have higher recidivism rates compared to White individuals. So that's a medium weight.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. An arrest without a conviction might still be significant because it could indicate past behavior issues or maybe he was released on bail after being caught again. That also points to medium risk.\n\nAge is 19, which isn't too old yet, but considering he's at this stage of life, it's possible he hasn't had much time to develop negative behaviors that might lead to recidivism. Still, one arrest could be a red flag. Medium weight here.\n\nHe's living alone with no children and never married. Living alone can sometimes mean he doesn't have support around him, which could contribute to substance use or other issues. But it's also possible he has the means and the desire to change. So medium risk.\n\nWeight is 180 lbs at 5'8\". That's a healthy weight for his height, so maybe no direct impact on recidivism from that factor. Probably low weight here.\n\nNo prior criminal history beyond one arrest. So nothing else there. Low weight.\n\nHe's in school now, which suggests he's focused on education and might be less likely to engage in risky behavior like drug use or illegal activities. That's a strong protective factor with high weight.\n\nHe held only one job during the past year. While having a job is positive, sometimes not being employed for an extended period can lead to dependency issues. But since he just had a job recently and is currently working, maybe that's less of a concern now. Medium.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned feeling low and down recently, so nothing this month. That might be a mitigating factor because he hasn't been using actively lately. High weight.\n\nLiving with his biological mother as a child, household size three in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could influence recidivism if the environment is unstable or there's exposure to negative influences. But since he's living with his mother now, maybe that stabilizes things. Medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. That suggests some level of spirituality and possible accountability, which can be protective against substance abuse. High weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Factors like the arrest, drug history, lack of support at home (if he's living alone), possibly not having a strong family network after being away from home as a child could contribute. But his age, being in school, and current job are positive signs that might outweigh some negatives.\n\nConsidering everything, I think the overall risk is medium but leaning towards low because of his current stable situation with education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals have higher recidivism rates compared to White individuals due to historical and systemic factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"An arrest but no conviction may indicate past behavior issues or potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 19, he has not had much time to develop negative behaviors that might lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes mean less support and potentially higher risk of substance use but here he is in school and employed which are positive signs.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"He used marijuana in the past four years, though recently he felt low and didn't use this month, which might mitigate risk.\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Mother\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment could influence recidivism but living with mother suggests a stable home environment.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Believes in God, which can be protective against substance abuse through accountability and spirituality.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
