    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White. From what I remember, there's some information suggesting that being White might be associated with a lower recidivism rate compared to other races in the US. So that could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. Since she's not convicted despite an arrest, maybe her criminal history isn't as significant here. So that would probably be a low risk factor too.\n\nHer height is 5'10\" and weight between 125-149 lbs. I don't know if body type correlates with recidivism much, but maybe she's in a good shape since her weight range isn't extremely high or low. So perhaps medium risk here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect self-esteem and support network, which might influence behavior. But not sure how strong that link is for rearrest. Maybe medium to low?\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level typically correlates with lower recidivism as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and less time spent in prison. So this could be low risk.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs in the past year. Job history is important; more stable employment usually reduces recidivism. Four jobs might indicate she has good work experience, so that would lean towards low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself can be a risk factor because of potential substance abuse issues or other behavioral problems. But her recent emotional state is positive, which might mitigate some risk. Maybe medium to high? Wait, she's using drugs, so that could increase risk despite her recent mood.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area at a young age. That sounds like a stressful environment with many siblings; maybe it contributed to some behavioral issues or higher risk of substance abuse. So this could be medium-high risk.\n\nLastly, she considers God to have something to do with her personal events. This might indicate a belief system that affects her behavior differently, perhaps more prosocially. Maybe it lowers the risk slightly, so low?\n\nNow, putting all these together: low (race), low (arrest), medium (body type), maybe medium or low (living situation), low (education), low (jobs), medium or high (drug use), medium (household), and low (religion). \n\nI think the main factors pulling her towards higher risk are drug use in the past, which is a strong indicator. Even though she recently didn't feel depressed, substance use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism. So overall, maybe high or medium.\n\nGiven that, I'll assign the prediction as \"YES\" with high confidence because of the drug use and living situation factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White individuals typically have lower recidivism rates compared to other racial groups in the US\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest may not significantly impact future recidivism risk if no prior convictions are present\"),\n    (\"Body Type\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight within a normal range may not strongly correlate with higher recidivism risk but can influence self-esteem indirectly\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone, especially in urban areas, might be associated with certain behaviors that could potentially increase risk, though this factor's impact is mitigated by recent positive emotional state\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and lack of college enrollment are typically associated with lower recidivism risk due to better job opportunities and support systems\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held four jobs in the past year suggests stable employment, which is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine can be a significant risk factor despite recent positive emotional state; substance abuse can lead to behavioral issues and self-harm\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with multiple siblings in an urban area at a young age may indicate past stressful experiences that could contribute to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God as a factor might suggest more prosocial behavior, which can lower recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
