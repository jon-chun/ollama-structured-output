    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 22-year-old Hispanic male. He has a history of 3 arrests and convictions, which immediately raises red flags because recidivism is often linked to past mistakes.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 160 lbs\u2014typical for someone his age. But weight isn't the main factor here; it's more about his behavior and circumstances.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone, which could mean he's in a relationship or has support from others. However, since he's not currently living with anyone, maybe there's some instability\u2014though it's not clear why that is.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college-bound suggests limited education, which can be a risk factor because education often correlates with lower recidivism rates when higher. Without a degree, he might have fewer opportunities for positive employment or relationships.\n\nHe held only one job in the past year, so his income stability is questionable. Unemployment or underemployment can lead to financial stress and possibly substance abuse issues, which isn't mentioned but could be inferred.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014this is a positive sign. Drug abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, especially among those with arrest history.\n\nHe's not feeling depressed over the past month; maybe he has better mental health or no current stressors. A lack of depression can sometimes indicate resilience, which is less risky.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two\u2014so he didn't have extended family support as a child. This could mean he didn't grow up with the same level of protection and resources that other kids might have had.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life suggests he's likely materialistic or doesn't rely on religion for guidance, which can sometimes be associated with risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: past criminal history (high), limited education (medium), unemployment (medium), lack of family support from youth (low to medium). The job stability and drug use are positive but don't outweigh the negatives. His mental health isn't an issue here, so that's a plus.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014three out of five high or medium factors\u2014the prediction is that he has a high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past criminal history\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 3 times and convicted.
