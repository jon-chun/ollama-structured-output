    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't think race is a significant factor in most risk assessments unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise, which isn't provided here. So maybe low weight on that.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's pretty light, so probably low weight. One offense might not be too concerning yet.\n\nHeight is 5'3\" and she weighs 155 lbs. Not sure how height affects recidivism; maybe it's irrelevant here.\n\nMarried living with her spouse\u2014being married in the context of living arrangements isn't a strong risk factor, so low weight.\n\nHigh school diploma not enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; sometimes having more education is associated with lower recidivism, but she has a high school diploma and no further education. Maybe medium weight because it's relevant but not directly a risk factor per se.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year\u2014job stability usually is good for reducing recidivism, so low weight here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to other issues, but she's not feeling depressed now, which might reduce that risk. Maybe medium weight since there's some history of substance use.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area at a young age and believes God is involved in her life. The living environment might influence behavior, but without evidence of issues like neglect or abuse, the impact is probably low.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are the most significant factors here. Since she has one prior offense, that's concerning. Her education level and job history are positive indicators. Her drug use in the past isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there were other issues which aren't mentioned. Her background is somewhat negative due to living with her mother but not drastically so.\n\nSo overall risk factors lean towards medium because of the prior arrest, despite some mitigating factors like education and job stability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"Her one prior arrest and one conviction are minor compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college may indicate higher risk of re-offboarding compared to those with more education or additional training.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the year suggests stable income and possibly better life circumstances, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.
