    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested three times but not convicted. Let me break down each risk factor.\n\nFirst, his lack of conviction might lower his risk since convictions are often needed for certain types of court sentences. But he has a history of arrests, so maybe that's still a medium concern.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, but maybe they influence something else? Probably not relevant here, so low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Unmarried status can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates in some contexts, like drug use or other issues. Not sure if that's high yet.\n\nGED certificate means he has some education, which might make him more employable and less likely to commit new crimes. So probably a low risk factor here.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year, so consistent work history is good. Unemployment could be a risk, but having multiple jobs suggests stability. Medium or lower?\n\nDrug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, might indicate substance abuse which can contribute to recidivism. The recent feelings of low mood could suggest other mental health issues. High risk factor here.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a rural area at a young age and considering God as part of his life. That's a bit complex. Maybe it suggests some level of support or higher likelihood of positive outcomes, but also might indicate past neglect if there are other factors not mentioned. Medium?\n\nPutting all these together: no conviction (medium), GED (low), job history (low), drug use (high), living situation (medium). So the overall risk would be influenced more by his drug use and previous arrests. He's got some mitigating factors like education and jobs, but also significant issues with substance abuse.\n\nTherefore, I'd predict a YES to rearrest within three years due to multiple high-risk factors dominating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No Conviction\", \"medium\", \"His lack of conviction might suggest he could face less severe penalties, but his prior arrests indicate some criminal history that could reappear.\"),\n    (\"GED Certificate\", \"low\", \"He has a GED and is not enrolled in college, which suggests employability and lower risk of involvement in the criminal justice system due to lack of formal education barriers.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Having held three jobs during the year indicates stable employment history, which can reduce recidivism risk but may still be a contributing factor if unstable or lost work leads to stress or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Feelings\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (primarily marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood could indicate ongoing mental health issues or substance abuse, both significant contributors to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a rural area may provide some level of support but could also be a sign of neglect if unaddressed social or emotional factors are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
