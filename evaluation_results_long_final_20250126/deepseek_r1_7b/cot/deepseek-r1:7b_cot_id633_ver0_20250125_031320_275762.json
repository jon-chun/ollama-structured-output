    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's Hispanic, has a history of four arrests and convictions, which is a red flag because more convictions usually mean higher risk. His age being young might make him more susceptible since he's still developing.\n\nHe doesn't have any formal education, which could limit his opportunities and increase dependency on substance abuse or welfare systems. That lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. He's single living alone, so maybe social support is lacking, but that could also be a risk factor if isolation leads to bad choices.\n\nUsing drugs for extended periods, especially during the past month when he felt really down, suggests he might still be struggling with substance abuse issues. That's definitely a high-risk factor because drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior opportunities.\n\nHe was raised in an urban area by both parents in a household of six, which could mean he experienced a lot of stress or neglect at a young age. Growing up in such an environment might contribute to behavioral issues that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHis belief in God might offer some moral guidance, but if it's not providing concrete support and structure, it might not be as protective. Moral support can sometimes help with substance abuse, but if he's still struggling, that's a concern.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014four arrests, lack of education, drug use, living alone, and past trauma\u2014the risk seems pretty high. I'm leaning towards a high risk because multiple strong indicators point to him being more likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant arrest history of four times, indicating past criminal behavior which is a clear indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may limit opportunities and increase dependency on substance abuse or welfare systems.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"He has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and felt extremely down during the past month, suggesting ongoing substance abuse issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"He is living alone, which may limit social support and increase isolation, potentially leading to risky choices or increased stress.\"),\n    (\"Family history\", \"high\", \"At a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six, indicating potential past trauma or neglect that could influence his behavior and decision-making.'),\n    (\"Moral support\", \"low\", \"He considers God to be involved in his personal life, but this belief may not provide the necessary structure or support needed to prevent substance abuse or criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
