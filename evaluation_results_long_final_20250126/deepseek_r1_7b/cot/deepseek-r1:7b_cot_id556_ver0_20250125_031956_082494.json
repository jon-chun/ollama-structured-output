    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is relatively young but still an adult. He's been arrested three times and has a conviction\u2014so past criminal history is definitely a red flag. Recidivism often increases with more prior offenses.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 140 lbs. I don't think his physical characteristics like weight or height directly influence recidivism risk, so this might be low relevance here.\n\n living alone: living situation can affect stress levels and access to support, but it doesn't directly relate to past criminal behavior or future risk.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school: education is a mitigating factor. People with higher education often have better job opportunities and skills that help reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe's held one job during the year: having a job can provide stability, which might reduce recidivism. However, if he was laid off or didn't work full-time, it could be another risk factor, but since only one job is mentioned, I'll consider it as a positive mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can have significant psychological impacts and might lead to unstable behavior, increasing recidivism risk. The recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues that could affect his judgment or self-control.\n\nPast living with a biological mother in a household of four: This is concerning as it suggests exposure to potential family dysfunction or neglect, which are known risk factors for recidivism. It can lead to emotional instability and higher chances of engaging in criminal behavior again.\n\nConsidering his religious belief in God could either be protective through moral guidance or a source of stress if it conflicts with his behavior. Without more info on how this affects him, I'll lean towards it being neutral but perhaps not directly related to risk unless he's struggling mentally.\n\nNow, putting it all together: Prior convictions (high), drug use and recent mood (high), living situation with family (high). These factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. The job held is a mitigating factor but may not be enough given the other strong risk indicators.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Risk Factors**: \n  - Prior convictions: High\n  - Drug use and recent mood: High\n  - Living with family (household size): High\n\nThe prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is high, so the final answer is \"YES\" with a confidence of 90%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple prior arrests and convictions which indicate past behavior that may influence future decisions.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_and_mood\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use combined with feelings of low mood suggests potential for unstable behavior, increasing risk of criminal activity again.\"),\n    (\"family_living\", \"high\", \"Living with a household of four in an urban area at a young age indicates possible exposure to family dysfunction or neglect, which are known risk factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
