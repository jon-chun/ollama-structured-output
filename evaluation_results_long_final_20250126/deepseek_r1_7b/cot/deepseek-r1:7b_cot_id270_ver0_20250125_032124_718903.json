    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this case to analyze. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested twice and has a conviction. That immediately raises some red flags because being a repeat offender can increase risk. Also, he's only 18, which means he's still developing his skills, so job experience isn't really a factor here.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 180 lbs. I'm not sure how that factors into recidivism, but maybe it could be related to substance use or physical health issues? But since he's been enrolled in school now, perhaps he's looking to change his situation, so weight might not be as critical here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Plus, having no support system could mean he's more susceptible to triggers or making bad choices.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the past year. Joblessness can be a risk factor because it provides less stability and fewer skills that might help prevent future issues. Without income, maybe he's more tempted to engage in risky activities like drug use.\n\nDrug use history is significant here\u2014he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse often goes hand in hand with other criminal behaviors, like theft or vandalism. It also increases the chance of engaging in dangerous situations that could lead to re-arrest.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month. If he's not feeling mentally well, it might be a sign of substance use disorders or other mental health issues. Depression can sometimes be a symptom of something more serious, which isn't addressed here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. That's quite a large family living in a dense city environment. Urban settings might offer more opportunities for exposure to crime or substance abuse. Also, being in a big household could lead to dependency on someone else, which is risky when the person is trying to make positive changes.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. That's interesting because religious beliefs can sometimes provide support but can also influence decision-making regarding risk-taking behaviors. However, I'm not sure how strong this factor is in predicting recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: He's a repeat offender, 18 years old, living alone without a job, has a drug history, and was in a large family in an urban area. All these factors point towards high risk of re-arrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"repeat_offender\", \"high\", \"He is a repeat offender with two prior convictions which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and employment_status\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old and currently living alone without a job may lead to increased risk behaviors such as substance abuse or making impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) can contribute to future criminal incidents, legal issues, or re-arrest.\"), \n    (\"family_environment\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of six with both parents in an urban area may have provided limited support and exposure to risk factors which could influence his behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_and_feeling\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month might indicate potential substance use issues or other mental health concerns that can contribute to risk behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
