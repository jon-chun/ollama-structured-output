    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this person over the next three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is a factor. He's 21, which is relatively young. Younger individuals are sometimes more likely to be involved in criminal activities because they might still be developing socially and economically. So I'd rate this as medium risk because while being younger does increase some risk factors, it's not the highest compared to other age groups.\n\nNext, gender. He's male. Statistically, males have higher arrest rates than females. This is a well-known factor in criminal justice statistics, so I think this should be a high-risk factor.\n\nRace and ethnicity here are Black. There's unfortunately systemic issues that lead to higher arrest rates for Black individuals, which can contribute to recidivism. So I'd rate this as medium risk because while it's a significant factor, there are also personal circumstances that might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nArrest history shows six arrests but no convictions. That means he's been in contact with the law multiple times, even if not convicted. This could indicate behavioral patterns or systemic issues. I think this should be medium risk because repeated interactions without convictions might suggest either systemic issues or possible future risks.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'7\" and 170 lbs. These are average for a male his age, so they don't really contribute much to the risk assessment. Low risk here.\n\nMarital status is single and living alone. Studies have shown that having a stable home environment can reduce recidivism. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a slight risk factor, but it's not extremely high. I'll rate this as low.\n\nEducation: no diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is linked to higher rates of criminal activity and recidivism because opportunities are more limited. This should be medium risk.\n\nEmployment history: held one job during the year. Having a stable job can reduce the likelihood of rearrest, but holding only one job might indicate instability or limited work history. So I think this is low risk but could have some impact.\n\nDrug use: none in the past four years. This is positive and should lower the risk because substance abuse is a significant factor in recidivism. Low risk here.\n\nDepression: no feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so absence here is good. Low risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family environment during upbringing can be protective against criminal behavior. So this should be low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God influences his personal life. Religious involvement has been shown to sometimes reduce recidivism rates as it provides support and structure. Low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are medium or low risk, with a couple high ones like gender. But overall, the protective factors seem significant enough that the prediction might lean towards no rearrest within three years. The confidence level is around 75% because while there are some risks, the positive factors balance them out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21, which is a young age often associated with higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing social and economic development.\"),\n     (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males statistically have higher arrest rates than females, contributing to a higher recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals face systemic factors that can increase arrest rates and contribute to recidivism risks.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Six arrests without convictions suggest potential behavioral patterns or systemic issues, but no convictions mitigate some risk.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone might reduce supervision but doesn't indicate high risk compared to other factors.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of formal education can limit opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job suggests some stability but could indicate limited work history.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in recent years reduces risk factors linked to substance abuse.\"),\n     (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Absence of depression lowers the risk associated with mental health issues contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents can be protective against criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence may provide support and structure reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
