    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 19-year-old male within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age at first arrest is 19. That's relatively young, but not extremely so. Younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing, but since he's already 19, maybe it's a bit lower than someone arrested as a juvenile. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nNext, gender: male. Studies show that males are more likely to be rearrested than females. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nRace/ethnicity: White. There isn't as much disparity in recidivism rates among whites compared to other groups, so this would be a low risk factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: two. Having multiple arrests can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to rearrest. So I'll rate this medium.\n\nConviction history: he's been convicted before. A conviction is a stronger indicator than just an arrest, so this is high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\" and 200-224 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a strong predictor of recidivism, but might be considered in certain contexts. I'll go with low here.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Unmarried individuals, especially those living alone without support systems, may have higher rearrest rates. This is medium risk.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior again. High risk here.\n\nEmployment history: held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might lead to recidivism. Medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is linked to higher rearrest rates as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity to sustain drug habits. High risk factor.\n\nDepression symptoms: none in the past month. Mental health issues are a concern, but since he's not currently depressed, this is low risk.\n\nFamily structure growing up: lived with biological mother in an urban area. Family environment plays a role; living with both parents might be protective, but here it was just his mother. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior. Medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn't believe God influences personal events. Research suggests that having religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism. So the lack of belief might indicate lower protective factors, making this medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium or high. The conviction history, drug use, education level, and gender are particularly strong indicators. So I predict a higher chance of rearrest, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age at first arrest\", \"low\", \"At 19 years old, he is relatively young but not extremely so, which may indicate lower risk compared to younger individuals.\"),\n     (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have a higher likelihood of rearrest compared to females, making this a significant risk factor.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"As White, there is less disparity in recidivism rates compared to other groups, indicating lower risk here.\"),\n     (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having two prior arrests suggests a pattern that could lead to rearrest, though not as severe as higher numbers.\"),\n     (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates stronger behavioral patterns linked to recidivism, making this a high-risk factor.\"),\n     (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size isn't typically a strong predictor of recidivism, so this is considered low risk.\"),\n     (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may contribute to higher rearrest rates due to lack of support systems.\"),\n     (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior again.\"),\n     (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might lead to recidivism, though it's not as strong a predictor as other factors.\"),\n     (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance use is linked to higher rearrest rates due to impaired judgment and potential involvement in crime for drug support.\"),\n     (\"Depression symptoms\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms in the past month indicate lower risk here.\"),\n     (\"Family structure growing up\", \"medium\", \"Living with one parent in an urban area might influence behavior, though not as strong a factor as others.\"),\n     (\"Religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's influence might reduce protective factors against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
