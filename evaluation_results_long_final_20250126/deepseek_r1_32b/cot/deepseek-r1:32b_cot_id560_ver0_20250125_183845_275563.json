    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a common risk factor. He's 21, which is young, and younger people are generally at higher risk because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis race/ethnicity is American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. There can be systemic factors affecting this group that might contribute to higher arrest rates, so I think this should also be a medium factor.\n\nHe's male, which statistically has been linked to higher crime rates compared to females. So gender here would be high risk.\n\nTwo prior arrests and at least one conviction indicate some history of criminal behavior. That definitely puts him in a higher risk category, so that's another high factor.\n\nHis height is 6'2\" and weight 160 lbs. I'm not sure how significant this is on its own, but maybe it suggests he's underweight or could be facing health issues which might contribute to other factors. I'll rate this as low.\n\nNever married and currently living alone can sometimes indicate a lack of social support, which might increase risk. So that would be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college, suggests educational challenges. Lower education is often linked with higher crime rates because of limited job opportunities. This should be high.\n\nUnemployed for the past year is a significant factor. Without steady employment, there's a higher chance of involvement in criminal activities. So that's another high risk.\n\nDrug use within the past four years, specifically marijuana, indicates substance issues which can lead to other crimes or recidivism. That's medium since it's not the most severe drug but still relevant.\n\nMental health issues\u2014feeling down in the dumps for some of the past month\u2014could point towards depression or anxiety, which might affect his behavior and decision-making. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area. While having both parents can be protective, urban areas might have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal activities. So I'm torn here but will go with low since family structure was intact.\n\nReligious belief\u2014feeling that God has something to do with personal events. This could provide some support or purpose which might reduce risk. So that's a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several high-risk factors like being male, prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment. Medium factors include age, ethnicity, mental health, and drug use. Low factors are height, living alone, family background, and religious beliefs.\n\nGiven the number of high and medium factors, I think the risk is higher than average, so predicting a YES for rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 21 falls into a higher-risk demographic for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut may face systemic factors contributing to risk.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender statistically correlates with higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate significant criminal history.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical measurements alone are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may reduce social support.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED correlates with higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment for a year increases likelihood of criminal involvement.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use within past four years suggests substance issues relevant to risk.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates potential mental health challenges affecting behavior.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area provides mixed factors.\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may offer support reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
