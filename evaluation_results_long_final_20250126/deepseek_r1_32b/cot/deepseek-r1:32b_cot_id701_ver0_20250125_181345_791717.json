    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for a 20-year-old female over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are more likely to be involved in criminal activities because they're still developing socially and emotionally. So, this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's White, so race might not be the biggest predictor here, but sometimes it can influence interactions with law enforcement. I'll rate that low.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest history is a moderate indicator of future behavior, especially if there are multiple arrests. Since she only had one, this is medium.\n\nHer weight and height don't seem to relate directly to recidivism risk, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone can sometimes lead to less supervision or support, which might increase risk. But it's not a strong indicator on its own, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important\u2014higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. However, since she has her diploma, maybe this is medium; if she were less educated, it would be higher.\n\nFour jobs in a year suggests some instability, which can be linked to higher risk. Job instability is a known factor, so that's high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a concern because substance use can lead to other criminal behaviors. This should be a medium or high factor. Given it's recent, I'll go with medium but leaning towards high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently reduces mental health-related risks, which is positive, so that's low.\n\nShe grew up with both parents in a rural area of five people. Stable upbringing might mitigate some risk factors. However, the impact can vary; if family support was strong, it could be protective. I'll rate this as low because while stable, it doesn't necessarily predict future behavior without other indicators.\n\nShe considers God uninvolved in her life. Religious beliefs or lack thereof can sometimes relate to behavior, but this is a weak factor and more context-dependent, so low.\n\nPutting it all together: the highest factors are job instability (high), drug use (medium), arrest history (medium). The protective factors include education, stable upbringing, no depression. Weighing these, there's a moderate risk of rearrest within three years, but I'm not very confident because some factors are conflicting.\n\nI think the prediction should be \"YES\" with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have higher rates of criminal behavior due to social and emotional development stages.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor in recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction indicates potential behavioral risks but lacks conviction impact.\"),\n     (\"weight_height\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism risk identified for weight and height.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_residence\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision, but not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive, but lack of higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n     (\"job_stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability linked to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can correlate with other criminal behaviors affecting risk assessment.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms reduce mental health-related risks.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing may offer some protection against recidivism, though context-dependent.\"),\n     (\"religion_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is a weak factor in predicting criminal behavior.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}",
