    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this 20-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Younger individuals are often more at risk because they might not have stable life circumstances yet. So, high risk here.\n\nSex is female. I remember that women generally have lower rearrest rates compared to men. So, low for this factor.\n\nRace is White. From what I know, race alone isn't a strong predictor unless other factors are involved. So, medium risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate risk, especially if there's no conviction yet\u2014maybe she's in the system but hasn't faced consequences. Medium.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'0\" and 180 lbs. Not sure how this affects recidivism. Maybe not a strong factor. Low.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk if there's lack of support. Medium because it might indicate some instability.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is moderate; having a diploma isn't the highest protective factor. So, medium.\n\nNine jobs in a year\u2014that's pretty unstable. Job instability is a big red flag for recidivism. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of rearrest. High risk.\n\nDepression symptoms: felt down in the dumps some days in the past month. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending. Medium, since it's not severe but present.\n\nUpbringing: grew up with both parents in a rural area. Stable upbringing might be protective. Low risk here.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has something to do with her life. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism. So, low.\n\nPutting this all together: high factors include age, drug use, and job instability. Medium include sex (though female is lower), arrest history, living alone, education, depression. Low include race, physical stats, upbringing, religion.\n\nThe high-risk factors are the main drivers here\u2014age being young, substance abuse, and unstable employment. These point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. The medium factors add to that risk but aren't as impactful as the highs. The low factors don't significantly mitigate the risks in this case.\n\nSo, I'd predict a YES for rearrest within three years with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age 20 is young and associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"sex\", \"low\", \"Female gender generally has lower rearrest rates compared to males.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals may have different systemic interactions affecting risk.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics not strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate potential instability or lack of support.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but no college may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Nine jobs in a year suggest significant instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is strongly linked to higher rearrest rates.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depression symptoms can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable environment may be protective.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
