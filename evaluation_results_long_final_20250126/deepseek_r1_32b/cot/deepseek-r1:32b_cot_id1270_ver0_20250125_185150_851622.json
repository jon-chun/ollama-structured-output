    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Age is a significant factor because younger individuals are generally more at risk for recidivism. Being in their early twenties can mean they're still developing socially and economically, which might contribute to higher risks. So I'll mark age as high.\n\nNext, he identifies as Hispanic. Race and ethnicity can sometimes correlate with systemic issues that affect recidivism rates, but this is a complex factor. It's not the primary driver, so I'll rate it medium.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a prior conviction is a strong indicator of future offending, especially if there's a pattern or specific circumstances around that conviction. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 1 inch and 240 lbs. Physical size can sometimes relate to the types of offenses someone might engage in, but it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates. So I'll keep this low.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation matters because stable housing and social support are protective factors. Being single and living alone removes some of those protections, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a big one. Without formal education, job prospects are limited, which can increase the risk of involvement in crime. That's a high factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is closely linked to recidivism because it reduces economic stability and opportunities for positive engagement. This should be high as well.\n\nDrug use within the last four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse, especially harder drugs like cocaine, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. Even if he's not currently using, past use indicates a potential issue that could resurface. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can complicate recidivism, but since he hasn't experienced depression recently, this might be protective. So low on this factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with four people. Family background and environment can influence behavior. Growing up in a stable household of four might offer some protection, so medium risk here.\n\nBelieves God influences personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and support network. So low on this aspect.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors include age, prior conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors are ethnicity, living alone, family background. Low factors are physical size, mental health, religious beliefs.\n\nConsidering the high number of significant risk factors, especially prior convictions, unemployment, and substance abuse, the prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. The confidence level is set at 75% because while several strong indicators point to recidivism, some protective factors like stable upbringing and religious beliefs provide a slight counterbalance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Individuals in their early twenties have higher rates of rearrest compared to older individuals.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Ethnicity can be a factor due to systemic issues, but it's not the primary driver of recidivism\"),\n     (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having a prior conviction is a strong predictor of future offending behavior\"),\n     (\"physical_size\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone does not significantly predict rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone can reduce social stability, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is strongly linked to higher rearrest rates due to limited opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases the likelihood of rearrest as it limits positive engagement\"),\n     (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Past drug use, especially harder substances like cocaine, correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression may provide some protective effect against rearrest\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a stable household might offer some protection against recidivism\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can serve as a protective factor through moral framework and support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
