    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment step by step. The individual is a 19-year-old male Hispanic who has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. He's living alone, has a GED, held one job in the past year, and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed recently. He grew up in an urban area with both parents in a household of six. His religious views don't tie into his personal experiences.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. At 19, he's still relatively young. Research shows that younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates because they're more likely to take risks and are influenced by peers. However, since he hasn't been convicted yet, the risk might be medium here.\n\nHis arrest history includes three arrests without convictions. This could indicate a pattern of behavior that brings him into contact with law enforcement but doesn't necessarily lead to convictions. The lack of convictions might mean either he's avoiding more severe charges or there's some oversight in the legal process. I'd rate this as high because multiple arrests suggest persistent issues.\n\nLiving alone at 19 can be both a positive and negative sign. On one hand, it shows independence; on the other, it might indicate limited social support, which could increase risks. Without family or roommates, he might not have the same level of supervision or guidance that others his age might have. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED but isn't in college. While having a high school equivalency is good, not pursuing higher education can limit future opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This would be a low risk factor because a GED is still better than no diploma, but it's a point to consider.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job in the past year. Consistent employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and income. However, only holding one job might indicate instability or limited work experience, which could be a medium risk factor since it's not as strong as having multiple jobs but better than being unemployed.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so this is a low risk factor. Similarly, not feeling depressed recently suggests mental health stability, another low risk area.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area can have both pros and cons. Urban environments might offer more opportunities but also come with higher crime rates and social challenges. However, since he had a stable upbringing with both biological parents in a larger household, this could provide some protective factors against recidivism. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis religious views might influence his behavior indirectly. Belief systems can sometimes act as deterrents from criminal activity, but the absence of such beliefs doesn't automatically mean higher risk. It's more about personal values and support networks. I'd rate this as low since there's no direct evidence linking his religious stance to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: His age is medium, arrest history high, living alone medium, education low, employment medium, substance use low, mental health low, upbringing medium, and religion low. The most significant factors are the arrest history and age, which lean towards higher risk. However, his stable family background, lack of current substance issues, and having a job mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards predicting recidivism as YES but with moderate confidence because while there are several risk factors, some protective elements might lower the likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 19 is associated with higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests without conviction suggest a pattern of behavior warranting attention.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may limit social support, increasing potential risks.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing higher education limits future opportunities.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job provides some stability but lacks extensive work experience.\"),\n     (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is positive and lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently indicates mental health stability.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents provides some protective factors but has challenges.\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
