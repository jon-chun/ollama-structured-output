Age is a known factor because younger individuals are often more involved in criminal activities. So, high risk here.\n\nHispanic identity might play a role due to potential systemic biases or community factors, but it's not as strong as other factors. Medium weight.\n\nHe has been arrested six times without convictions. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future issues. High risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment can limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of involvement in crime. High impact here.\n\nUnemployed for the past year means he's without stable income or structure, which is a big red flag. High risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 with no prior marriage could indicate lack of support systems or instability. Medium weight since it's less directly tied to criminal behavior.\n\nMarijuana use in the past four years can impair judgment and lead to increased risky behaviors. Medium impact.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently might be a positive, but mental health is complex. Low risk factor here.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with both parents in a large household\u2014stable upbringing usually reduces risk, so low weight.\n\nAtheism or lack of religious involvement doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high-risk factors like age, education, employment, and arrest history. Prediction is likely rearrest (YES) with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young male individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to factors such as impulsivity and social environment.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may face systemic biases but this factor alone does not significantly predict rearrest.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to future offenses.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases risk of involvement in criminal activities\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to lack of stable income and structure\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate lack of support systems which can contribute to risky behavior\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment and lead to increased risk-taking behaviors\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms suggest current mental health is stable, reducing this risk factor\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a rural area may provide some protective factors against recidivism\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement does not significantly correlate with rearrest rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
