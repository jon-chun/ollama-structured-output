    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they're less stable and more impulsive. So that's probably high.\n\nNext, gender as male. Men statistically have higher rates of recidivism than women. High again here.\n\nRace identified as Black. There are systemic issues leading to higher arrest rates for Black individuals, which can affect their chances. High factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a strong indicator, so that's high too.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\" and 180 lbs. Not sure how this plays into risk. Maybe average build doesn't contribute much, so low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Unstable living situations can be a risk factor because he might lack support systems. Medium here.\n\nEnrolled in school is positive. Education often reduces recidivism. So that's a protective factor, high.\n\nHeld five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which might lead to criminal activity. High risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Even though it's not severe, substance use can be linked to higher recidivism. Medium factor.\n\nFeeling down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism as they can impair decision-making and lead to criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure might be stable or not, but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to say. Probably low impact.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can be protective against recidivism as it provides structure and support. High factor here.\n\nPutting all these together: several high risk factors like prior conviction, age, gender, job instability, mental health, and substance use. But there are also some protective factors like being enrolled in school and having religious beliefs.\n\nSo the prediction is likely to be YES for rearrest recidivism with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age 20 falls into a higher-risk demographic for recidivism due to younger individuals often being less stable and more impulsive.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is associated with higher rates of recidivism compared to female\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic factors contributing to higher arrest rates, which can affect recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction is a significant predictor of future arrests and convictions\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height (6'1\\\") and weight (180 lbs) are not directly indicative of recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less stable social support systems which can be a risk factor\"),\n     (\"education_status\", \"high\", \"Currently enrolled in school is a protective factor as education often correlates with lower recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Holding 5 jobs in the past year suggests job instability, which can increase recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use over the last four years is a moderate risk factor, though not as severe as harder substances\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for some of the time in the past month indicates potential mental health issues which are significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a household size of 6 in urban area does not provide sufficient information to assess risk, but larger family size may offer some protective factors\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Believing God has a role in personal life can be a protective factor against recidivism as it provides structure and support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
