    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this individual's recidivism. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20 years old. I remember that younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So, maybe high risk here.\n\nNext, gender: he's male. From what I know, males tend to have higher arrest rates compared to females, so that could be another high-risk factor.\n\nEthnicity is Asian or Pacific Islander. I'm not entirely sure how this plays into recidivism rates. Some studies show disparities, but I think it might vary depending on other factors. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a bit conflicting because arrest doesn't always lead to conviction. Since there's no conviction, maybe the risk isn't as high as someone with multiple convictions. So perhaps low or medium here.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'4\" and between 125-149 lbs. I don't think physical stature directly affects recidivism much, unless it relates to other factors like access to certain crimes. Probably low risk.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Single status can sometimes correlate with higher risks because there might be less social support. Living alone could also mean fewer\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\nEducation: high school diploma but not in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Without further education, maybe medium risk.\n\nEmployment: held one job during the year. Stable employment can be protective against recidivism. Having a job might indicate some stability, so low risk here.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a significant factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. Definitely high risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. Mental health issues like depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated. Since he's not currently depressed, maybe low risk here.\n\nLived in a household of 8 at a young age. Large family size might have both positive and negative impacts. On one hand, more supervision; on the other, possibly less individual attention. I'm leaning towards medium risk because it could indicate either overcrowding or support systems.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidelines and social support. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors are medium or high, especially age, gender, drug use. The prediction is likely YES for rearrest within 3 years, but I'm not entirely sure about the confidence level. Maybe around 70% because some protective factors exist like employment and religious beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals are at higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have higher arrest rates than females.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Recidivism varies among ethnic groups; specific data may vary.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to convictions.\"),\n     (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might reduce supervision, increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but no college may correlate with moderate risk.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse significantly increases criminal behavior risk.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression suggests lower mental health-related risks.\"),\n     (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Large family size may indicate varying levels of support/supervision.\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
