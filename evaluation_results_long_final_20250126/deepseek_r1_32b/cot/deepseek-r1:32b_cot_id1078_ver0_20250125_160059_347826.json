    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male. Age is often considered in risk assessments because younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities due to factors like impulsivity and peer influence. Being male also tends to correlate with higher crime rates compared to females. So I'd say age and gender are both high risk factors.\n\nHe identifies as Black. Race can sometimes be a factor in recidivism, but it's important to consider that this might be influenced by systemic issues rather than the individual's characteristics. However, studies have shown disparities in arrest and conviction rates, so this could still contribute to higher risk. I'll mark race as medium.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and has convictions. A history of multiple arrests is a strong indicator of recidivism. Each arrest increases the likelihood of future interactions with the criminal justice system. So prior convictions are definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average (5'11\", 180 lbs). Physical attributes don't typically have a direct correlation with recidivism, so this would be low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Marital status can sometimes protect against recidivism because of the support and stability marriage might provide. Living alone could mean less supervision or fewer social ties that deter criminal behavior. So I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a significant factor. Lower education often correlates with higher rates of crime and recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and can lead to frustration and marginalization. This should be marked as high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment is linked to higher crime rates, likely due to financial stress and lack of legitimate means to earn money. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years. Substance abuse can increase criminal behavior, especially if seeking drugs or dealing with addiction-related issues. However, marijuana is less severe than harder substances, so I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms over the past month. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes lead to crime, but since he isn't experiencing these, it's a low-risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of three. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and living with both parents is generally protective against delinquency. But considering the other factors, I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any influence on his life. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk because religious communities often provide support and moral guidance. So spiritual beliefs would be a low-risk factor here.\n\nPutting it all together: high-risk factors include age, gender, prior convictions, education, unemployment; medium includes race, living alone, urban upbringing, drug use; low includes physical attributes, mental health, family structure, religion.\n\nGiven the multiple high-risk factors like age, prior convictions, lack of education, and unemployment, along with medium factors such as living alone and drug use, the likelihood of rearrest within three years seems quite high. The confidence level is pretty strong based on these indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals are more likely to engage in criminal activities due to impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"high\", \"Males have higher rates of criminal involvement compared to females.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Disparities in arrest and conviction rates exist, contributing to higher risk despite systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"History of multiple arrests strongly indicates likelihood of future interactions with the justice system.\"),\n     (\"Physical Attributes (Height/Weight)\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not correlate directly with recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social ties that deter criminal behavior and lacks marital support.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma limits job opportunities, increasing frustration and marginalization.\"),\n     (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial stress and higher crime rates due to limited legitimate income sources.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse can increase criminal behavior, though marijuana is less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (Depression Symptoms)\", \"low\", \"No symptoms of depression indicate lower risk compared to those experiencing mental health issues.\"),\n     (\"Upbringing/Environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose him to higher crime rates and lack of protective family structures.\"),\n     (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement might reduce access to supportive communities providing moral guidance.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
