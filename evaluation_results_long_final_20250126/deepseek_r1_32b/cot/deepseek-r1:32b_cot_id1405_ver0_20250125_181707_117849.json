    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and may be more impulsive. So, high risk here.\n\nNext, gender: male. Statistically, males have higher rearrest rates than females. That's a medium factor.\n\nEthnicity as Black might influence access to resources or systemic biases, which can affect recidivism. Medium weight on that.\n\nHe has three arrests and a conviction. Past behavior is a strong predictor of future actions, so high risk here.\n\nHeight and weight (6'0\", 168 lbs) don't seem relevant to rearrest risk. Low factor.\n\nNever married and living alone can mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. Medium impact.\n\nHigh school diploma is a positive, but not enrolled in college. Education level has mixed effects; some studies show higher education reduces recidivism, others not as much. So, medium here.\n\nNo jobs in the past year indicates unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. High risk factor.\n\nDrug use within four years (marijuana) suggests substance involvement, which can lead to criminal activity or poor decisions. Medium weight.\n\nFeeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues, which might contribute to recidivism if untreated. Medium factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household with biological mother in urban area. Urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates and fewer resources, which can be risk factors. Medium impact here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially past convictions, unemployment, and substance use, the prediction leans towards rearrest. Confidence is around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases the likelihood of recidivism due to ongoing development and impulsivity.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher rates of rearrest compared to females in general populations.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic factors influencing recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests with a conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is predictive of future offending.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical dimensions are not typically associated with rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may reduce social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment has mixed effects on recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of rearrest due to limited legal opportunities and increased stress.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years suggests potential substance involvement, which can lead to criminal behavior or impaired decision-making.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible mental health issues that may contribute to recidivism if untreated.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may present environmental risks contributing to recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
