    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to tackle this risk assessment step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old White female with specific background details. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, age. She's 21, which is relatively young. Studies show that younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, this might not carry as much weight. I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, gender. Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males. This factor should be low.\n\nHer race is White. While there's some discussion about disparities, White individuals typically don't have higher recidivism rates. So, another low factor here.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. An arrest without a conviction can indicate either a lack of serious involvement or an acquittal. Since it's only one incident and no conviction, this might not be a strong predictor. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight at 5'6\" and 160 lbs don't correlate strongly with recidivism. So, low here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if it means less supervision or support, but she's managing on her own without issues noted. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHigh school diploma with no college enrollment. Education level is important; higher education often reduces recidivism. Since she stopped at high school and isn't in college, this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment can be protective against recidivism, so this is a positive sign. Low risk here.\n\nNo drug use in four years but some depression recently. Substance abuse is a strong predictor, but she's clean for a while. However, her current mental health could be an issue. I'll consider this medium since mental health struggles can sometimes lead to risky behaviors without substance involvement.\n\nRaised by both parents in a rural area with household size 3. Stable upbringing and family support are protective factors. Low risk here.\n\nReligious belief\u2014she believes God influences her life. Religious involvement is generally associated with lower crime rates. Another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of factors are low or medium. The arrest without conviction and mental health are the main concerns, but they're not strong enough to predict a high likelihood of rearrest. So, I'll predict NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young and not in a high-risk age range for recidivism\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not correlate strongly with rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"arrest_count\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction suggests potential legal involvement, but the lack of a conviction may indicate less serious behavior or resolved charges\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to potential lack of social support, but this individual is managing independently without reported issues\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma only; higher education is often associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs in the past year indicates some level of employment stability, which can be protective against rearrest\"),\n     (\"substance Abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years; substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, but this individual has been clean for several years\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression could indicate potential stressors that may influence behavior, though there is no indication of substance use or other major mental health issues\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Raised by both biological parents in a stable household size of 3 in a rural area suggests a relatively stable upbringing and family support, which are protective factors against recidivism\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has something to do with personal events can indicate strong religious involvement, which is often associated with lower crime rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
