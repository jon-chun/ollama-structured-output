    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism. Let me break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female. Age is a factor here. Younger individuals are sometimes more likely to engage in risky behaviors, but females statistically have lower rates of rearrest compared to males. So age could be medium because while being young might increase risk, her gender slightly mitigates that.\n\nShe identifies as White. Racial factors can influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but this alone doesn't directly indicate recidivism. I'll note it as low impact unless other factors compound it.\n\nThree arrests and a conviction history are significant. Having prior convictions is a strong indicator of future offending. This should be high because past behavior is often predictive of future actions.\n\nHer height and weight (5'3\", 175-199 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I'll mark this as low impact.\n\nNever married and not living alone could indicate lower social support, which might increase the likelihood of rearrest. This should be medium because living without a spouse or alone can reduce accountability and supportive networks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests limited education, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. This is a high risk factor as education often correlates with better job prospects and lower criminal activity.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history is mixed; having some work experience can be positive, but only two jobs might indicate instability. I'll rate this medium because stable employment can reduce recidivism, but limited job tenure could be a concern.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) within the last four years is a high risk factor. Substance abuse is closely tied to criminal behavior and relapse into crime upon release.\n\nFeeling down in the dumps some of the time during the past month indicates possible mental health issues, which can increase recidivism if untreated. This should be high because mental health struggles can impair judgment and coping mechanisms.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her mother in a household size of 4 might influence her environment but doesn't directly indicate risk unless other factors are present. I'll mark this as low since it's more about background than direct predictors.\n\nShe considers God significant, which could provide some moral guidance or support. This is a protective factor and should be marked as low because it might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the high-risk factors like prior convictions, drug use, mental health issues, and lack of education stand out. These suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest. The confidence level is around 80% considering the significant predictors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher risk but gender mitigates\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White, no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n     (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and a conviction history increase risk\"),\n     (\"weight_height\", \"low\", \"Unrelated to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, not living alone may reduce social support\"),\n     (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED linked to higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs in a year suggests possible instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance issues\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down suggests potential mental health concerns\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with mother, neutral factor\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide protective support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
