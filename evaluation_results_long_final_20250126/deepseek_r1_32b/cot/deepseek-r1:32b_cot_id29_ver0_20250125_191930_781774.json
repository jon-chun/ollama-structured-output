    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment step by step. The subject is a 20-year-old Hispanic female with certain characteristics that I need to evaluate for rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Young individuals are often still developing and may not have stable lives yet, which could contribute to higher risks. However, at 20, she's slightly older than typical adolescents, so maybe the risk isn't as high as it would be for someone younger. I'll note this as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but no conviction suggests either lack of evidence or successful diversion. This could still reflect a higher likelihood of future issues compared to someone with no arrests. So, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHer weight is between 200-224 lbs at 5'1\". Obesity can be linked to health issues that might affect her lifestyle and mental state, potentially contributing to stress or substance use. This seems relevant but not the most direct factor for recidivism. I'll assign low risk here.\n\nLiving alone without being married could mean she's independent, which is positive, but it might also indicate limited social support. Without a spouse or family nearby, she might face challenges that could lead to stress or crime as a coping mechanism. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is generally protective against recidivism because education can provide structure and opportunities. However, balancing school with other aspects of life can be stressful, especially if she's working multiple jobs. I'll consider this as a low risk since education tends to have a positive influence.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could lead to financial stress and potential criminal behavior. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nMarijuana use over the past four years is a concern because substance use can impair judgment and increase involvement in illegal activities. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so I'll classify this as medium risk.\n\nShe reported feeling down for some time in the past month. Depression or low mood can impair decision-making and lead to self-destructive behaviors, potentially increasing recidivism risk. This should be a high-risk factor because mental health issues are strong predictors of criminal behavior.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a household size of six might have exposed her to environmental stressors like crime and poverty, which can contribute to higher risk. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe considers God influential in her life. Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. This should be noted as low risk because it's more of a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting all these together: the high-risk factor is her current depressive symptoms, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest. The medium factors include age, prior arrest without conviction, living alone, frequent job changes, marijuana use, and urban upbringing. Low risks are her weight, education, and religious beliefs.\n\nConsidering these, the prediction leans towards a higher risk of recidivism within three years. I'll estimate a confidence level around 75%, reflecting moderate certainty given the mix of factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The subject is 20 years old, which is associated with a higher risk of recidivism compared to older individuals but lower than younger adolescents.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction suggests some level of involvement in potentially risky behavior, though not conclusive evidence of criminal conduct.\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight may indicate potential health issues but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to limited social support, which may increase stress and risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n     (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school is generally protective against recidivism as it provides structure and opportunities.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests possible instability or challenges in maintaining consistent employment.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use can indicate substance involvement, which may correlate with higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression can impair decision-making and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a large household size may expose individuals to environmental stressors that can contribute to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
