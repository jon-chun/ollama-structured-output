    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old Black male within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is typically a risk factor because younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities. At 22, he's still relatively young, so that might carry some weight.\n\nNext, being male also plays a role since males are statistically more prone to recidivism than females.\n\nHis race as Black could influence the assessment due to systemic factors and higher arrest rates in certain communities, though this is a sensitive area. It should be considered cautiously.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has convictions. A higher number of prior arrests usually correlates with increased risk, so that's a significant factor here.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, but maybe they can indicate other aspects like health or social environment. Since they're within average ranges, I'll mark them as low impact.\n\nNever being married and not living alone are both factors. Unmarried status might relate to less stability, while living with others could mean either support or influence from roommates. These probably have a medium effect on risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED can limit job opportunities, leading to higher unemployment rates, which is linked to recidivism. That's a strong factor.\n\nHolding three jobs in a year suggests some level of employment stability but could also indicate difficulty maintaining consistent work, which might be a medium concern.\n\nDrug use within the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014is a risk factor since substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior. The fact that he doesn't feel depressed recently might mitigate this somewhat, so it's a moderate influence.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and three others could indicate exposure to certain environments but also family support. This is probably a low impact factor.\n\nLastly, believing God influences personal events suggests some level of religious engagement, which can be protective against recidivism. That should be marked as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest, especially considering prior convictions and lack of education. However, the protective factors like religious beliefs might slightly reduce the confidence in the prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\":  [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 22 is within a high-risk demographic for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is a significant predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic factors influencing arrest rates, though this factor is approached cautiously to avoid bias.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction history strongly correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height of 5'8\\\" does not significantly impact recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight of 165 lbs is within average range and not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate less social stability, which can influence recidivism risk moderately.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone could reflect either support systems or potential influences from roommates, affecting risk moderately.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits job opportunities, increasing unemployment risk linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests some employment instability which may modestly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use within the past four years is a moderate risk factor, though not as severe as harder substances or more recent use.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported over the past month reduces immediate mental health-related risks.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an urban area with biological mother and household of size four may indicate exposure to certain environmental factors, though this is a low impact factor.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief that God influences personal events suggests some level of religious engagement, which can be protective against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
