    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this individual. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Young adults are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, but as they get older, this tendency often decreases. So, a low weight here.\n\nNext, being male. Studies show that men are rearrested more frequently than women. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nRace identified as White. There\u2019s some debate about race and recidivism. Some argue systemic issues may affect outcomes, but without more context, I'll mark this as low.\n\nThree arrests with convictions indicate past involvement in the criminal justice system. This suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest, so high weight.\n\nHeight and weight are average\u20145'9\" and 160 lbs. Not directly linked to recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nNever married and living alone can be factors. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase risk. Medium weight.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is a moderate factor; higher education tends to correlate with lower recidivism. So medium.\n\nHeld three jobs in the past year. Employment instability could lead to criminal activity if someone can\u2019t maintain steady work. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of rearrest, so high weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he\u2019s not currently depressed, this is low.\n\nGrowing up with both parents in a rural area. Stable upbringing might lower risk. Low factor here.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, so medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like prior convictions, substance abuse, and employment instability. Prediction is YES for rearrest within three years with a confidence of 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is relatively young but not in the highest-risk age range for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Being male is associated with higher rates of rearrest compared to females.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in criminal justice outcomes, the individual's self-identification as White does not inherently indicate a high risk of recidivism without additional context.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Three prior arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may increase the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stature is not directly correlated with rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to lack of social support.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment may indicate limited opportunities for stable employment, which can be a risk factor for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Holding three jobs in the past year suggests potential instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine within the last four years is a significant predictor of rearrest, as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces the likelihood of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household may provide protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has an influence on personal events can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates due to potential prosocial influences.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
