    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a known risk factor. He's 21, which is young, and younger individuals are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activities. So I think that's a medium risk because while it's significant, it might not be the highest factor on its own.\n\nNext, gender. He's male, and studies show that males have higher rates of recidivism compared to females. That should definitely be a high-risk factor because gender is a strong predictor in many cases.\n\nEthnicity as Hispanic. I know there can be disparities in the criminal justice system, but I'm not sure how significant this factor is on its own. It might contribute but perhaps isn't as impactful as other factors like age or education. So maybe low risk here.\n\nArrest history: he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's pretty notable because having prior convictions is a strong indicator of future recidivism. I think this should be high risk because past behavior often predicts future actions.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so those can probably be low risk factors as they don't influence the likelihood much.\n\nMarital status: he's separated and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk. But being separated isn't as impactful as other factors like unemployment or education. I think medium here because it does have some effect but not as strong as others.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, and not in college. Low education is a big factor because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher engagement in criminal activities. This should be high risk.\n\nEmployment status: he hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is linked to higher crime rates as people might turn to illegal activities for income. So this is definitely high risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recent feelings of depression. Drug use is a significant factor because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior to sustain habits or due to impaired judgment. Plus, mental health issues like depression can exacerbate these behaviors. That should be high risk.\n\nLiving situation as a child: he was with non-biological parents in an urban area. Family environment can influence behavior, but I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors. Maybe low or medium? Since the info isn't too detailed, maybe low.\n\nReligious views: he doesn't believe God affects his life. Some studies suggest that lack of religious involvement might correlate with higher risk, but it's a softer factor compared to others. So perhaps low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are high or medium. The age, gender, prior convictions, education, employment, and drug use are strong indicators. The prediction should be YES for rearrest within three years, and confidence is pretty high because of the multiple significant factors. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age (21) increases risk as younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal activities.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not significantly predict recidivism without additional context.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and is associated with higher criminal engagement.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to increased involvement in illegal activities for income.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse_mental_health\", \"high\", \"Drug use and depression are significant predictors of recidivism due to impaired judgment and potential for criminal activity to sustain habits.\"),\n     (\"family_environment_childhood\", \"low\", \"Non-biological family environment may have some influence, but lacks sufficient detail for strong prediction.\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement might correlate with higher risk, though this is a softer factor.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
