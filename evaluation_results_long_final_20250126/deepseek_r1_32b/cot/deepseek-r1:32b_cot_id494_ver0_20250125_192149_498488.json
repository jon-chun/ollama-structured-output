    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a significant factor. At 19, he's relatively young. Research shows that younger individuals are more likely to recidivate because they're still developing socially and emotionally. So I'll mark age as high risk.\n\nNext, gender. He identifies as male. Statistically, males have higher rates of arrest and recidivism compared to females. This is a well-documented trend, so I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nRace here is White. While there's discussion about racial disparities in the criminal justice system, for predictive purposes, race alone isn't typically a strong indicator unless other factors like systemic bias are considered. So I'll note race as low risk with that reasoning.\n\nHe has one arrest and a conviction. Having prior convictions is a key predictor of future offending. Even though it's just once, it still indicates some propensity towards reoffending. This will be medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 144 lbs. These physical attributes don't have a direct correlation with recidivism rates that I'm aware of. So this factor is low risk.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate less social support, which might be a risk factor. However, being single isn't inherently a bad thing. This one's a bit tricky but I'll rate it medium because the lack of marital ties can sometimes relate to lower stability.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Educational attainment is important. A GED is better than not having a high school diploma, but not pursuing higher education might limit future opportunities, potentially increasing recidivism risk. So I'll mark this as medium.\n\nFour jobs in a year suggests some instability in employment. Frequent job changes can sometimes be linked to difficulty maintaining steady work, which might correlate with higher criminal activity rates. This is another medium factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. Both are positive signs. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so his clean time here lowers risk. Mental health issues like depression can also contribute to reoffending when untreated. Since he's not experiencing these, this is low risk.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his mother and three others. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, but family structure is more influential. He lived with both parents, which is generally protective against delinquency. So environment is medium because of the urban setting but mitigated by a stable family background.\n\nReligious beliefs: he believes God influences his life. Studies show that strong religious involvement can be protective against criminal behavior by providing a moral framework and social support. This is a low risk factor as it's a protective measure.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors are medium or high with some lows. Considering the prior conviction, young age, and employment instability, the likelihood of rearrest seems higher than average. So I'll predict a \"YES\" with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to factors like impulsivity and lack of maturity\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have statistically higher rates of arrest and recidivism compared to females\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may experience different systemic biases but this factor alone isn't a strong predictor\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having prior convictions is a significant predictor of future offending\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not have a direct correlation with recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone can indicate lower social support, which may increase risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing higher education may limit future opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year suggests employment instability, which can be a risk factor\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk associated with substance abuse\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month indicates good mental health, which is protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may increase exposure to crime, but living with both parents provides some protection\"),\n     (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing that God influences personal events can provide a moral framework and social support, reducing risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
