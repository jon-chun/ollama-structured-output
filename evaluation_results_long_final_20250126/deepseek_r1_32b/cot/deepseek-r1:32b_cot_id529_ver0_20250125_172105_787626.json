    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, gender is male. Studies show males have higher recidivism rates than females. So, that's a high risk factor.\n\nAge is 19. Young adults are more likely to reoffend because they're still developing socially and cognitively. High again.\n\nEthnicity as Hispanic \u2013 there might be systemic factors or discrimination affecting this group, so medium weight here.\n\nHe has two arrests and one conviction. Multiple contacts with the justice system can indicate higher risk. So, high.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Lack of education is linked to higher crime rates because it limits job opportunities. High.\n\nUnemployed at the time of assessment? Wait, he held two jobs in a year. That's actually positive. Employment reduces recidivism risk, so low.\n\nLiving alone can be a risk if there's no support system. Medium.\n\nNever married. Marital status can provide stability, so not being married might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHousehold size at age 5 was 5. Larger households might have less supervision, but I'm not sure how significant that is. Maybe low impact.\n\nBelieves in God \u2013 religious involvement often reduces recidivism, so that's positive. Low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use for four years and no recent depression. Both are protective factors against reoffending. So both get low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: high gender, high age, medium ethnicity, high criminal history, high education, low employment, medium living alone, medium marital status, low household size, low religion, low substance use, low mental health. \n\nMost of the factors are either high or medium. So the prediction would be a higher risk of rearrest, but not extremely high confidence because some protective factors exist.\n\nI think the confidence should be around 65% \u2013 more likely than not to reoffend, but with significant mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Gender: Male\", \"high\", \"Males are statistically at higher risk for recidivism compared to females.\"),\n     (\"Age: 19 years old\", \"high\", \"Young adults aged 18-24 have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing cognitive and social development.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity: Hispanic\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may face systemic challenges contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Criminal History: 2 arrests, 1 conviction\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a prior conviction are strong predictors of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Education Level: No high school diploma/GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of formal education correlates with higher crime rates and limited employment opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Employment Status: Held 2 jobs in the past year\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism risk; having multiple jobs may indicate adaptability and work ethic.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation: Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, potentially increasing recidivism risk without family supervision.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Single individuals might lack the stability marriage can provide, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"Household Size at Age 5: 5 people\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may offer less individual attention but doesn't directly predict rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief: Believes God influences personal events\", \"low\", \"Strong religious beliefs are associated with lower recidivism rates through structured moral guidance.\"),\n     (\"Substance Use: No drug use past 4 years\", \"low\", \"No recent substance use is a protective factor against reoffending as it reduces addiction-driven crimes.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health: Not depressed past month\", \"low\", \"Recent mental health stability can reduce the likelihood of impulsive or stress-related offenses.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
