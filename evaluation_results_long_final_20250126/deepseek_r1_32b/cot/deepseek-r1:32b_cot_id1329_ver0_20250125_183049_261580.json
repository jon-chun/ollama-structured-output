    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this 18-year-old Hispanic male's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Young offenders often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and more influenced by peers or circumstances. So I'll mark age as high risk.\n\nHe's male, which statistically has a higher rearrest rate compared to females. That's another high-risk factor.\n\nHispanic ethnicity\u2014research shows that certain groups may face systemic issues leading to higher arrest rates. So medium risk here.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Multiple arrests increase the likelihood of future offenses. High risk for this factor.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'5\" and 130 lbs. Physical size isn't a direct indicator, so low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. Unstable living situations can contribute to recidivism. Medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. High risk here.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment is protective, but only two jobs might indicate instability. Medium risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years and recent feelings of depression. Substance abuse and mental health issues are strong predictors. High risk for both factors.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a large household. Stable family background can be protective, so low risk here.\n\nUrban upbringing may expose him to higher crime rates or influences. Medium risk.\n\nBelieves God affects his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes offer support against recidivism. Low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Most factors are medium or high. The combination of age, gender, educational status, drug use, and mental health significantly increases the risk. So prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (18)\", \"high\", \"Young individuals have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and influence from peers or environment.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"high\", \"Statistically, males have higher rearrest rates compared to females.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (Hispanic)\", \"medium\", \"Certain ethnic groups may face systemic factors contributing to higher arrest rates.\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests (2)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests are a strong predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Conviction History (1)\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction history increases the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight (5'5\\\", 130 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical stature is not a direct risk factor for recidivism\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never Married)\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried individuals may have less social support, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"Residency (Living Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate lack of supervision or social support, which may contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"Education Level (No HS Diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lower educational attainment is linked to higher rates of recidivism\"),\n     (\"Employment History (2 jobs in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in past 4 years)\", \"high\", \"Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential addiction and associated criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (Depressed in past month)\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues, such as depression, are linked to higher rates of recidivism due to impaired judgment and coping mechanisms\"),\n     (\"Family Background (Both biological parents, household size 9)\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents can provide stability, which is protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"Upbringing Environment (Urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime rates or influences that contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs (Believes God affects personal events)\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can offer support and guidance, potentially reducing recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
