    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female. Age is usually considered in risk assessments because younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, being female might lower the risk since women generally have lower arrest rates than men. So age and gender together might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure if there's specific data on Hispanic females affecting rearrest rates, but sometimes race can be a factor due to systemic issues. Maybe this is low unless there are other indicators.\n\nFour arrests with convictions. That seems significant. More arrests and convictions usually correlate with higher recidivism. So that should probably be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'4\" and 180 lbs. I don't know how body size affects rearrest rates, but maybe it's not a strong factor. Probably low.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living situation can affect stability. Being single and alone might contribute to higher risk if she lacks support systems. Medium perhaps.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education level is important. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities. Maybe medium because it's better than no diploma but not as protective as higher education.\n\nHeld three jobs in a year. Job stability can be a protective factor. Three jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. So high for job stability issues.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism. It shows substance abuse issues that can lead to criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nDepression symptoms: felt down in the dumps some days in the past month. Mental health issues like depression are linked to higher rearrest rates, as they can affect judgment and behavior. Medium risk factor.\n\nHousehold size of six when young. Growing up in a large household might indicate economic hardship or lack of attention, which could contribute to risk factors. Maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God affects her personally. Religious belief can sometimes be protective, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that's probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: she has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, drug use, and job instability, along with some medium ones like age/gender, living alone, and depression. The protective factors are her education and religious beliefs, but those might not be enough to offset the other risks.\n\nSo I think there's a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years, maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk but being female may lower it\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"No specific data indicating higher risk for Hispanic females\"),\n     (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions correlate with recidivism\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Body size not a significant factor in rearrest likelihood\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support systems contributing to risk\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is protective but no higher education limits opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Job instability indicates difficulty maintaining employment, a risk factor\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use history increases likelihood of rearrest\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms linked to higher rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may indicate economic hardship contributing to risk factors\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be protective against criminal behavior\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
