Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Research shows that younger individuals are more likely to recidivate because they're still developing maturity. So this might be a medium risk.\n\nHe's White. In some studies, race can influence outcomes, but it's not the strongest factor here. Maybe low.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Having an arrest without a conviction is somewhat concerning, but since there's no conviction, the impact might be lower. Medium.\n\nHeight and weight are average (5'10\", 180 lbs). No significant risk tied to this. Low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to less supervision or support, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma with college enrollment is positive. Education reduces recidivism risk, so low here.\n\nTwo jobs in the last year show some stability, but it's not super strong. Medium because inconsistent employment might still pose some risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years is a significant factor. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important; since there's no depression, this is low risk.\n\nLived with non-biological parents as a child in an urban area of size 3. Family instability can be a risk, so medium.\n\nBelieves God has personal impact. Religious belief can provide support and lower recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high from drug use, medium from age, arrest history, living alone, family background, and employment. The positives are education, religious beliefs. Prediction is YES with moderate confidence because of the strong drug factor but some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 22 falls within a higher-risk demographic for recidivism as younger individuals may still be developing decision-making skills and impulse control.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a significant predictor of recidivism when controlled for other factors, but it can reflect systemic issues that may influence outcomes indirectly.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential legal involvement, though lack of conviction reduces the weight compared to a conviction history.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not directly predictive of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married can sometimes correlate with reduced social support, which may increase risk, but this individual's circumstances do not present extreme concern.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college indicates educational attainment, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests some level of stability and responsibility, but it also might indicate instability if jobs are inconsistent or short-term.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine within the past four years is a strong predictor of rearrest, particularly as substance use can lead to criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces risk associated with mental health issues that could contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents at a young age may reflect family instability, which can be a risk factor for delinquency and recidivism if not compensated by other protective factors.\"),\n     (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's personal impact suggests a potential source of moral guidance and support, which can reduce recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
