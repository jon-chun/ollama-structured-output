    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence their behavior. However, females generally have lower rates of recidivism compared to males. So I think age here would be low risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic factors that affect arrest rates, but on its own, race isn't a direct indicator of recidivism. So this might also be low.\n\nShe's been arrested 9 times and has convictions. That's a significant number of arrests, which suggests a pattern of behavior that leads to encounters with the law. This should definitely be a high-risk factor because multiple arrests are strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer height is 5'3\" and weight is 105 lbs. Physical size might not directly relate to criminal behavior, so this would likely be low risk.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can impact stability. Not being in a committed relationship or living alone might reduce some support systems but isn't necessarily high risk on its own. Maybe medium because it could indicate limited social support.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level is important. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities. This would be medium risk as lower educational attainment can correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nHeld 1 job in the past year. Employment history is crucial. One job suggests some stability, but if it's inconsistent or low-paying, it could still pose a risk. I think this is low because having a job generally reduces recidivism chances, even if it's just one.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, especially illicit drugs, can be linked to criminal behavior and recidivism. This should be medium as marijuana isn't as severe as harder drugs but still indicates some substance involvement.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is a big factor. Not feeling depressed is positive and lowers risk compared to someone with mental health issues. So this would be low.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of 5. Family structure and environment can influence behavior. Growing up in a stable family might mitigate some risks, especially if it's a supportive environment. This is low because a stable upbringing generally reduces recidivism risk.\n\nDoesn't believe God affects personal events. Spiritual beliefs might relate to coping mechanisms. Lack of belief doesn't directly correlate with higher crime rates, so this would be low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the biggest red flags. The medium factors like substance use and education level add to the risk. Despite some protective factors like age, gender, and mental health, the history of multiple arrests significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nThe assessment considers various factors, with a focus on the individual's extensive arrest history as the primary indicator of high recidivism risk. Other moderate factors include substance use and education level, while protective elements such as age, gender, and mental health are present but not sufficient to offset the significant risks.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21-year-old female, younger individuals may still be developing socially.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Identifies as White, race alone doesn't directly indicate recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"9 arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Physical Size\", \"low\", \"5'3\\\" and 105 lbs, not directly related to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married, not living alone may reduce social support.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job, employment generally reduces recidivism chances.\"),\n     (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana recently, indicates some substance involvement.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, positive for lower risk.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother in urban area.\"),\n     (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief doesn't directly correlate with higher crime rates.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
