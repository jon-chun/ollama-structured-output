    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. Young adults are generally at higher risk because they're still developing impulse control and decision-making skills. So that would be a medium risk factor.\n\nGender is male. Statistically, males have higher arrest rates than females, so this is another medium factor.\n\nRace identified as Black. There's systemic disparity in the criminal justice system affecting Black individuals more, so this is high.\n\nOne prior arrest with conviction suggests some history but not extensive. That's a medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so I'll skip that.\n\nNever married and living alone could indicate less social support, which might contribute to higher risk. Medium factor.\n\nGED indicates some education but not higher. Not enrolled in college means fewer opportunities, so this is medium.\n\nTwo jobs in the past year suggests some stability, which is positive. Low risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years and recent depressive feelings indicate possible substance issues and mental health concerns. Both are high risk factors because they can lead to poor decisions or involvement in illegal activities.\n\nGrowing up with biological mother in an urban area of size 2\u2014living in a small household might mean less supervision or more stress, which is medium risk.\n\nBelief in God could provide some support but doesn't directly affect recidivism. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several high factors like race and substance use, plus mediums like age and gender. The positives are holding jobs and education, but the negatives might outweigh them. I predict a higher chance of rearrest with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (19)\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and lack of maturity.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"medium\", \"Males are statistically more likely to be rearrested than females.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity (Black)\", \"high\", \"Systemic disparities contribute to higher arrest rates for Black individuals.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions (1 conviction)\", \"medium\", \"Having a prior conviction increases risk, but one offense may not indicate chronic offending.\"),\n     (\"Education Level (GED)\", \"medium\", \"Higher education correlates with lower recidivism; having a GED is a moderate indicator.\"),\n     (\"Employment Status (2 jobs in the past year)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk, though short-term may not be as protective.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in past 4 years)\", \"high\", \"Substance use can impair judgment and increase likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (Depressed feelings)\", \"high\", \"Untreated mental health issues can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Family Background (Mother, urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a small household in an urban area may present challenges but doesn't inherently indicate high risk.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief may provide some support but is not directly predictive of rearrest.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 143 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
