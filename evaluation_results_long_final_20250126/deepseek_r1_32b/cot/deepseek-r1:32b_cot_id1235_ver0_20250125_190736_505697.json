    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So, high weight here.\n\nNext, gender: male. Studies show that males are more likely to commit crimes than females, so this gets a medium weight.\n\nRace is Black. There's a lot of systemic issues leading to overrepresentation in the criminal justice system, but I'm cautious about assigning higher risk based solely on race without other factors. So, low weight here.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. An arrest could indicate some level of involvement with the law, but no conviction means there wasn't enough evidence. Medium weight because it shows some interaction but not a proven offense.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\", 170 lbs. These are average stats, so they don't contribute much to risk. Low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living without family support can be a factor. Single individuals might have less supervision or support, which could increase recidivism risk. Medium weight here.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is moderate\u2014some education reduces risk but not as protective as higher education. So, low to medium. I'll go with medium because having a high school diploma is better than none.\n\nWork history: held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment can be protective against recidivism. This should be a low weight since it's positive but doesn't fully mitigate other factors.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if not severe, can increase risk by impairing judgment or leading to situations where crimes are more likely. Medium weight.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently. Mental health is important; no current issues lower the risk. Low weight here since it's positive but doesn't strongly influence recidivism on its own.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Large families, especially in high-crime areas, can sometimes increase exposure to negative influences. Medium weight because environment plays a role.\n\nReligious beliefs: God has nothing to do with personal events. Lack of religious involvement might reduce protective factors that religion can provide for some individuals. Low weight since this isn't as strong a predictor as other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: several medium and high factors like age, gender, arrest history, living situation, and environment. Some low weights from education, employment, no depression. The confidence is moderate because while there are risk factors, the protective ones (education, work) temper the prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases recidivism risk as individuals may still be developing socially and emotionally.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have a higher likelihood of committing crimes compared to females, contributing to medium risk.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"While systemic issues exist, race alone without other factors doesn't heavily influence risk.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"An arrest indicates some legal interaction but no conviction reduces its weight as a predictor.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical stats don't significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision, increasing risk moderately.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma provides some protection against recidivism but not as strong as higher education.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is protective but doesn't fully mitigate other risks.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use can impair judgment and increase risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms recently lower the associated risk factor.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing in a large household may expose to negative influences, increasing risk moderately.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement might reduce protective factors but isn't a strong predictor.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
