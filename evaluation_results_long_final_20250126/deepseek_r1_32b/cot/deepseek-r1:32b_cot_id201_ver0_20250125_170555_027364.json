    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign risk factors for this person's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female. Age is usually a factor because younger people are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but being female might lower the risk since women tend to have lower recidivism rates than men.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure how ethnicity plays into this, but maybe there are some cultural or socioeconomic factors that could influence her risk. I'll mark this as low for now unless other info changes my mind.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. That's a bit conflicting. An arrest suggests possible involvement in criminal behavior, but no conviction means it didn't result in a charge or she was acquitted. So maybe the risk isn't too high here, so I'll put this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'3\" and 160 lbs. Physical attributes don't really impact recidivism much, so low on that.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living with others could mean support or supervision, which might be protective, but being single without a spouse could also be neutral. I'll rate this as medium because it's more about her current situation than anything else.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor because lower education can lead to fewer job opportunities and higher crime rates. So that should be a high risk factor.\n\nHeld three jobs in the past year. That shows some employment instability. Frequent job changes might indicate issues with maintaining consistent work, which could relate to recidivism. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years but felt down sometimes in the past month. Drug use is a significant risk factor when present, so her abstinence lowers that. However, feeling depressed can be a sign of mental health issues, which might increase recidivism if not addressed. So maybe low for drug use and medium for mental health.\n\nLived in a household of four at a young age. Family environment could have long-term effects, but without more info on the quality of that home life, it's hard to assess. I'll keep this as low.\n\nConsiders God involved in her personal events. Religious involvement is sometimes linked with lower recidivism because it provides structure and support. So I'll mark this as low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: education is high risk, arrest history and mental health are medium, others are low. Predicting rearrest might be on the higher side but not extremely so. Confidence around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old, which is in a high-risk age range for recidivism\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Identifies as Hispanic; no specific risk factor linked to ethnicity alone\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some risk but not definitive criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are non-factors in recidivism prediction\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living with others; may indicate lack of support or supervision\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Held three jobs in the past year, indicating possible instability\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor\"),\n     (\"mental_health_indicators\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down sometimes, suggesting potential mental health issues\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of size 4 at a young age; no specific risk indicated\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events, which may provide support reducing recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
