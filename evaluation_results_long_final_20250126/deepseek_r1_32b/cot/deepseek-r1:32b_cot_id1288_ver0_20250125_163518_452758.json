    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Young adults are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing and facing various life challenges. So, high weight here makes sense.\n\nNext, being male. Statistically, males have higher arrest rates than females. That's a medium factor.\n\nRace as Black: There are systemic issues that can contribute to higher arrest rates, but it's not the only factor. Medium weight again.\n\nNine arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. This is a strong predictor for future rearrests, so high weight here.\n\nHeight and weight (5'11\", 190 lbs) don't typically correlate with recidivism, so low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone can be risk factors because stable relationships often reduce recidivism risk. Medium weight makes sense here.\n\nGED but not in college: Education is a protective factor. Not continuing education might increase risk, so medium weight.\n\nHeld one job in the past year suggests unstable employment, which is linked to higher recidivism. High weight here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) within four years indicates substance issues, which can lead to criminal behavior. Medium weight.\n\nFeeling down for part of the month shows some mental health struggles. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism risk, so medium weight.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and a household size of 4: Urban areas have higher crime rates, but family structure can be protective. It's a bit mixed, so low weight.\n\nBelieves God influences personal events: Spiritual beliefs can be protective against recidivism. Medium weight here.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors are medium or high risk, especially the criminal history and unstable employment. The prediction is YES for rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is a period associated with higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and life challenges.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender correlates with higher arrest rates compared to female gender.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic factors contributing to higher arrest rates, though this varies widely.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"conviction\", \"medium\", \"A prior conviction suggests established patterns of criminal activity and legal involvement.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not typically predictive factors for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married status can be a risk factor as stable relationships often reduce recidivism.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job in the past year suggests unstable employment, linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use indicates substance issues which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression suggest potential mental health challenges linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing and family structure may influence risk, though factors are mixed.\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief in divine influence can be a protective factor against recidivism through community support.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
