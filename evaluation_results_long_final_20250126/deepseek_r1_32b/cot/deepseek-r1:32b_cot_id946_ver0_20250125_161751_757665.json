    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to work through this risk assessment step by step. The person in question is a 22-year-old White female with a history of arrest and conviction. Let me break down each factor provided.\n\nStarting with age: she's 22. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing emotionally and socially. But as they get older, especially into their late twenties and beyond, the likelihood tends to decrease. So a 22-year-old might be in that transitional phase where the risk is moderate.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. Statistically, women have lower rearrest rates compared to men. So this factor would likely be low in terms of contributing to recidivism.\n\nHer race is White. I've read studies indicating that Black and Hispanic individuals often face higher arrest rates and longer sentences than Whites for similar crimes. This could mean that being White might carry a lower risk, so I'll note that as low.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't necessarily high-risk on its own, but it does indicate some level of past behavior that could be a factor. Depending on the nature of the crime, this can vary, but without specifics, I'll consider this medium risk because having a criminal history is a known predictor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 214 lbs. Obesity can lead to health issues which might impact her ability to secure employment or handle stress, potentially increasing recidivism risk. So I think this would be a medium factor.\n\nMarital status: she's separated and living alone. Being separated could indicate some instability, but living alone without dependents might offer more freedom but also less social support. I'm not entirely sure about the impact here, so I'll mark it as low unless there are other factors pointing otherwise.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a GED but isn't in college. A GED is a positive sign of completing high school equivalency, which can help with employment. However, without higher education, job opportunities might be limited, potentially increasing risk. So I'll consider this medium because educational attainment is a key factor, and having only a GED might not provide enough stability.\n\nEmployment: she hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial stress and limited positive activities. This would likely be high risk because without steady employment, there's more idle time and potential for negative influences or activities.\n\nDrug use: she hasn't used drugs in four years but has some recent feelings of depression. While past drug use is a concern, her abstinence suggests some level of control. However, current mental health issues like depression can sometimes be linked to substance misuse if not managed properly. I'll rate this as medium because the recent emotional state might pose a risk, but the lack of recent drug use mitigates that somewhat.\n\nLiving situation: she was raised in a household of nine with non-biological parents. Growing up in a large family or with foster care can sometimes lead to instability or lack of consistent parenting, which might contribute to behavioral issues later on. So I'll consider this as medium risk because such environments can affect emotional and social development.\n\nSpirituality: she believes God plays a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective factors against recidivism by providing a sense of purpose and support. Therefore, this would likely be low risk as it's a positive influence.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks are unemployment (high), followed by age and educational attainment (both medium). The presence of depression also adds to the medium risk category. Other factors like gender, race, and spirituality are lower or protective. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards predicting that she might have a higher chance of rearrest within three years, especially given her unemployment and lack of stable employment history. However, her abstention from drugs and spiritual beliefs could act as mitigating factors. The confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are conflicting, but overall, the medium to high risks suggest a moderate likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals have higher recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"females have lower rearrest rates than males\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face fewer systemic biases compared to other races\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"one arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"obesity can lead to health issues impacting employment and stress management\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"separated and living alone; no dependents but possible instability\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED completed, not enrolled in college; limited job opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"unemployed for a year; linked to higher recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"abstinent for four years but recent depression may pose risks\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"raised in large household with non-biological parents; potential instability\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"belief in God provides protective factors against recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
