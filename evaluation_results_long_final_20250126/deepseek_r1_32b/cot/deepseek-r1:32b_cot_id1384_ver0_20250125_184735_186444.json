    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19 years old. Typically, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates due to factors like impulsivity and lack of maturity. So I'll rate age as high risk.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to males. So this factor would be low risk.\n\nEthnicity is American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. There are disparities in the criminal justice system that might affect this group, potentially leading to higher recidivism. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Previous arrests can sometimes indicate a pattern, even without convictions. This might be a medium risk factor since there's some history of interaction with the law.\n\nMarital status: she's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships often reduce recidivism. This is low risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 140 lbs. These are average measurements and don't indicate any specific risk factors, so low.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of involvement in crime. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nEmployment: held one job during the year. Some stability here, but having only one job might indicate limited work history. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism. This should be high risk.\n\nMental health: felt down in the dumps for some time in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so this is medium risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a rural area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent household might present challenges, but being in a stable environment now could mitigate some risks. I'll rate this as low.\n\nSpirituality: believes God has something to do with personal events. Strong spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism. This is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors pointing towards higher risk are age, ethnicity, previous arrests, drug use, mental health, lack of education, and limited employment. While there are some protective factors like being married, having a stable family background, and spirituality, the presence of several medium to high-risk factors suggests a moderate likelihood of rearrest.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES with a confidence level around 65%. This accounts for both the significant risk factors and the protective elements present in her profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity.\"),\n     (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates than males.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Disparities in the criminal justice system may affect this group.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrests can indicate a pattern, even without convictions.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Stable relationships reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Average measurements don't indicate specific risks.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education may limit opportunities and increase crime involvement.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having only one job indicates limited work history.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse significantly predicts recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"medium\", \"Mental health can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable environment now may mitigate past challenges.\"),\n     (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Strong beliefs provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
