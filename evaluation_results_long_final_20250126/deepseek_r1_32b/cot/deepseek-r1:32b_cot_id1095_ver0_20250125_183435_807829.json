    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nStarting with age: he's 21 years old. Young adults in their early twenties are typically at a higher risk of rearrest compared to older individuals because they're still developing emotionally and socially. So, I'll mark age as high risk.\n\nNext, gender is male. Statistically, males have higher recidivism rates than females. This factor should be considered medium since while it's a known risk factor, individual circumstances can vary.\n\nEthnicity: he identifies as Hispanic. There might be systemic factors contributing to higher arrest rates for this group, but his personal situation doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk beyond that context. So, I'll rate ethnicity as low.\n\nHe has four arrests and one conviction. Having prior convictions is a strong predictor of future offending, so this should definitely be high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 185 lbs. Average size isn't typically linked to recidivism risk. This will stay low.\n\nMarital status: separated and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to lack of social support. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not in college. Education level is a factor; having a diploma isn't as protective as higher education but it's better than none. So, low risk here.\n\nEmployment status: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can increase recidivism risk because of limited opportunities and potential stress. This should be medium.\n\nDrug use: no drugs in four years. This is a positive sign; substance abuse is often linked to crime, so no recent use lowers risk. Low factor here.\n\nMental health: not depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can contribute, his current state seems stable, so low risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in an urban area of six people. Stable family structure might offer some protection against recidivism. This is a medium factor since living in an urban area could have its own risks, but the family environment was supportive.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn't see God's role in personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective, so lack thereof might slightly increase risk. Medium here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high and medium factors like prior convictions, age, gender, unemployment, living alone. However, some low factors balance that, like education, no drug use, stable family background.\n\nI think the overall prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years but not extremely high confidence because there are mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age 21 falls in a high-risk category for recidivism as young adults are more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to female, though individual circumstances can vary.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may face systemic factors but doesn't inherently indicate higher personal risk without additional context.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction strongly predict future offending as prior convictions are a significant risk factor.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight (5'7\\\", 185 lbs) aren't typically linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Separated and living alone can correlate with higher risk due to potential lack of social support.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma provides some protective factor but isn't as strong as higher education against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed for the past year increases risk through limited opportunities and potential stress contributing to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk as substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month indicates stable mental health, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area provides some protection but living in an urban environment can present risks contributing to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's personal influence may slightly increase risk as religious involvement can be protective against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
