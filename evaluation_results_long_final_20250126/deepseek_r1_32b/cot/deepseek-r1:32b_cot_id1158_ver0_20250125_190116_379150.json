    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 21-year-old Hispanic male with several factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are more likely to be involved in criminal activities because they might still be developing socially and economically. So, I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHispanic ethnicity\u2014some studies show that minority groups may face systemic issues or over-policing, which could lead to higher arrest rates. That's a medium factor too.\n\nHe has been arrested seven times but no convictions yet. Frequent arrests without convictions might indicate ongoing legal troubles without definitive outcomes, so I think high here because it shows recurring involvement with the law.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. Not sure if this directly affects recidivism. Maybe physical stature could influence certain crimes, but not a strong factor. Low risk.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living arrangements can affect stability. Being single and not living alone might mean less supervision or different social dynamics, so medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is protective against recidivism because it offers more opportunities. High for positive influence.\n\nHeld one job in the past year. Employment is good but holding only one job might indicate limited work history or challenges finding stable employment. Medium risk.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if not severe, can correlate with higher recidivism rates. Medium factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues are a concern, so no depression is positive. High for protective effect.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 4 at a young age. Family structure during upbringing can influence behavior. Stable family environment might be protective. Medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism. High as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has several high and medium risk factors but also strong protective ones like education, religious belief, no depression. The high arrest count without conviction is a significant concern. I'm leaning towards predicting rearrest as YES but with moderate confidence because while there are risks, there are also mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age: 21\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have higher rates of recidivism due to ongoing development and instability.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity: Hispanic\", \"medium\", \"Minority groups may face systemic issues impacting arrest rates.\"),\n     (\"Arrests without Conviction: 7 times\", \"high\", \"Frequent arrests suggest recurring legal involvement despite no convictions.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight: 6'2\\\", 215 lbs\", \"low\", \"Physical stature may have minimal impact on recidivism unless specific to crime type.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status: Never married, not living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living arrangements can affect social stability and supervision.\"),\n     (\"Education: High school diploma, enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Higher education is protective against recidivism by offering opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Employment: Held one job\", \"medium\", \"Limited work history may indicate challenges in maintaining stable employment.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use: Marijuana past 4 years\", \"medium\", \"Substance use can correlate with higher rearrest rates, though not severe here.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health: No depression past month\", \"high\", \"Absence of depression is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Family Background: Lived with mother in household of 4\", \"medium\", \"Stable early family environment might offer protection from recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief: Believes God influences his life\", \"high\", \"Strong religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
