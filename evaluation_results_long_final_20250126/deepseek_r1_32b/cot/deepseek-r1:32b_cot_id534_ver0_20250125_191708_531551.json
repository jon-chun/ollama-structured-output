    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old Black male over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age at first arrest is 20. Typically, younger individuals might be considered higher risk because they're still developing and may engage in more impulsive behavior. But he's already 20, which is on the older side for first-time arrests, so maybe that's a medium factor. I think being older can sometimes indicate higher responsibility but not always.\n\nNext, race: Black males are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, so this might be a high risk factor due to systemic biases and discrimination that affect their interactions with law enforcement.\n\nSex is male, which statistically has a higher rearrest rate than female. So I'll mark that as medium.\n\nHe's arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could indicate either that the charges were dropped or he was acquitted. This might suggest some risk because an arrest happened, but no conviction could mean it wasn't a serious offense. Maybe medium here.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'0\" and 160 lbs. He's within average range; nothing stands out about his physical characteristics that would indicate higher risk. So low.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Unmarried status and living alone can sometimes correlate with lower social support, which might be a medium factor for rearrest risk because he doesn't have the same level of supervision or support as someone in a family unit.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education is important; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his job prospects. That could lead to financial stress, which might contribute to medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job stability can be a protective factor against recidivism. But holding only two jobs in a year doesn't show strong long-term stability, so maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a significant factor. Even if it's not heavy or illegal now (since marijuana may be legal), past use can indicate potential for substance-related issues that might lead to rearrests. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nMental health: He felt down in the past month, which could indicate depression or anxiety. Mental health issues are linked with higher recidivism rates because they can affect decision-making and coping mechanisms. This is a high factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Stable family upbringing is protective against recidivism. So this would be low risk.\n\nReligious involvement: Believes God has a role in his life. Religious affiliation can provide support and reduce engagement in risky behaviors, so that's a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors point to medium or high risks, especially race, mental health, substance use, and living alone. However, he has some protective factors like education, family background, and religious beliefs. The confidence is moderate because while there are risk factors, the protective ones might mitigate some of the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, this individual falls within a moderate-risk age range for rearrest, as younger individuals may still be developing decision-making skills and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black males are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, which can influence systemic biases and increased surveillance, leading to higher rearrest risks.\"),\n     (\"sex\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is associated with statistically higher rates of rearrest compared to female counterparts, due to factors like societal expectations and behavioral patterns.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted suggests potential risk, though the absence of a conviction may indicate less severe underlying issues or external circumstances.\"),\n     (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight within average ranges do not significantly contribute to rearrest risk, as physical attributes are less influential compared to behavioral and socioeconomic factors.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can reduce social support networks, which may increase vulnerability to negative influences or stressors that could lead to rearrest\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Possessing a high school diploma provides a foundation for employment but lacks the additional protective benefits of higher education against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs in a year may indicate some level of job-hopping or instability, though it doesn't necessarily correlate directly with rearrest risk without further context on job tenure and roles\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use within the last four years suggests potential substance involvement that could lead to legal issues if continued or escalated, posing a moderate risk factor for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Reporting feelings of depression in the past month highlights significant mental health concerns.
