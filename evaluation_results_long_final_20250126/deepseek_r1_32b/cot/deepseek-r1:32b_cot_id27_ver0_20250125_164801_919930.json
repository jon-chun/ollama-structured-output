    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Research shows that younger adults are more likely to recidivate because they might still be developing emotionally and socially. So, I'll mark age as high risk.\n\nShe's female. Studies indicate that women tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to men. This could be due to various factors like socialization or different types of crimes. So, gender gets a low risk rating.\n\nEthnicity is White. Racial disparities in the criminal justice system mean that people from certain groups might face more scrutiny, but I don't see strong evidence here directly linking race to higher recidivism without other factors. Maybe medium, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's possible this factor isn't as significant on its own. Hmm.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest can sometimes indicate a brush with the law, but no conviction might mean either she wasn't guilty or charges were dropped. This is a bit ambiguous, so I'll consider it medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'4\" and 139 lbs. These physical attributes don't have a direct link to recidivism that I'm aware of, so low risk here.\n\nNever married, currently living alone. Living situation can affect stability. Being single and alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nGED but not in college. She has some education, which is protective, but not pursuing higher education could limit opportunities. So, this is a medium risk.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally positive, but holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or inability to maintain consistent employment, so medium risk here too.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to sustain drug habits. Plus, recent drug use (past month) increases this risk. High risk factor.\n\nDepression symptoms: feeling down all the time for the past month. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates as they can impair judgment and coping skills. High risk here.\n\nFamily background: grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing is protective, so low risk on this factor.\n\nReligious belief: considers God influential. Religious involvement often correlates with lower crime rates due to moral guidelines and community support. Low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several high-risk factors related to substance abuse and mental health. Medium risks include past arrest, living situation, education, and employment. The protective factors like age, gender, family background, and religious beliefs might mitigate some of the higher risks but probably not enough given the strong predictors present.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has a moderate risk of rearrest within three years due to significant substance abuse and mental health issues, despite having some protective factors.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are more likely to recidivate\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Women have lower rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Unclear impact without additional context\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest with no conviction is ambiguous\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"No direct link to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED but not in college limits opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs indicate instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and past use of illicit drugs\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Persistent depressive symptoms\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement may reduce crime\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
