    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit new to criminal justice risk assessment, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate each of the given risk factors for the individual described. The person is a 21-year-old male, White, arrested three times with convictions. He's 6'0\", 210 lbs, never married, living alone. High school diploma but not in college. Held two jobs in the past year. Used marijuana in the last four years, no depression in the past month. Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area of size four. Believes God has a role in his life.\n\nI'll go through each factor one by one and assign a low, medium, or high weight based on how much they might contribute to rearrest within three years.\n\n1. **Age (21):** Research shows that younger individuals are more likely to recidivate because of factors like impulsivity and lack of life experience. So this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\n2. **Gender (Male):** Statistically, males are more likely than females to be rearrested. This should be a high weight since it's a strong predictive factor.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity (White):** I'm not as sure about this one. Some studies suggest that minorities might face higher surveillance, but in terms of recidivism rates, White individuals might sometimes have different patterns. It could be low or medium. Maybe low since it's less directly linked compared to other factors.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests (3):** Having multiple arrests indicates a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This should definitely be high as three is more than the typical first-time offender.\n\n5. **Conviction History:** Having been convicted means there's a history of criminal behavior, which increases the likelihood of future offenses. High weight here.\n\n6. **Height and Weight (6'0\", 210 lbs):** Not sure about this one. Maybe not directly related unless considering factors like being more intimidating or physically capable. I might rate this low since it's less relevant to criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Marital Status (Never Married, Living Alone):** Being single and living alone can sometimes correlate with lower social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Medium weight here.\n\n8. **Education (High School Diploma, Not in College):** Education level is a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Since he's only at high school and not continuing, this could be medium or high. Maybe medium since some have high school but manage well without college.\n\n9. **Employment History (2 Jobs in the Past Year):** Holding jobs can indicate stability, but having multiple might suggest inconsistency. It could go either way. I'd say low because it's about holding a job rather than being unemployed, which is more risky.\n\n10. **Drug Use (Marijuana in Last Four Years):** Drug use, especially marijuana, can be a sign of potential substance abuse issues that might lead to criminal behavior. Medium weight since it's not as severe as harder drugs but still a factor.\n\n11. **Depression Symptoms (None in Past Month):** Lack of depression is positive; mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates. So this should be low or maybe even protective, so low.\n\n12. **Family Background (Both Biological Parents, Urban Area, Household Size 4):** Growing up with both parents usually is a protective factor. However, urban areas might have more exposure to crime. It's a bit conflicting. Maybe medium because it's somewhat mixed.\n\n13. **Religious Beliefs (Believes God Influences His Life):** Religious involvement can be protective against recidivism as it provides structure and support. This should be low as a risk factor since it's a positive influence.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the person has several high-risk factors: male gender, three arrests, convictions. Medium factors include age, drug use, living alone. Low or protective factors are race, education, employment, depression status, family background, religious beliefs.\n\nConsidering all this, the prediction leans towards a higher risk of rearrest. The confidence isn't extremely high because there are some protective factors like religion and no depression, but the presence of multiple high-risk factors suggests a likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"high\", \"Statistically, males are more likely to be rearrested than females.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"Less directly linked compared to other factors.\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests (3)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a potential pattern of behavior leading to rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"History of criminal behavior increases future likelihood.\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight (6'0\\\", 210 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Less relevant to criminal behavior unless considering physical factors.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never Married, Living Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Lower social support may increase risk of reoffending.\"),\n     (\"Education (High School Diploma, Not in College)\", \"medium\", \"Higher education correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"Employment History (2 Jobs in the Past Year)\", \"low\", \"Holding jobs indicates some stability but might suggest inconsistency.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in Last Four Years)\", \"medium\", \"Signifies potential substance abuse issues that might lead to crime.\"),\n     (\"Depression Symptoms (None in Past Month)\", \"low\", \"Positive mental health reduces risk of recidivism\"),\n     (\"Family Background (Both Biological Parents, Urban Area, Household Size 4)\", \"medium\", \"Mixed impact due to both protective and urban factors.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs (Believes God Influences His Life)\", \"low\", \"Provides structure and support reducing recidivism likelihood.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
