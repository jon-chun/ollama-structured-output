    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this individual recidivating within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From what I know, younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior again because they're still developing and might not have stable lives yet. So, age being low means it's a minor risk factor here.\n\nNext, gender is male. Studies show that males are more likely to commit crimes than females. This isn't a huge factor on its own, but combined with others, it could increase the risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nEthnicity is Hispanic. There might be some systemic issues or socioeconomic factors affecting this group, leading to higher arrest rates. But ethnicity alone isn't a strong predictor, so I'll assign low weight here.\n\nArrest count is two times with a conviction. Having prior convictions is a significant factor because past behavior can indicate future actions. This should definitely be high on the list of risk factors.\n\nWeight is 140 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe if someone is underweight or has health issues, but 140 seems average. So, low weight here.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Not being in a committed relationship might mean less social support, which can increase the risk of reoffending. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is linked to higher crime rates because it limits job opportunities. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment status: held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and limited legal ways to earn money, making recidivism more likely. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior, especially if it's ongoing or leads to other illegal activities. High risk factor.\n\nDepression: hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this might lower the risk slightly. I'll mark this as low.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family environment plays a role, but without specific issues mentioned, it's hard to assess. So, medium weight here.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God unrelated to personal events. Lack of religious involvement might mean less moral guidance or community support, which could increase the risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNow, putting all these together. Most of the factors are either high or medium. The individual has prior convictions, lacks education and employment, uses drugs, and doesn't have strong social supports. These are significant red flags. On the other hand, he's not currently depressed, which is a slight positive, but overall, the high-risk factors outweigh that.\n\nI think predicting rearrest within three years as YES makes sense here. The confidence isn't 100% because there are some low factors, like ethnicity and age, but given the strong indicators like prior convictions, drug use, and lack of education and employment, I'd say around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old.
