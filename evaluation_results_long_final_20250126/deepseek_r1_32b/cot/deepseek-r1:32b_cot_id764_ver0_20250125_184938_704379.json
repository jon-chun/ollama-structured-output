    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a known risk factor in recidivism studies. He\u2019s 18, which is quite young. Younger offenders are more likely to reoffend because they're still developing socially and emotionally. So I\u2019d say high weight on this factor.\n\nNext, gender. He's male, and males tend to have higher rates of rearrest compared to females. That's another high-weight factor.\n\nRace might influence the risk, but White individuals don't typically fall into a higher-risk category in most datasets. So low weight here.\n\nHe\u2019s been arrested once and convicted. Having a conviction is significant because it shows that he has already engaged in criminal behavior that led to a conviction. This should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHeight and weight\u20146'2\" and 210 lbs. I don't recall height being a major risk factor, but maybe the weight could indicate potential for certain types of crimes. Still, not a strong indicator, so low weight.\n\nNever married, living alone. Marital status can affect recidivism; being single might increase risk because there's less social support. High-weight factor here.\n\nEnrolled in school currently. Education is protective; people who are in school have more structured lives and may be less likely to reoffend. Low weight because it's a positive factor, but he still has other high-risk factors.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having some work history is good. Medium weight since it\u2019s not full-time or long-term necessarily.\n\nDrug use in past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because drug involvement often correlates with criminal behavior. High weight here.\n\nNo depression over the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so no depression might be protective. Low weight.\n\nLived with biological mother in urban area as a child. Family structure and environment can influence outcomes. Growing up in an urban area might expose him to more crime opportunities, but this is somewhat situational. Medium weight.\n\nNo religious affiliation; God has nothing to do with his personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism. So no affiliation might be a risk factor, medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors are either high or medium weight, especially age, gender, prior conviction, living situation, and drug use. The protective factors like being in school and not currently depressed might lower the overall risk, but the presence of multiple high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I\u2019d predict a YES with maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals are more likely to reoffend as they develop socially.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have higher rearrest rates than females.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals typically don't fall into a high-risk category for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"prior arrest/conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of conviction indicates past criminal behavior leading to reoffending.\"),\n     (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Height isn't a major risk factor, though weight might suggest certain crime types.\"),\n     (\"marital status/living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, increasing rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"education (currently enrolled)\", \"low\", \"Education provides structure, potentially reducing recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Part-time work may offer some protective effects against reoffending.\"),\n     (\"substance abuse history\", \"high\", \"Drug use correlates with criminal behavior and higher rearrest rates.\"),\n     (\"mental health status (depression)\", \"low\", \"Lack of depression might provide some protective effect against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"family structure/upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to crime, but not a primary risk factor.\"),\n     (\"religious affiliation\", \"medium\", \"No religious involvement might reduce protective factors against reoffending.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
