    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. That\u2019s a bit young, but not extremely so. Younger individuals might be more prone to recidivism because they're still developing and establishing themselves in society. I think this should be medium.\n\nNext, being male. Studies show that males are more likely to be rearrested than females. So, male is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nRace as White. While there can be disparities in the criminal justice system, without specific context on how race interacts here, it's probably low risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests can indicate some level of involvement in illegal activities, even if not leading to conviction. This should be medium because multiple arrests might suggest a pattern or inclination towards such behavior.\n\nCurrently living alone and never married. Living alone can sometimes lead to less supervision or support, which might increase risk. Being single doesn't directly correlate as much, but combined with living alone, it's medium.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment. Education is a protective factor. Having only a high school diploma might limit opportunities, so this is medium.\n\nHeld one job in the past year. Stable employment is good, but holding just one job could indicate limited work history or potential for instability. I'd rate this as low risk because having a job is positive.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's a strong protective factor. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates, so no recent use means low risk here.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so not being depressed lowers the risk, making this another low.\n\nRaised in an urban area with both parents in a household of four. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective, so that's low risk.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce risky behaviors, which is a positive factor. So, this is also low.\n\nPutting it all together: high for being male, medium for age, arrests, living alone, education, and one job; low for others. The prediction leans towards YES with moderate confidence because of the higher risk factors like gender and arrest history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is young but not extremely so; younger individuals may be more prone to recidivism\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male individuals are statistically more likely to be rearrested than females\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic disparities, but this factor alone doesn't indicate high risk without additional context\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests suggest potential inclination towards illegal activities despite no convictions\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to less supervision and support, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married doesn't directly correlate but combined with living alone may contribute moderately\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma limits opportunities compared to higher education; protective factor is present\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding one job indicates some stability, which reduces recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently reduces the risk associated with mental health issues\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a stable family environment is protective\"),\n     (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing God influences life can provide support and reduce risky behaviors\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
