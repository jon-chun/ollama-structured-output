    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be exploring their identities and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, being female also generally has a lower rearrest rate compared to males, so that might counterbalance the age factor a bit. I think this would be a medium risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes influence interactions with law enforcement, but it's not a direct indicator of recidivism. So maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest could indicate some level of involvement in the criminal justice system, even if there was no conviction. This might suggest some risk, so I'd consider this medium.\n\nHer height is 5'10\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. Physical characteristics aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Relationship status can sometimes be a factor; being single might mean less social support. However, she's enrolled in graduate school, which suggests she has other support structures. Maybe medium risk because of the lack of marriage but offset by education.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in a graduate program. Education is usually a protective factor against recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and stability. That would be low risk.\n\nHeld three jobs in the past year. Job instability might indicate some challenges with maintaining employment, which could be linked to higher stress or financial issues. This could contribute to medium risk.\n\nUsed marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance use is a significant factor because it can impair judgment and lead to behaviors that result in arrest. I think this should be high risk since both drugs are illicit and their use can directly relate to legal troubles.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with recidivism, but she's not currently depressed. So low risk here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective. However, living in an urban area might mean higher crime rates or more opportunities for arrest. I think this could be medium because the positive family environment might offset some urban risks.\n\nConsiders God has something to do with her personally. Religious involvement can sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism risk. So low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are either medium or high, especially substance use which is a major red flag. The educational background and lack of depression are protective. Overall, I think the prediction leans towards YES for rearrest within three years with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may increase risk due to potential for risky behavior.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race generally has a low direct impact on recidivism predictions.\"),\n     (\"prior arrest\", \"medium\", \"Single prior arrest without conviction indicates some system interaction.\"),\n     (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone may affect social support.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and graduate studies are protective factors.\"),\n     (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs in a year suggest potential instability.\"),\n     (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent illicit drug use is a significant risk factor.\"),\n     (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No depression indicates better mental well-being.\"),\n     (\"family environment\", \"medium\", \"Stable upbringing but urban living may affect risk.\"),\n     (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide support against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
