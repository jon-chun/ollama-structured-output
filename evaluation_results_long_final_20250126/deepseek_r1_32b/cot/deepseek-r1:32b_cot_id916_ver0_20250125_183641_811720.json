    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the risk factors for a 21-year-old male's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Younger individuals are often more involved in criminal activity because of impulsivity and lack of maturity. So, I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nRace is White. While there might be some correlation due to systemic factors, it's not a direct indicator of recidivism. So, low risk here.\n\nGender is male. Statistically, males are more likely than females to be rearrested. Medium risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction can still indicate some propensity towards criminal behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 160 lbs. These are average stats, so no impact on risk. Low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living with others might provide some supervision or accountability, but being single could mean less stability. Maybe a medium risk here because it's a bit of both.\n\nEducation: Associate degree completed, not enrolled. Higher education can reduce recidivism, so this is protective. Low risk.\n\nEmployment: Held two jobs in the year. Steady employment is a positive factor. Low risk.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of rearrest. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so absence is good. Low risk.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing can be protective. Low risk.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has nothing to do with his life. Lack of religious involvement might not directly correlate but could indicate other factors. Medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risks from age and drug use are strong indicators. The protective factors like education and employment help, but substance abuse is a major red flag. So, I predict a YES for rearrest with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age 21 falls into a higher risk category due to potential impulsivity and lack of maturity which can increase criminal tendencies.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"While race can sometimes be correlated with systemic factors, it is not a direct indicator of recidivism and thus carries low risk weight in this context.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males statistically have higher rates of rearrest compared to females, contributing to a medium risk factor here.\"),\n     (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted suggests some potential for criminal behavior despite no conviction, hence a medium risk weight.\"),\n     (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism rates, leading to a low risk factor here.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married can sometimes correlate with less social stability which may contribute to higher risks, hence medium risk weight.\"),\n     (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently not living alone but the exact nature of cohabitation is unspecified; however, this generally offers some supervision and accountability, leading to low risk here.\"),\n     (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having completed an associate degree provides a protective factor against recidivism, hence low risk weight.\"),\n     (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year indicates stable employment which is a protective factor, contributing to a low risk here.\"),\n     (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine within the last four years is a significant predictor of rearrest due to substance abuse correlation with criminal activity, hence high risk weight here.\"),\n     (\"mental health status\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month suggests good mental health which can be protective against recidivism, contributing to low risk here.\"),\n     (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a stable household with both biological parents provides a protective factor against recidivism, hence low risk weight here.\"),\n     (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal events can sometimes correlate with lower social support and thus contribute to medium risk here.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
