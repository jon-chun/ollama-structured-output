    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest within three years. Let me break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female. Age is a factor here because younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but females tend to have lower arrest rates compared to males. So I'd say age has a medium impact on her risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. Racial factors can sometimes influence interactions with the justice system, but without more context, it's hard to assign a high weight here. Maybe low or medium.\n\nShe's been arrested four times but hasn't been convicted yet. This is significant because multiple arrests suggest some level of involvement in illegal activities, even without convictions. I think this should be a high-risk factor.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145'4\" and 110 lbs\u2014are probably not major risk factors on their own, so low impact.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living arrangements can affect behavior; being with others might provide support but could also limit freedom. Not sure if this is medium or low. I'll go with medium because having a stable living situation can influence behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without education, job opportunities are limited, increasing the risk. High impact here.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Having employment is positive, so this should be a low-risk factor as it reduces the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major predictor of criminal behavior. This is definitely high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she isn't depressed now, this might be low impact.\n\nLived with her mother in an urban area as a child. Family dynamics and environment play a role. Growing up in an urban area could mean higher crime exposure, so medium risk here.\n\nBelieves God influences personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism, so this would be low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: she has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, drug use, lack of education, and some mediums like age and living situation. The positives are her employment and spiritual beliefs. Considering these, I think the prediction leans towards rearrest, with a moderate confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old, younger individuals may be more prone to recidivism\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White, no significant correlation without additional context\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"4 arrests indicate potential involvement in illegal activities\"),\n     (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"5'4\\\" and 110 lbs, not indicative of risk on their own\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living situation may influence behavior\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED limits job opportunities, increasing risk\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs in the past year, positive factor\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance issues\"),\n     (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently, protective factor\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to higher crime rates\"),\n     (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence can act as a protective factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
