    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for a 19-year-old male within three years based on the given information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, gender: he's male. I remember that males are more likely to be involved in criminal activities compared to females. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nAge at first arrest: he was 19 when arrested once but not convicted. Since he hasn't been convicted before, maybe the impact isn't as strong. But being arrested at a young age could still indicate some risk. I'll mark this as medium because it's somewhat concerning but not the highest.\n\nEthnicity is White. From what I know, ethnicity itself isn't a direct predictor of recidivism, but systemic factors might influence arrest rates differently. So low impact here.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\" and 155 lbs. Not sure how this affects risk. Maybe if someone is underweight or very large, it could relate to substance use or health issues. But for now, I'll say low because there's no direct link evident.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Unmarried individuals might have less social support, which can be a risk factor. Medium impact since living alone doesn't necessarily mean high risk but does reduce potential protective factors.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides skills and opportunities. So this is a low-risk factor or even protective.\n\nEmployment history: held one job in the past year. Stable employment can be protective, but holding only one job might not indicate enough stability yet. I'll rate this as medium because while having a job is good, limited work history could mean some instability.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's ongoing or problematic. Medium impact since it's not severe but still concerning.\n\nMental health: has felt down in the past month. Depression can lead to substance abuse or other behaviors that increase criminal risk. This is medium because mental health issues are significant but depend on severity and treatment.\n\nFamily structure growing up: lived with both parents in a rural area of five people. Stable family background is protective, so this is low impact as it reduces the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God important. Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism. Low impact since it's a positive factor but not the strongest predictor alone.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are medium or low. The high-risk factor is gender, but others like drug use and mental health add to the risk. However, protective factors like education and family background might mitigate some of these risks. So I'm leaning towards predicting no rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities.\"),\n     (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Being arrested at 19 years old and not convicted is a moderate risk factor as it indicates some interaction with the justice system without leading to conviction, which might suggest potential for future encounters but less so than a conviction history.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity_white\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not significantly predict recidivism; however, systemic factors may influence arrest rates differently across ethnic groups.\"),\n     (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with rearrest risk unless indicative of health issues that might impact behavior or opportunities, which is not the case here.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_single\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone can be associated with lower social support networks, which may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors without the mitigating influence of a spouse or family cohabitation.\"),\n     (\"education_high_school_plus_college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is protective against rearrest as higher education correlates with better job opportunities and lower engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n     (\"employment_history_one_job\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the past year suggests some level of employment stability, which can be protective against rearrest.
