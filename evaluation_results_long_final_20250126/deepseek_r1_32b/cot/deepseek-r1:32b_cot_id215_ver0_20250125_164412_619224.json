    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual within three years. Let's start by breaking down each factor given.\n\nFirst, age is 19. I remember that younger individuals, especially in their late teens, are often at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or environmental factors. So, I'll note this as high risk.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. From what I know, women tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to men. They're often involved in different types of crimes and may respond differently to interventions. This should be a low risk factor.\n\nRace is White. There's some evidence that racial minorities might face systemic issues affecting their recidivism rates, but for Whites, the risk factors might not be as pronounced unless other variables are present. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Having prior arrests increases the likelihood of future arrests because it shows a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 130 lbs. These are average stats, and I don't see any direct correlation between body size and recidivism unless there's an issue like obesity leading to health problems, which isn't mentioned here. So, low risk.\n\nMarital status is never married and not living alone. Living with others might provide some support but could also mean exposure to negative influences if the household has issues. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, so I'll go with medium risk.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not in college. Education level can be protective\u2014higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. However, she's only at high school level and not pursuing further education, which might limit her opportunities. This should be medium risk.\n\nEmployment history: held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor because steady work can reduce criminal behavior. So, this is medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism. The presence of drug use suggests she might be struggling with addiction, increasing the chance of rearrest, especially if drugs are involved in her previous offenses. High risk here.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. That's positive because mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. So, low risk for this factor.\n\nFamily background: lived in a household of five at a young age. Larger family size isn't inherently bad, but it could indicate potential overcrowding or lack of attention, which might have contributed to behavioral issues. However, without more info, I'll consider this as medium risk because family environment can play a role in development.\n\nReligious beliefs: God has nothing to do with her personal events. Studies show that individuals who are religiously involved tend to have lower recidivism rates, so the lack of belief might be a risk factor. Medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards higher risk, especially prior convictions and drug use. The confidence is high because these are significant predictors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youth at 19 years old may still be developing decision-making skills, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Whites may face fewer systemic issues affecting recidivism compared to minorities\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern potentially leading to reoffending\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight, no direct correlation with recidivism noted\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone may offer support or exposure to negative influences\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may limit opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, a potential risk factor\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk due to possible addiction or involvement in drug-related crimes\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported reduces mental health-related recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Larger family size at young age may have contributed to behavioral issues\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement may increase recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
