    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Black male over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a big one. He's 19, which is relatively young. Studies show that younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior, but as they get older, that tends to decrease. So I'd say this is a medium risk factor because while he's young, his age alone isn't the highest risk.\n\nNext, race. He identifies as Black. There's a lot of systemic issues here, and unfortunately, Black individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. This can lead to more arrests regardless of actual behavior. So this is probably a medium factor too.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. That's significant. More prior arrests generally mean higher risk, but since he only has one conviction, maybe it's not as high as someone with multiple convictions. I'm thinking this is a high risk factor because repeat offenders are more likely to reoffend.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, no particular issues here. So low risk.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes mean less supervision or support, which might increase the chance of recidivism. This is probably a medium factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Since he only has a high school diploma, that's a medium risk.\n\nEmployment: He held one job during the year. Having stable employment can reduce the likelihood of reoffending, so this is low risk. But it's only one job over a year; maybe it's not consistent enough? Hmm, I'm leaning towards low but could argue for medium if the job isn't steady.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down some days recently. Drug use can be a trigger for criminal behavior, especially if he's struggling with mental health. This is probably a high risk factor because substance use often correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nUpbringing: He was adopted and lived in an urban area with three other people. Family environment is important, but since it's adoptive, I don't have info on that specific family dynamics. Urban areas can have more crime exposure, so maybe medium here.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't think God affects his life. Religious involvement sometimes predicts lower recidivism, so not having that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are prior arrests/convictions and drug use. Mediums include age, race, living alone, education, upbringing, and religion. The low ones are height/weight and employment. So overall, I think the prediction is YES with a confidence around 75% because of those strong high-risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, he is in a higher risk age group for recidivism, but his age alone does not indicate the highest risk.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, which can influence rearrest rates due to systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction suggest a pattern of behavior that may increase the likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support can increase vulnerability to negative influences and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment may limit opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job in the past year suggests some level of stability, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use and recent feelings of depression can indicate substance-related issues that may lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Upbringing/Early Life Environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with adoptive parents may influence exposure to certain risk factors, though specifics are unclear.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in a higher power may reduce protective factors associated with religious involvement that can deter recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
