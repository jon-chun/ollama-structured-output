    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which falls into the young adult category. Research shows that younger individuals, especially in their early twenties, are more likely to be involved in criminal activities. So I'll mark this as medium risk because while they're not in the peak crime years of late teens, they still have a higher likelihood compared to older adults.\n\nNext, race is Black. There's significant evidence of systemic biases and disparities in the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect Black individuals. This factor definitely contributes to a higher recidivism rate, so I'll assign high risk here.\n\nGender is male. Statistically, males are more likely than females to be rearrested, especially for violent crimes. However, this isn't as strong a predictor as other factors like age or race, so medium seems appropriate.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction, even if it's just one, can increase the likelihood of future arrests due to factors like criminal record stigmatization and potential supervision conditions. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHeight is 5'5\" and weight is 145 lbs. These are average measurements for his age group, so there's no indication here that would influence recidivism either positively or negatively. Low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Studies suggest that being unmarried can correlate with higher crime rates, possibly due to less social support. But since he's young and single, this might not be as significant a factor yet. So I'll go with medium here.\n\nEducation level is lacking a high school diploma or GED, and no college enrollment. Low education is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and can lead to cycles of poverty and crime. High risk.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs in the past year. This shows some stability, but only two jobs might not be enough to indicate long-term employability or financial stability. Medium risk since consistent work could help reduce recidivism, but two jobs aren't a strong indicator yet.\n\nDrug use: none in the past four years. That's positive because substance abuse is linked to higher crime rates and recidivism. Low risk here.\n\nMental health: felt down some of the time in the past month. While this isn't severe depression, persistent low mood can affect decision-making and coping mechanisms, potentially increasing criminal behavior. Medium risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in an urban area of four people. Family structure doesn't show any immediate red flags like abuse or neglect, but living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime environments. However, this factor is more about context rather than a direct risk indicator, so low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism by providing support and purpose. So medium because it's not a guarantee but could help reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are race, prior conviction, education level, and low education. Medium risks include age, gender, marital status, employment, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. The low ones are height/weight, drug use, and urban upbringing.\n\nConsidering these, the individual has several significant risk factors that suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. However, protective factors like no recent drug use and some employment history might slightly mitigate this. Overall, I'd predict a YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21-year-old male in early adulthood, associated with higher crime rates compared to older adults\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals face systemic biases increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males statistically more likely to be rearrested than females\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Convicted once, which can lead to stigmatization and supervision issues\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average measurements not influencing risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may lack social support\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED limits opportunities, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs, showing some stability but not strong indicator\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No use in past four years, reducing substance-related risks\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Persistent low mood can affect decision-making and coping\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Raised with mother in urban area without immediate red flags\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believes God is involved, which can provide support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
