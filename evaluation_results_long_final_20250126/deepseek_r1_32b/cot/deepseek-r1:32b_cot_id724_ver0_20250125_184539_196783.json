    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is a known predictor of recidivism. The person is 21, which falls in the high-risk category since younger individuals are more likely to reoffend.\n\nNext, gender: he's male. Studies show males have higher recidivism rates than females, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHis race is white. While there can be disparities, being white doesn't inherently mean low risk. But compared to other groups with higher risks, it might be considered low here.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. High number of arrests and prior convictions are strong indicators for recidivism, so this gets a high weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 150-174 lbs. These are average measurements, not indicative of risk, so low impact.\n\nMarital status is never married. Unmarried individuals tend to have higher rearrest rates, making this a medium factor.\n\nLiving alone could be a risk as social support is lower. So medium weight here.\n\nEducation: He has a GED but isn't in college. Some education reduces risk, but not completing higher ed might increase it slightly, so low-medium.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs in the past year. Stable employment lowers risk, so this is a positive factor\u2014low impact.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is linked to recidivism, especially if it's ongoing or problematic, so medium weight.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently. Mental health issues can increase risk when present, but since he isn't feeling depressed now, that's low.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological dad in a 4-person household. Stable upbringing might lower risk, so low impact here.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't see God as influencing his life. Lack of religious involvement is sometimes linked to higher risks, but this varies, so low weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the high and medium factors suggest a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest. I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Individual is 21 years old, which falls into a higher risk category for recidivism as younger individuals are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is associated with higher rates of recidivism compared to female gender, making this a medium risk factor.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race does not inherently indicate low risk but is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other groups in some contexts, thus considered a low risk factor here.\"),\n     (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Eight prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest due to established patterns of criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not contribute meaningfully to recidivism risk, making this a low impact factor.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married status is associated with higher rearrest rates as individuals without spousal support may face greater challenges in maintaining stability.\"),\n     (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be a risk factor due to potential lack of social support and increased opportunities for criminal behavior, thus medium weight.\"),\n     (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Possessing a GED reduces recidivism risk compared to those without high school education, though not being enrolled in college may slightly increase risk, making this a low-medium factor.\"),\n     (\"employment status\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some stability, which can reduce recidivism risk, thus low weight here.\"),\n     (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use indicates potential substance involvement, which is linked to higher recidivism rates, making this a medium factor.\"),\n     (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms suggest better mental health, which can lower recidivism risk, thus low impact here.\"),\n     (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological dad in a household of size four suggests some stability during upbringing, potentially lowering risk, making this a low factor.\"),\n     (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing God has no influence may indicate lack of religious involvement, which sometimes correlates with higher risks but varies widely, thus low weight here.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
