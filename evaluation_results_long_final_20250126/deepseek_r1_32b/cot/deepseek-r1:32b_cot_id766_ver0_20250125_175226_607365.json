    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for rearrest recidivism within three years for this individual. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female. Age is usually a factor because younger individuals might still be maturing and are at higher risk for reoffending. But females generally have lower recidivism rates than males. So maybe her gender and age balance out somewhat, but I'll note that being young could still pose some risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes be a proxy for other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues, but in terms of direct risk, it's not the strongest factor on its own. So I'd probably rate race as low unless there are context-specific issues, which don't seem present here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s one prior conviction. Having any criminal history does increase rearrest chances, but since this is just a single offense, it might not be the highest risk. But having a conviction can still influence future behavior or opportunities, so I think medium makes sense here.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 155 lbs. Physical characteristics don't typically play into risk assessments unless there's something unusual like extreme underweight or health issues. So both of these factors would be low.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Being in a stable marital relationship is actually protective against recidivism because it often provides support, accountability, and reduces involvement in risky behaviors. That\u2019s definitely a positive factor, so I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can influence job prospects and overall stability. A high school diploma is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities. However, she does have two jobs during the year, which shows some level of responsibility and engagement with employment. So maybe educational status is medium because while it's positive, there's room for improvement in terms of further education.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent or frequent. Marijuana isn't as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs, but any substance use can indicate potential issues with impulsivity or coping mechanisms. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo depression over the past month. Mental health is crucial because untreated depression can lead to other issues like substance abuse or criminal behavior. Since she's not currently depressed, that\u2019s a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nShe grew up in a rural area with her biological mother in a household of five. Family background and upbringing can influence behavior. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally positive. However, living in a rural area might limit access to services or opportunities, but without more context on the community's crime rate, it's hard to say. I'll consider this as low risk since the family structure seems stable.\n\nShe considers God important in her personal life. Religious involvement can provide a support system and reduce participation in risky behaviors. This is another protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: she has some medium risks like prior conviction and substance use, but several protective factors like being married, having a high school diploma, no depression, stable family background, and religious beliefs. The protective factors probably outweigh the medium risks, leading me to predict that her rearrest recidivism risk is low.\n\nI'm feeling pretty confident about this assessment because there are multiple positive indicators that suggest she's in a supportive environment with responsible behavior patterns. So my confidence level would be around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old female, younger individuals may still be maturing but females have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Identifies as White; race is a proxy for other factors but not the strongest on its own.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and conviction, which can influence future behavior or opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Height\", \"low\", \"5 feet 3 inches; no unusual physical characteristics linked to risk.\"),\n     (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"155 lbs; within a normal range for her age and height.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse, providing support and accountability.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college, limiting opportunities but showing some responsibility.\"),\n     (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana recently; potential issues with impulsivity or coping mechanisms.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month; protective factor against risky behavior.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment growing up in a rural area with biological mother.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considers God important, providing support and reducing risky behaviors.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
