    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old female over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Generally, younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. However, she's on the older side of young adults, which slightly lowers that risk. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but in terms of predicting recidivism, it's not as strong a factor as others. Plus, there are other factors here that might be more influential. I'll mark this as medium risk, though leaning towards low.\n\nArrests without convictions: She's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes lead to future legal issues, but the absence of convictions suggests she either wasn't found guilty or charges were dropped. This could indicate a lower likelihood of recidivism compared to someone with convictions. So this is low risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'6\" and 190 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a significant factor in predicting recidivism unless it relates to specific types of crimes, which we don't have info on here. Therefore, this is low risk.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Marital status can be protective against recidivism because being married often provides support and stability. Not living alone might mean she has a social network, but since she's single, that could also mean less supervision or structure. This is medium risk because it's more about the lack of marital ties rather than living situation.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level can be protective; having a high school diploma is better than none, but not pursuing higher education might limit future opportunities. This could influence her job prospects and overall stability. So this is medium risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment history shows some consistency, which is good for reducing recidivism. However, only holding one job in a year isn't as strong as having stable, long-term employment. So I'll consider this medium risk because it's positive but not robust enough yet.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and no depression in the past month. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism, so her abstinence lowers that risk significantly. Similarly, mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, and she doesn't show signs of depression right now. These are both strong protective factors. Each gets a low risk designation.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of six at a young age. Growing up with both parents is generally protective against delinquency because it often means more supervision and stability. However, living in a large household might have had its challenges, but the presence of both parents is a positive factor. This is low risk.\n\nFaith: She believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious involvement can be a protective factor as it often provides community support and a framework for behavior. This is low risk.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors are either low or medium. The lack of a college education, employment history, and not being married are the higher risks here, but they're still only medium. The protective factors like no drug use, mental health stability, family background, and faith are strong. So overall, her risk for rearrest in three years is relatively low. I'll predict \"NO\" with a high confidence level because the protective factors outweigh the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old; older young adults have slightly lower recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White; race can influence interactions but not as strong a predictor\"),\n     (\"arrests_no_convictions\", \"low\", \"2 arrests without convictions suggest lower likelihood of recidivism\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"5'6\\\", 190 lbs; no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, not living alone; lack of marital ties may increase risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college; limits future opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year; shows some consistency\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use past four years; lowers recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression past month; mental health contributes positively\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of six; protective factor\"),\n     (\"faith_involvement\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences her life; religious involvement is protective\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
