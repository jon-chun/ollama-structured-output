    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing and might not have stable life circumstances yet. So, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nShe's White. Race can sometimes be a factor in recidivism rates, but it's more about systemic issues than inherent risk. Since she hasn't been convicted before, her race alone isn't a strong indicator here. Low seems appropriate.\n\nOne arrest without a conviction is the next point. Arrests don't always lead to convictions, so this might not be as significant as multiple arrests or convictions. I'll assign low here too.\n\nHer height and weight are within normal ranges, which probably aren't directly linked to recidivism risk. So, low for that factor.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support, which might slightly increase risk. But since she's young, this isn't necessarily a red flag. Medium seems right.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is important; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities. This could contribute to medium risk because lower educational attainment is sometimes linked with higher recidivism rates.\n\nFour jobs in a year suggests some instability in employment. Job changes can be a sign of trouble maintaining consistent work, which might affect her ability to stay out of the criminal justice system. That's a medium factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior or involvement with illegal activities. This should be high.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so not feeling depressed is positive. Low here.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a household size of six. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, and larger households could mean less attention or supervision during upbringing. That's medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Positive religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk. So, low for this factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The high drug use is the most significant factor. Other mediums include age, living alone, education, urban upbringing, and household size. Low factors are race, arrest without conviction, physical stats, mental health, religion. \n\nConsidering these, her overall risk seems higher because of the substance abuse. So, I'd predict a YES for rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\":  [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and instability.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not significantly predict recidivism without systemic context.\"),\n     (\"arrest_record\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction indicates lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less supervision, but is context-dependent for young adults.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without higher education may limit opportunities contributing to medium risk.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability potentially affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant predictor of criminal involvement and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month indicates positive mental health contributing to lower risk.\"),\n     (\"upbringing_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with larger household may expose to higher crime areas affecting risk.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God provides support potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
