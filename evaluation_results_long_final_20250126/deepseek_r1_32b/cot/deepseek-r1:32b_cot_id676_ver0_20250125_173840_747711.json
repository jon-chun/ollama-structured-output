    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age. The person is 21, which is relatively young. I know that younger individuals are more likely to commit crimes because they might be dealing with impulsivity and haven't established stable lives yet. So, high risk here makes sense.\n\nNext, gender. He's male. Studies show that males are more prone to criminal behavior than females. That's a medium factor because while it does increase the risk, it's not as significant as other factors like age or prior convictions.\n\nRace is listed as White. I'm not sure if race is a strong predictor here. It might be more about socioeconomic factors tied to race rather than race itself. So, low risk for this category.\n\nHe's been arrested 22 times and convicted. That's a lot of arrests. High frequency indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. Definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'10\" and 160 lbs. I don't see how these physical attributes would directly relate to recidivism. So, low risk here.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Unmarried individuals might have less social support, which could contribute to higher recidivism rates. Medium risk because it's not the strongest factor but still relevant.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education level is a big one. Lower education often correlates with higher crime rates because of limited opportunities. High risk here as well.\n\nOnly held 1 job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress and fewer legitimate opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity. Medium risk, but it's significant.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because drugs can impair judgment and create dependencies that lead to more crimes. High risk factor.\n\nMental health issues: He felt very down for most of the past month. Depression or other mental health problems can increase criminal behavior, especially if untreated. Medium risk here.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of two. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and less supervision. However, living with both parents is protective, so this might balance out. Low risk because the positive factor (living with mother) might mitigate some negatives.\n\nNo religious affiliation: Belief in God can provide a moral framework and support system that deters criminal behavior. Lack of this could increase risk. Medium risk as it's another contributing factor without strong evidence.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors point towards a high likelihood of rearrest. The person has multiple strikes against him with prior convictions, substance abuse, mental health issues, and limited education. So the prediction is YES, with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which falls within a higher-risk demographic for recidivism due to factors like impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males are statistically more likely to be rearrested than females, though this factor alone does not dictate outcomes.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is considered a less significant predictor compared to other factors like criminal history and socioeconomic status.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"22 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, significantly increasing the risk of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not correlate strongly with recidivism rates, making this factor low impact.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married can reduce social support, which is linked to higher recidivism rates, though it's not the strongest indicator.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED correlates with limited opportunities and higher crime rates, making this a critical factor.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to criminal behavior through financial stress.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong predictor of recidivism due to impaired judgment and dependency issues.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression indicate potential mental health challenges, which can increase the likelihood of criminal activity without proper support.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an urban area with both parents present is a protective factor despite living in a higher-crime environment.\"),\n     (\"religious_affiliation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God may reduce access to a moral framework and community support, contributing to recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
