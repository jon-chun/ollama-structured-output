    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young people are generally at higher risk because they might still be establishing themselves in life and could be more involved in risky behaviors. So I think that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's male. Studies have shown that men are more likely to commit crimes than women, so gender as male would be a high risk factor.\n\nHis race is White. There isn't strong evidence that race alone predicts recidivism, but sometimes systemic factors can influence outcomes. I'll rate this as low since it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a prior conviction is a significant predictor of future offending, so that should be high risk.\n\nHeight 5'10\" and weight 190 lbs don't seem directly related to recidivism. So I'll mark those as low.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living arrangements can impact behavior; being alone might lead to less supervision or support. That sounds like a medium risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is important. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities, so I'll rate this as low risk since he has some education.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of crime due to financial strain. That's a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism. So that should be high.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute, but since he isn't currently depressed, maybe that's low risk. Though I should consider if undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues could play a role, but based on given info, it's low.\n\nRaised by both parents in a household of five. Growing up with both biological parents might offer more stability. So family environment is probably low risk.\n\nDoesn't believe God influences his life. Religious involvement can sometimes reduce recidivism, so lack thereof could be a medium risk factor as it might indicate less community support or different values.\n\nPutting all together: High factors include prior conviction, unemployment, and drug use. Medium are age, living alone, religious beliefs. Low includes gender (though I'm not sure about that), race, education, etc.\n\nI think the prediction leans towards a higher risk of rearrest because of multiple high-risk factors like prior offense, substance abuse, and unemployment. The confidence is quite high based on these strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Individual is 20 years old; young age can be associated with higher risk of recidivism as individuals may still be establishing themselves socially and professionally.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is a known predictor for higher rates of criminal behavior compared to female gender.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not predict recidivism but systemic factors could influence outcomes; however, no direct correlation with White race identified here.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Prior arrest and conviction history significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest due to established pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less supervision or support, potentially increasing risk of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some level of education; lack of higher education might limit opportunities but doesn't directly predict recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No employment history can lead to financial strain and increased likelihood of criminal behavior as a means of income.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is strongly linked to higher risk of recidivism due to substance abuse impacting decision-making and legal involvement.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No depression reported in the past month; however, mental health issues not currently present might still pose a risk if undiagnosed or untreated.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Raised by both biological parents may provide more stability which can reduce recidivism risk compared to individuals from disrupted families.\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has no influence on personal life may indicate less community support or different value systems, potentially increasing risk of criminal behavior.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
