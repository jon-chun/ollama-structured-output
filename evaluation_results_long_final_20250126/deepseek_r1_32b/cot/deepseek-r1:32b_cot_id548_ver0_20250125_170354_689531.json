    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old female within the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is relatively young. Young individuals, especially in their late teens, are often still developing and may be more prone to impulsive behavior. However, they also have a higher potential for rehabilitation compared to older adults. So, I think this is a low risk factor because while she's young, she hasn't shown a pattern of criminal behavior yet.\n\nNext, her gender is female. Statistically, females tend to have lower rearrest rates than males. This could be due to various social and biological factors, but the trend suggests that being female is associated with a lower risk of recidivism. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but it's not a direct indicator of rearrest likelihood. Without more context on systemic biases or discrimination affecting her specifically, I don't see race as a significant factor here. So, another low risk factor.\n\nHer arrest history is just one time without a conviction. A single arrest doesn't necessarily predict future behavior, especially since there was no conviction. This suggests that she might not have a strong pattern of criminal activity. Therefore, this is a medium risk factor because while it's a sign of some involvement with the law, it's not conclusive.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted, which is a positive point. The absence of convictions means there's less evidence of past criminal behavior leading to legal consequences. This lowers the likelihood of future rearrests, so I'll categorize this as low.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 130 lbs. Physical attributes like these don't typically correlate with recidivism rates. Unless there's a specific reason why size would be relevant (which isn't indicated here), this is just neutral information. So, another low risk factor.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate independence, which might be positive. However, it could also mean she lacks social support, which might increase vulnerability to negative influences or stressors that could lead to criminal behavior. This is a bit of a mixed bag, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a strong protective factor. Education can provide structure, opportunities, and reduce the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities by offering alternatives. This suggests she has positive engagement in her life, making rearrest less likely. So, low risk here.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment history shows some stability and responsibility. Having multiple jobs could indicate adaptability or financial necessity, but it doesn't directly point to higher risk. It might even suggest she's managing her time well between work and school. This is a positive sign, so low risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for rearrest because drug involvement can lead to criminal activities either through addiction or as a means to obtain drugs. However, since she's currently enrolled in school and holding jobs, there might be some protective factors mitigating this risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has felt down in the dumps at times in the past month, indicating possible depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can sometimes lead individuals into situations that increase their risk of arrest, especially if they're not being addressed properly. This is a concern but doesn't directly predict rearrest without more context. So, another medium factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological dad in an urban area. Family structure and upbringing can influence behavior. However, since she's doing well in school and has a job, it suggests that her upbringing hasn't necessarily led to negative outcomes. The urban environment could expose her to higher crime rates, but again, without more info, this is neutral. So, low risk.\n\nShe considers God important, which might provide a strong support system or sense of purpose. Spiritual beliefs can serve as protective factors against criminal behavior by offering moral guidance and community support. This is a positive sign, so low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are low, with a few medium ones related to drug use and mental health. The protective factors like education, employment, and spiritual beliefs likely outweigh the risks. Therefore, I predict a lower likelihood of rearrest within three years, with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 18 is relatively young, which may indicate higher potential for rehabilitation but also possible impulsiveness.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is associated with lower rearrest rates compared to males.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being White does not significantly predict rearrest likelihood without additional context on systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction indicates some legal involvement but lacks a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"conviction_history\", \"low\", \"No convictions suggest less established history of criminal behavior leading to legal consequences.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight (5'4\\\", 130 lbs) do not correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate lack of social support but also independence.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school provides positive engagement and structure, reducing risk of criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Held three jobs shows responsibility and stability, indicating positive life management.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use (marijuana, cocaine) is a significant factor but mitigated by current education and employment.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible mental health issues that could influence behavior if unaddressed.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Upbringing with biological dad in urban area lacks direct correlation without more context on environment impact.\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer support and purpose, acting as a protective factor against criminal behavior.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
