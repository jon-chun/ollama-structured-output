    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this criminal justice risk assessment step by step. I'm looking at a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant factor. Her age is another consideration\u2014being younger might mean she has less life experience but could also indicate potential for growth.\n\nShe\u2019s 5'4\" and weighs 110 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise any red flags in terms of physical risk factors. Never married and not living alone suggests she might have a support system or live with family, which is generally positive. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college, showing some level of education and ambition to improve her situation.\n\nHaving held one job during the year indicates some stability but perhaps limited work experience. Her past drug use (marijuana) within the last four years could be a concern, though it's not as severe as harder substances. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is good for mental health. Growing up with both biological parents in a rural area might indicate a stable upbringing.\n\nHer religious beliefs\u2014believing God has nothing to do with her life\u2014could suggest she doesn\u2019t rely on faith-based support systems, but that's not inherently negative.\n\nPutting this all together: the conviction and arrest are strong indicators of recidivism risk. Her age is a medium factor because it's young, but she's taking steps towards education which is positive. Drug use adds to the risk, while her mental health status is good. Lack of religious involvement isn't a significant factor here.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk with some confidence that rearrest could happen, but there are mitigating factors like education and current mental state.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 20 years old, which is in the higher range of young adulthood.
