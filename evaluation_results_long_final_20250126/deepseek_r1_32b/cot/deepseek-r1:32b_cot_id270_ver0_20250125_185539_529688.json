    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. I know that younger males are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they're more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, age would be a high-risk factor here.\n\nHe's White. Race can sometimes influence risk levels due to systemic factors, but it's not the strongest predictor on its own. Maybe medium?\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That shows some history of offending, which is a significant indicator for future recidivism. High risk here.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 180 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a major factor in recidivism unless it relates to specific offenses, so probably low risk.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living arrangements can be a factor; being alone might reduce supervision but doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk on its own. Maybe medium.\n\nEnrolled in school right now. Education is generally protective against recidivism because it provides structure and opportunities. So, this should be a low or no risk factor.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity as people might resort to illegal means for income. High risk here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to recidivism if untreated, but since he doesn't report feeling depressed, this might not add significant risk. Low or medium.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Family structure during upbringing is protective; living with both parents usually reduces risk. So low risk here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism, so this should be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors: prior arrests/convictions, unemployment, drug use. He also has some medium and low factors, including race, living alone, family background, religious beliefs, and education.\n\nThe presence of multiple high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'd predict YES with a confidence level considering the balance between strong predictors and protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age 18 is typically associated with higher risk due to developmental stage.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Race can influence systemic factors but isn't the strongest predictor alone.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a history of offending, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"physical_size\", \"low\", \"Height and weight aren't significant predictors unless related to specific offenses.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can reduce supervision but doesn't inherently indicate high risk.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school provides protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases likelihood of engaging in criminal activity for income.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana and cocaine use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces risk, though untreated mental health issues could contribute.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area provides protective factors.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer support against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
