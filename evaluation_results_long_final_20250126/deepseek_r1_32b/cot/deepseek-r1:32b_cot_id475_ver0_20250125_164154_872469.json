    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old woman over a three-year period. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Typically, younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but since she's already in her early twenties and hasn't been convicted yet, maybe the risk isn't as high. I'll consider this a low risk factor because being older within that young adult range might indicate some maturity.\n\nNext, gender is female. There's research suggesting that women tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to men, especially for violent crimes. So, her gender probably contributes to a lower risk here.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, but without more specific information about her socioeconomic status or other factors, it's hard to say how this affects her risk directly. Maybe there's some influence, but not significant enough for me to rate it higher than low.\n\nArrest history: she has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This is a bit tricky. Arrests can sometimes lead to charges, and even without convictions, multiple arrests might indicate a pattern of behavior that could be risky. However, since there are no convictions, maybe the risk isn't as high as it could be. I'm leaning towards medium here because while she hasn't been convicted, being arrested twice shows some contact with the criminal justice system.\n\nMarital status is married, and she's living with her spouse. Being in a stable relationship can often be protective against recidivism because of support systems and responsibilities that come with marriage. So this should be a low risk factor contributing to lower rearrest chances.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'2\" and 180 lbs. Physically, she's not someone who might be involved in violent crimes due to size, so this is probably a low risk factor as well.\n\nEmployment history: she's held four jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can sometimes indicate instability or issues with maintaining employment, which might correlate with higher recidivism rates. So I think this should be a medium risk factor because it shows some inconsistency that could be concerning.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is definitely a risk factor for rearrest, especially if it's ongoing. However, since she doesn't mention current use or other substances, maybe the risk isn't as high as someone using harder drugs regularly. I'll rate this medium because while it's not ideal, it might not be the strongest indicator here.\n\nNo depression in the past month: mental health issues can often lead to higher recidivism rates. Since she doesn't report feeling depressed recently, that's a positive sign. So this is a low risk factor contributing to lower chances of rearrest.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, household size 3. Having a stable family environment, especially with both parents present, can be protective against criminal behavior. This should be a low risk factor as it suggests a supportive upbringing.\n\nReligious beliefs: she believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious involvement is often associated with lower crime rates because of the social support and moral framework it provides. So this is another low risk factor contributing positively.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are low risk except for arrest history, employment instability, and past drug use which are medium. The protective factors seem to outweigh the risks here. Therefore, I would predict a lower chance of rearrest with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"20-year-old, older within young adult range, potential maturity\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"female, typically lower rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White, no significant influence without more context\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"two arrests, no convictions, possible behavior pattern\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"married, stable relationship protective\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physically not prone to violent crimes\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"four jobs in a year, potential instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use in past four years\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no depression reported recently\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing with both parents\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"positive association with lower crime rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
