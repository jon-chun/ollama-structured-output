    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to work through this risk assessment step by step. The person in question is a 21-year-old Hispanic female with some specific background details. My goal is to evaluate each risk factor, assign it a weight (low, medium, high), and then make a prediction about whether she'll be rearrested within three years.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided factors:\n\n1. Age: 21\n2. Gender: Female\n3. Ethnicity: Hispanic\n4. Number of Arrests: 5 times, convicted\n5. Height/Weight: 5'2\", 218 lbs (BMI is high, indicating obesity)\n6. Marital Status: Married but living alone\n7. Education: High school diploma, not in college\n8. Employment: Held two jobs in the past year\n9. Drug Use: None in past four years\n10. Depression: Not felt over the past month\n11. Early Living Situation: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area\n12. Religious Belief: Doesn't believe God affects her personally\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and think about how it might relate to rearrest risk.\n\n1. **Age (21)**:\n   - Young adults are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing emotionally and socially. However, 21 is slightly older than the typical peak age for criminal behavior, which is usually in the late teens or early twenties. So, this might be a moderate risk factor.\n\n2. **Gender (Female)**:\n   - Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males. This is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\n3. **Ethnicity (Hispanic)**:\n   - Hispanic individuals may face systemic issues and higher arrest rates due to various factors like socioeconomic status or policing practices. However, ethnicity alone isn't the strongest predictor; it's more about the context. So medium risk.\n\n4. **Number of Arrests (5 times, convicted)**:\n   - Multiple arrests and a conviction history are strong indicators of recidivism. The more prior convictions, the higher the risk. High risk here.\n\n5. **Height/Weight (High BMI)**:\n   - Obesity can lead to health issues which might indirectly affect behavior or opportunities, but it's not a direct risk factor for rearrest. Low risk unless there are other health complications mentioned, which there aren't.\n\n6. **Marital Status (Married but living alone)**:\n   - Being married is generally protective against recidivism because of social support. However, living alone might reduce that protective effect if she doesn't have spousal support nearby. So medium risk.\n\n7. **Education (High school diploma, not in college)**:\n   - Higher education often reduces recidivism rates. She has a high school diploma but isn't pursuing higher education. This is lower than ideal but not the highest risk factor. Medium risk.\n\n8. **Employment (Held two jobs last year)**:\n   - Stable employment can be protective as it provides income and structure. Holding two jobs suggests some stability, which is positive. Low risk.\n\n9. **Drug Use (None in past four years)**:\n   - Abstinence from drugs for several years is a strong protective factor against substance-related crimes. Low risk.\n\n10. **Depression (Not felt over the past month)**:\n    - Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but she hasn't reported depression recently. This is a positive sign, low risk.\n\n11. **Early Living Situation**:\n    - Growing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of four isn't inherently high risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family structure seems stable. Low to medium risk. I'll go with low since there's no indication of dysfunction in the household.\n\n12. **Religious Belief**:\n    - Lack of belief that God affects her personally doesn't directly correlate with recidivism. Some studies suggest religious involvement can be protective, but absence isn't necessarily a risk factor. Low risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I have several high and medium risks:\n\n- Number of Arrests: High\n- Ethnicity: Medium\n- Marital Status: Medium\n- Education: Medium\n\nThe protective factors are her gender, no drug use, stable employment, absence of depression, early living situation, and religious belief (though the latter isn't a strong factor either way).\n\nHer high number of arrests and conviction history is the strongest indicator. The medium factors include ethnicity, which might expose her to systemic issues; marital status, where she's married but alone, possibly reducing support; education level, not pursuing higher studies; and being Hispanic in an urban area.\n\nHowever, the protective factors are significant: no drug use, employment stability, mental health, etc. So while there are some red flags, the protective factors might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n\nI think she has a moderate chance of rearrest. On a confidence scale, considering her history but also her current stable aspects, I'd estimate around 65% confidence in predicting a 'YES' for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing emotional and social development.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (Hispanic)\", \"medium\", \"May face systemic issues contributing to higher arrest rates despite not being the strongest predictor alone.\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests (5 times, convicted)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate potential for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight (218 lbs)\", \"low\", \"High BMI may lead to health issues but isn't a direct risk factor without additional context.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Marriage is protective, but living alone might reduce its effectiveness.\"),\n     (\"Education (High school diploma)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of higher education may limit opportunities and contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Employment (Held two jobs)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment provides structure and income, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (None in past four years)\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs is a strong protective factor against substance-related crimes.\"),\n     (\"Depression (Not felt recently)\", \"low\", \"Absence of depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n     (\"Early Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an urban area with stable family structure doesn't indicate high risk.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief isn't directly linked to recidivism and doesn't act as a significant factor.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
