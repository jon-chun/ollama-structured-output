    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on what's provided.\n\nFirst, age is 18 years old. That's relatively young. Studies show that younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior because they might still be developing impulse control and decision-making skills. So I think this would be a high risk factor.\n\nNext, gender as male. Statistically, males are overrepresented in the criminal justice system compared to females. This doesn't mean all males are at higher risk, but it's a notable factor that contributes to recidivism rates. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nRace is White. There isn't as much variability among races for recidivism compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or education. So race itself might not be a significant predictor here. Low weight.\n\nArrest history: two arrests and one conviction. Having prior convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to future offenses, especially if the individual doesn't have strong support systems in place. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nConviction status is yes, which ties into the arrest history. It shows that there was a successful prosecution, indicating some level of involvement in criminal activity. Medium again.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 140 lbs. These are average for his age and gender, so they don't contribute much to risk assessment. Low factor.\n\nNever married. Marital status can sometimes be protective against recidivism because it often brings stability. Being unmarried might mean less social support, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own. I'll rate this as low.\n\nCurrently living alone. Living arrangements can impact recidivism. Without roommates or family, the individual might lack supervision and support. This could be a medium factor since it might lead to isolation or risky behaviors without accountability.\n\nEnrolled in school now. Educational attainment is generally protective against recidivism because it provides structure and opportunities for positive growth. Being enrolled suggests some level of engagement, which should lower the risk. Low factor here.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Without stable work, individuals might be more inclined to engage in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. This is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism because it can impair judgment, lead to addiction, and increase involvement in illegal activities to sustain drug use. High weight on this factor.\n\nNot depressed over the past month. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, that's less of a concern. Low factor.\n\nRaised by both biological parents in an urban area. Family structure is important; living with both parents usually provides more stability and supervision, which are protective factors. However, the urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or influences, but family support likely mitigates some of that risk. I think this is a low factor.\n\nBelieves God has influence in his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and deter from criminal activities. This is generally a protective factor, so low weight here.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: age (high), gender (medium), arrest history (medium), conviction (medium), living alone (medium), no job (high), drug use (high). The high factors are age, no job, and drug use, which are significant. Protective factors include being enrolled in school and having a supportive family background.\n\nThe individual is young, unemployed, has a substance abuse history, and lives alone without immediate support. These combine to suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, he's currently in school, which could be a mitigating factor if he remains engaged. But the lack of employment and ongoing drug issues are strong predictors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates due to developmental factors.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher rates but it's not the sole determinant of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race has less variability in predicting recidivism compared to other factors.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction suggest a pattern that could indicate future behavior.\"),\n     (\"conviction_status\", \"medium\", \"A conviction indicates involvement in criminal activity but doesn't solely predict recidivism.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married may lack social support but isn't a definitive indicator alone.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could lead to isolation and less supervision, increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"education_enrollment\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school suggests engagement and structure which lowers risk.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No job indicates lack of stable income and opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior due to potential addiction and impaired judgment.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed reduces the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Raised by both parents provides stability, mitigating urban environment risks.\"),\n     (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer purpose and deterrence from criminal activity.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
