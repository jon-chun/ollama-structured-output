    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over a three-year period. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19 years old. Typically, younger individuals are at higher risk because they're still developing socially and emotionally. But since he's enrolled in school, that might mitigate some risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNext, gender: male. Studies show males have higher recidivism rates. So this factor is high.\n\nRace/ethnicity: White. In some contexts, minorities might face more scrutiny, but race alone isn't a strong predictor here. Low risk factor.\n\nArrest history: one arrest with conviction. Only one past offense suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests. Medium.\n\nConviction status: yes. Having a conviction is a stronger indicator than just an arrest. So high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\", 225-249 lbs. Physical size doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, so low.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Unmarried individuals might have less social support, which can increase risk. Medium.\n\nEmployment: three jobs in a year. Frequent job changes could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. While substance use can be a concern, marijuana isn't as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs. Low.\n\nDepression: no depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, so absence here is low.\n\nFamily structure: lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable upbringing usually lowers risk. Low.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has a role in personal events. Studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism. Medium positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors leaning towards higher risk are gender (high), arrest history (medium), and conviction (high). The protective factors include education, stable family background, and religious beliefs. Weighing these, there's a moderate likelihood of rearrest but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is a young age associated with higher risk due to ongoing development, but mitigated by enrollment in school.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n     (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Race alone isn't a strong predictor here, though context can vary.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest with conviction suggests lower risk than multiple arrests.\"),\n     (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction is a stronger indicator than just an arrest, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is less strongly linked to recidivism than harder drugs.\"),\n     (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month reduces associated risks.\"),\n     (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's role may reduce recidivism through positive social engagement.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
