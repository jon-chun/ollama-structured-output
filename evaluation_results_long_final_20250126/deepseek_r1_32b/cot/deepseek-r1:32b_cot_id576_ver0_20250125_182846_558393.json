    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 21-year-old female within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. I remember that younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing socially and economically. So, I'll mark this as high.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can be a sensitive factor, but some studies show that minorities might have higher rearrest rates due to systemic issues, so being White could be a lower risk here. Low weight.\n\nOne arrest with a conviction. Having a prior conviction is definitely a significant factor. It shows she's been through the criminal justice system before, which can increase the likelihood of future arrests. High weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'2\" and 185 lbs. Body size isn't typically a major factor in recidivism. So, low.\n\nMarried and living with spouse. Stable relationships are protective factors. They often reduce recidivism because they provide support and accountability. Low risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is crucial. Lower education can limit job opportunities, increasing the chances of involvement in crime. High weight.\n\nFour jobs in a year. Job instability might indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which could lead to criminal behavior as an alternative means of income. Medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity to support habits. High weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but she's not currently depressed. So, low risk here.\n\nLived with non-biological parents as a child. This could indicate instability during formative years, which might contribute to higher risk. Medium.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. Religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism because they provide moral guidelines and community support. Low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several high-risk factors like prior conviction, drug use, low education; some medium like job instability and childhood environment; and a few low ones like age, race, marriage. The prediction leans towards higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age 21\", \"high\", \"Young individuals are at higher risk for recidivism as they develop socially and economically.\"),\n     (\"Race - White\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have lower rearrest rates compared to minorities due to systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"One arrest with conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions increase likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n     (\"Height 5'2\\\" Weight 185 lbs\", \"low\", \"Body size isn't a major factor in recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n     (\"Married and living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Stable relationships are protective factors reducing recidivism.\"),\n     (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lower education limits job opportunities, increasing crime involvement risk.\"),\n     (\"Four jobs in a year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability may indicate difficulty maintaining employment, potentially leading to criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"Drug use - marijuana and cocaine past four years\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, impairing judgment and leading to crime for support.\"),\n     (\"No depression past month\", \"low\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism; absence here reduces risk.\"),\n     (\"Lived with non-biological parents as child\", \"medium\", \"Childhood instability might contribute to higher risk factors in adulthood.\"),\n     (\"Believes God influences her life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism, providing moral guidelines and community support.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
