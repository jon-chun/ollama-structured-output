    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male Hispanic. Age-wise, being in early adulthood might not be as high risk as someone younger, but combined with other factors, it could matter. Hispanic identity alone isn't a risk factor, but sometimes community dynamics can play a role.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. That's significant because multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues or involvement in activities that lead to police encounters. Even without convictions, the pattern of arrest suggests some level of risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'11\" and 165 lbs\u2014nothing unusual there. No immediate health risks indicated by this.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if there's no support system or supervision, especially for someone without stable employment or education.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of formal education can limit opportunities, potentially leading to involvement in criminal activities due to limited legitimate options.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor because it can lead to idleness and possibly seeking other means of income, which might be illegal.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use isn't as risky as harder drugs, but it's still an indication of substance involvement, which can sometimes correlate with other criminal behaviors.\n\nNo depression over the past month. Mental health issues like depression are risk factors, so not having them could slightly lower the risk, but this might vary depending on other circumstances.\n\nLived in a large household (size 10) in a rural area with both biological parents at a young age. Growing up in a larger family might provide some support, but sometimes it can also mean less individual attention. Rural areas might have different crime dynamics compared to urban ones.\n\nConsiders that God has nothing to do with his personal events. This could indicate a lack of religious involvement or community ties, which might be protective factors against criminal behavior. Without these ties, there's potentially less social control.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, no convictions but still concerning; unemployment; no formal education; substance use; living alone without support; and potential lack of community ties. These factors seem to lean towards a higher risk, especially considering the pattern of arrests and lack of positive influences or opportunities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
