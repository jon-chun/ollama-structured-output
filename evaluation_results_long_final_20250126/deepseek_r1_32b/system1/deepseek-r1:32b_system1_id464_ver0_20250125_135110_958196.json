    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk assessment for an 18-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. That's a bit young, but he's just entering adulthood. His gender is male; statistically, males do have higher crime rates than females, so that could be a slight risk indicator.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't see any immediate risk factors tied to race here, unless there are other systemic issues, which aren't mentioned.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to note. An arrest without conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's high-risk. It could be a minor offense or an unfounded charge.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 160 lbs. That seems average; no red flags there in terms of physicality contributing to risk.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate limited social support, which might be a factor, but at his age, it's not uncommon, especially if he's focusing on school or other pursuits.\n\nHe's enrolled in school right now. Education is generally a protective factor against crime because it provides structure and opportunities. So this is positive.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment, even part-time, can be another protective factor as it gives him something to focus on and a steady income.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression symptoms in the last month. Both of these are strong protective factors. Substance abuse and mental health issues are often linked with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. Growing up in a stable, two-parent home is another protective factor. Family stability can contribute to lower delinquency rates.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. Religious affiliation or lack thereof isn't directly tied to risk unless it's part of broader behavioral patterns, which don't seem to be the case here.\n\nPutting this all together: he has a couple of minor risk factors like being male and having an arrest without conviction. However, he has several protective factors such as education, employment, no substance use, stable upbringing, and mental health. The protective factors seem to outweigh the risks. \n\nTherefore, my prediction is that he's not a high-risk individual. My confidence in this assessment is quite high because the positives are strong and numerous.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
