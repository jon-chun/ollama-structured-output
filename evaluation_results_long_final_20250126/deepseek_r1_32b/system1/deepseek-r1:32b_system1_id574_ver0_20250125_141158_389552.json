    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm analyzing this person's risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills and are more prone to risky behaviors. However, being female generally correlates with lower crime rates compared to males.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, so this could indicate some involvement in illegal activities, but without a conviction, it's less clear. It might still raise some concerns about potential risk factors.\n\nHer physical attributes\u20145'5\" and 135 lbs\u2014are average and don't particularly indicate any risk on their own. \n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risks if the person lacks a support network, but it's not a definitive indicator. Being single isn't inherently risky.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Higher education typically correlates with lower crime rates because it often provides more opportunities and stability. However, being enrolled doesn't mean she's actively engaged or succeeding academically, so there might be some uncertainty here.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can sometimes lead to higher risks if someone is struggling financially and may resort to illegal activities out of necessity or boredom. But it could also just mean she's focusing on her studies or has other plans.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse, especially harder drugs like cocaine, can be a significant risk factor. It might indicate involvement in illegal activities, potential for addiction, and associated behaviors that could lead to criminal acts. The fact that she's used these substances is concerning.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to risky behavior, but since she isn't currently depressed, this might slightly lower her risk compared to someone who is struggling mentally.\n\nHer background includes living with her biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent home and urban environment could present certain challenges, like higher crime rates or limited resources, which might influence behavior. However, it's not a direct indicator of risk.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. This religious affiliation might provide some moral guidance and support, potentially reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. It can be a protective factor against criminal activity.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is minor without conviction. Education is positive but she's unemployed, which could be a concern. Drug use, especially cocaine, raises significant red flags. However, her lack of depression and religious beliefs might offer some protection. \n\nOverall, while there are several risk factors, the presence of substance abuse, unemployment, and past arrest might indicate higher risk despite protective factors like education and religion. The confidence isn't extremely high because some factors counterbalance each other.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
