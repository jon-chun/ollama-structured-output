    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male, white. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally. However, being white doesn't inherently indicate high risk; it's more about other behaviors or history.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, the severity might be lower than if he had a criminal record.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 204 lbs. Physically, that doesn't necessarily point to high risk unless it's related to other factors like substance abuse or aggression, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide some social support, but not being in a committed relationship could be a neutral factor depending on the context.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is a positive sign of completing high school equivalency, but not pursuing higher education might limit future opportunities, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if there's unemployment or underemployment.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. That could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Frequent job changes might suggest issues with responsibility or consistency, which can be red flags for some assessments.\n\nDrug use: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor. Cocaine use, especially, is concerning because it's more likely to lead to addiction and other negative outcomes compared to marijuana.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, so the absence here might be a positive sign, but substance abuse could still indicate other underlying issues.\n\nHe lived in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of six at a young age. Growing up in a large family in an urban setting can have both pros and cons\u2014more people around for support but also potential challenges like overcrowding or limited resources. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any impact on his life. This could relate to a lack of religious or spiritual guidance, which some studies suggest might correlate with higher risk behaviors if there's no other strong support system in place.\n\nPutting this all together: the most significant factors pointing towards high risk are the drug use (especially cocaine), frequent job changes indicating possible instability, and a history of arrest. The absence of depression is a positive, but the substance abuse and employment issues are major red flags. His age might mean he's still at an impressionable stage where interventions could help, but without more context on his behavior or environment, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI think there's a moderate confidence level here because while several factors suggest potential risk, some positive aspects like having a GED and living with others provide some counterbalance. However, the substance abuse is a strong indicator, so overall, I lean towards high risk with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
