    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence behavior. However, being Black alone isn't a risk factor; it's more about how other factors interact with this identity.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate past issues with the law, which is often linked to higher recidivism rates. So this definitely points towards a high-risk category.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'8\" and 165 lbs. I don't see how these physical attributes directly relate to risk unless there's something about build that's relevant, but nothing jumps out here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can be a factor\u2014living with others might offer some support or supervision, which could lower risk. However, not being in a committed relationship might also indicate less stability. It's a bit mixed, so I'm not sure how much this contributes to the overall risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment. Education is often correlated with employment opportunities and life stability. Without it, he might face more challenges finding stable jobs, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities as a means of income.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. That could be seen both ways: on one hand, holding multiple jobs shows some level of employability, but frequent job changes might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which could lead to financial stress and associated risks.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana. While marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, any drug use can be a marker for potential substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher criminal behavior rates. However, it's not as strong an indicator as harder substances or more frequent/current use.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health plays a role, and untreated depression can lead to risky behaviors. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might slightly lower the risk compared to someone with current mental health issues.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could influence exposure to criminal behavior. However, growing up with both parents or a stable family environment can be protective factors. It's somewhat neutral unless other factors are present.\n\nBelieves God has a role in personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and support system, which might reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, limited education, frequent job changes, past drug use\u2014all these factors contribute to a higher risk profile. The protective factors like living with others, no current depression, and religious beliefs are present but may not outweigh the negatives enough to bring the risk down significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
