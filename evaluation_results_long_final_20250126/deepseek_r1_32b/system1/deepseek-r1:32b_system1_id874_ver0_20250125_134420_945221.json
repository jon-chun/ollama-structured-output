    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills, but being White doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a significant point. A prior conviction suggests that he's had past issues with the law, which could increase his risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight is 240 lbs. Physical size isn't directly an indicator of risk unless it relates to specific types of crimes, but I don't have information on that here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Not being married might not be a strong factor, but living with others could influence behavior, though it's neutral without more context.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can be protective against crime; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHeld three jobs during the year. Job stability might indicate responsibility, which is generally positive for risk assessment.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors or substance-related crimes, depending on context.\n\nHasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important; no depression symptoms are a good sign and might lower risk compared to someone with mental health issues.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 at a young age. Stable family environment early on can be protective, so this is a positive factor.\n\nConsiders God has nothing to do with personal events. This relates to personal beliefs but isn't directly an indicator of risk unless it's tied to other factors like lack of community support or religious involvement which could have protective effects.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior conviction is the most concerning point. His education and family background are positive, as is his current mental health state. However, past convictions can carry significant weight in risk assessments. Additionally, substance use might indicate some level of risk, but without more context on how that use affects his behavior or legal history, it's hard to assess fully.\n\nConsidering all factors, the prior conviction and drug use might suggest higher risk, but his educational background and stable upbringing counterbalance that somewhat. The confidence isn't extremely high because while there are red flags, there are also mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the individual's risk factors indicates a moderate concern due to past convictions and substance use, offset by positive indicators like education and family stability.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
