    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. The person is a 21-year-old female who's white. She's been arrested nine times and convicted. That sounds like she has a significant criminal history. Nine arrests are quite a few, especially at her age.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 105 lbs. I don't know if that's relevant to risk assessment, but maybe it could indicate something about her physicality or health, which might not be directly related here.\n\nShe hasn't been married and isn't living alone currently. That could mean she has a support system, which is generally positive, but sometimes living with others can complicate things, like influence from peers or lack of personal accountability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can be a factor\u2014higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled in higher education might indicate limited future opportunities, which could lead to higher risk if she's not engaged in education or stable employment.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment stability is important. Having only one job might suggest some instability or difficulty maintaining consistent work, which can be a risk factor as unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana\u2014in the past four years. Substance abuse, even if it's marijuana, can be a significant indicator of potential future issues, especially if it's ongoing or indicates other underlying problems. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so that might not add to her mental health risk factors.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area in a household of five when she was young. Family background can be relevant\u2014growing up in a large family in an urban setting could have various implications depending on the environment and support systems available then.\n\nShe doesn't consider God as having any influence on her life. This might relate to her belief system or lack thereof, which could tie into other factors like motivation or community involvement. However, I'm not sure how significant this is in risk assessment compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. The drug use adds another layer. Her education level and employment status aren't great but might not be as severe as the criminal history and substance use. The lack of depression might slightly mitigate some mental health risks, but overall, the factors lean towards high risk.\n\nI'm thinking the prediction should be \"YES\" with a confidence around 85% because while she doesn't have all the highest risk indicators, the combination of her arrest record, drug use, and limited education/employment stability points to a higher likelihood of recidivism or future issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}",
