    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female identifying as Black. Age-wise, being younger can sometimes be a factor because they might still be developing decision-making skills. But gender and race don't inherently indicate risk; it's more about other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because arrests could suggest some involvement in activities that led to police attention, even if there were no convictions. However, lack of conviction might mean the charges weren't upheld, so it's not as strong an indicator as actual convictions.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'4\" and 105 lbs. Not sure how this plays into risk assessment directly, but maybe in terms of ability to commit certain crimes? Probably not a major factor on its own.\n\nNever married and living alone at 18. That's somewhat common for her age, especially if she's in school or starting her career. Living alone could mean more freedom but might also indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor depending on other circumstances.\n\nEnrolled in school currently is positive because education can correlate with lower recidivism rates. She has held one job during the year, which shows some responsibility and stability. Both of these are protective factors against high risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a strong positive sign. Drug use can often be linked to higher criminal behavior, so not using drugs reduces that risk.\n\nHowever, she mentioned feeling down in the dumps at times over the past month. This could indicate mental health issues, like depression or anxiety. Mental health struggles can sometimes lead to behaviors that increase risk if untreated, but it's just one factor among many.\n\nShe grew up in a large household of 10 in an urban area with her biological mother. Large families can sometimes be both protective and risky depending on the environment. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence exposure or involvement, but that's more about environmental factors than personal risk.\n\nShe considers God significant in her life, which is a positive factor often linked to better mental health and decision-making through faith-based support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some concerning points like arrests without convictions and recent feelings of depression. However, she also has strong protective factors such as being in school, employed, not using drugs, having a supportive religious belief, and no criminal history beyond arrests. The lack of drug use is a big plus because substance abuse is often tied to higher risk.\n\nThe mental health aspect is a bit of a wildcard. While feeling down could be a sign of potential issues, it's just a symptom without knowing the severity or if she's seeking help. Without more information, it's hard to weigh this factor heavily.\n\nSo overall, while there are some red flags, the protective factors seem stronger. Therefore, I don't think she presents a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
