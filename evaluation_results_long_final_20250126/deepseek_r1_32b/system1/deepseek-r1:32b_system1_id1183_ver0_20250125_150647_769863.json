    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might still be establishing themselves, which could influence risk. However, being Black in some contexts may relate to systemic issues, but I'm focusing on individual risk factors here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point. A conviction history usually indicates higher risk because it shows past involvement with the criminal justice system. It suggests that there have been legal consequences for his actions, which could be a marker for future behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, weight 178 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't typically indicate high risk unless they relate to specific crimes, but I don't see that here.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with lower supervision or support networks, which might be a risk factor depending on other circumstances. However, it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is mixed; having a GED is a positive sign, but not being in higher education could mean limited opportunities for stable employment, which might contribute to risk if job prospects are poor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a strong indicator of potential involvement in crime due to lack of income and structure. This seems like a significant red flag.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Substance use can increase risk, especially if it's frequent or impacts daily functioning. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so this might not be as impactful unless it's leading to other issues.\n\nNo depression over the past month. Mental health stability can sometimes lower risk, but the absence of depression doesn't necessarily mean low risk on its own.\n\nHe grew up in a household with adults who weren't biological, foster, or adoptive parents. This could suggest instability in his upbringing, which might contribute to behavioral issues later on.\n\nLives in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but this is more about environmental factors rather than individual risk.\n\nConsiders that God has something to do with personal events. Religious belief can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, providing a sense of purpose and structure.\n\nPutting it all together: The conviction history, unemployment, and possible instability from upbringing are significant factors. However, the lack of current mental health issues and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. So, while there are notable red flags, especially the conviction and unemployment, other factors suggest he's not necessarily high risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate confidence in predicting NO for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
