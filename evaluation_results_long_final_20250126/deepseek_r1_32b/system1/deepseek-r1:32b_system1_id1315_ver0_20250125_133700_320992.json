    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male identifying as Black. Age-wise, younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence behavior. Race can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments due to societal biases, but I have to focus on the facts here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant point. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of past illegal activity, which can hint at potential future risks. However, it depends on the nature of the crimes, which aren't specified here.\n\nHis height is 6 feet and weight is 187 lbs. Physical stature isn't typically a risk factor unless it's related to specific types of crimes, but without more context, I don't see this as a major indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and currently lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with less social support, which might contribute to higher risk if the individual lacks a stable network. However, it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Educational attainment can influence opportunities and life trajectory. A GED is a positive step, but not pursuing further education might limit his options, potentially leading to other issues.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment stability is important; holding a job suggests some level of responsibility and integration into society. However, only having one job in a year might indicate limited work experience or instability.\n\nNo drug use for four years and no recent depression. This is positive. Substance abuse and mental health issues are often linked to higher risk factors, so the absence here is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with his biological father in a rural area in a household of three. Family structure can influence development; growing up with both parents is generally seen as protective. However, living in a rural area might have different implications depending on the community's crime rates and support systems.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious or spiritual beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which are protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The two arrests and one conviction stand out as significant risk indicators. However, his recent clean record regarding drug use and mental health is positive. He's employed, which is a protective factor, but only having one job in a year might indicate some instability. Living alone could be a concern if there's a lack of support, but without more context on social connections, it's hard to judge.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are red flags with the criminal history, other aspects suggest he's making strides towards stability. Therefore, the risk isn't extremely high, but there's still some cause for concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
