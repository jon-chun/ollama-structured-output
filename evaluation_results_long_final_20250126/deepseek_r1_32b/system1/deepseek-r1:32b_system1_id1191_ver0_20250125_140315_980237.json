    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm evaluating whether the given risk factors indicate high risk for recidivism or criminal behavior.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age is a factor since younger individuals are more likely to be involved in crime. Being Black might relate to systemic issues and higher arrest rates, but it's not inherently a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrest history is significant because past behavior can predict future actions. Having a conviction means he's already faced legal consequences, which could indicate a pattern or increased likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 152 lbs) don't seem relevant to risk assessment, so I'll set those aside.\n\nNever married and living alone could be factors. Stable relationships can provide support, so being single might increase risk if there's less social supervision or emotional support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Educational attainment is mixed; while having a diploma is positive, not continuing education might limit future opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of involvement in crime for economic reasons.\n\nHeld one job in the past year suggests some stability, but it's just one job. Consistent employment can lower risk, so this is a moderate point.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a concern. Substance abuse can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior, especially if seeking drugs leads to other illegal activities.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive; mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risks, but their absence here is neutral or slightly positive.\n\nLived in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family structure could be protective if relationships were stable. However, living alone now may reduce that support.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life, which can provide moral guidance and support, potentially reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: past convictions, arrest history, drug use, and living situation suggest some elevated risk. However, factors like education, employment, no mental health issues, and religious beliefs counterbalance this somewhat. So, the prediction is YES for high risk, but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
