    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high-risk individual based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age can sometimes be a factor because younger individuals might have less stability or experience. However, race shouldn't inherently indicate risk; it's more about other circumstances.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction is concerning because it shows some interaction with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's less severe than if she had a criminal record.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs 146 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk, so this doesn't add much to the assessment.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone could mean independence or instability, depending on other factors. No marriage history isn't directly linked to high risk unless it's coupled with other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and lead to higher engagement in criminal activities. This is a red flag.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment is another key indicator. Without stable employment, individuals might turn to illegal activities for income or struggle with other issues like substance abuse.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use is a major risk factor. Cocaine use especially can lead to dependency and involvement in illegal activities to sustain the habit.\n\nFelt down in dumps most days past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health struggles can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and contribute to engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 8 in an urban area. Growing up in a large family might have its challenges, but it's not inherently negative unless there were issues like neglect or abuse mentioned here. It doesn't directly point to high risk without more context.\n\nConsiders God has something to do with personal events. This suggests some level of spirituality or belief system, which could be protective rather than a risk factor. People with strong beliefs might have better coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: no education, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues\u2014these are significant red flags that suggest high-risk behavior. The lack of a conviction and her current living situation don't mitigate these factors enough to consider her low risk. Therefore, the prediction is YES with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
