    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female identifying as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or lack of experience. But gender and race don't inherently indicate risk unless there are other contributing factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions, especially recent ones, are strong indicators of potential recidivism. However, since it's only one conviction, the severity and nature of that crime matter. Without knowing what she was convicted for, it's hard to gauge the risk accurately.\n\nHer physical attributes\u20145'8\" and 135 lbs\u2014don't typically relate directly to risk unless there are specific circumstances, which don't seem relevant here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living with others can sometimes provide support, reducing recidivism risk, but it also depends on the household dynamics. Being single doesn't necessarily mean high risk, but it might limit certain social supports.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education generally lowers risk because it often leads to better job opportunities and stability. So this is a positive factor against high risk.\n\nHeld three jobs in a year. Job stability can be good, but holding multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might correlate with higher risk if the person is struggling financially or socially.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be linked to other risky behaviors and legal issues. However, since she doesn't report depression, maybe her mental health isn't a significant factor here.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally protective against high risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about the environment than the individual unless there were negative influences.\n\nConsiders God has something to do with her life. Religious involvement can be a protective factor, often associated with lower recidivism rates because of community support and personal accountability.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a prior conviction which is a significant risk factor. However, she's pursuing higher education, which is protective. Her drug use could be a concern, but no current depression suggests she might not be struggling mentally at the moment. Living with family provides some stability, and her religious beliefs add another protective layer.\n\nThe confidence isn't very high because there are both positive and negative factors. The conviction is a key point, but the education and support systems might mitigate that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
