    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might be more prone to certain behaviors, but race shouldn't influence risk assessment unfairly.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could indicate potential issues, but it's not a conviction which carries more weight legally.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 0 inches and 160 lbs. These are average stats and probably don't contribute much to risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, but that can vary widely depending on individual circumstances.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education level is moderate; some studies show higher education correlates with lower recidivism, so this could be a slight risk factor.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment history is positive as steady employment can reduce criminal activity likelihood.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, especially if frequent or problematic, can increase risk by impairing judgment and leading to other illegal activities.\n\nFeeling down for some of the past month. Mental health issues like depression can be linked to higher engagement in risky behaviors, so this is a concern.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area as a child. Family stability from a young age might actually reduce risk factors, but living in an urban area could mean exposure to more crime opportunities.\n\nConsiders God influential. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The person has some risk factors like past marijuana use and recent depression symptoms. However, they also have protective factors such as living with both parents, having a job history, religious beliefs, etc. The arrest without conviction is a minor point. So overall, the risk doesn't seem extremely high.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided risk factors indicates that while there are some concerning elements like past drug use and recent depressive symptoms, they are balanced by protective factors such as stable family background, employment history, and religious beliefs. The confidence level reflects the moderate risk posed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
