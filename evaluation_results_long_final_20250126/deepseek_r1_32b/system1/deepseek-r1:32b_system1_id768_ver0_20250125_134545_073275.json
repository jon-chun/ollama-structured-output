    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic female who's been arrested four times and has convictions. That's a significant history of criminal behavior, which usually indicates higher risk.\n\nShe's currently employed in three jobs over the past year. While having multiple jobs might suggest she's trying to support herself, it could also mean instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which can sometimes correlate with higher stress and potential for further issues.\n\nHer weight is 180 lbs at 5'4\", but that's not a risk factor in itself unless there are health complications, which aren't mentioned here. So I won't focus on that.\n\nShe lives alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor if she has a stable environment, but it might also mean less supervision or support. Not being married doesn't necessarily indicate risk; it's more about other factors like social connections.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is somewhat neutral here\u2014having graduated is positive, not pursuing higher education might not be directly risky unless there are barriers to employment because of that.\n\nDrug use over the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use within the past month is concerning, especially since she's using harder drugs like cocaine. This indicates active substance abuse, which is a strong risk factor for recidivism and other legal issues.\n\nShe also reported feeling down in the dumps at times during the past month, with nothing cheering her up. That suggests possible depression or anxiety, mental health issues that can contribute to risky behaviors if untreated. Mental health struggles are significant factors in criminal justice risk assessments because they can impair judgment, reduce coping mechanisms, and increase vulnerability to substance abuse.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six, which might imply potential overcrowding or economic challenges but not necessarily high risk on its own. However, family environment can sometimes influence behavior, especially if there were issues like domestic conflict or lack of supervision.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal events. That could indicate a positive coping mechanism or strong religious beliefs, which are generally protective factors. However, without more context, it's hard to assess the impact of this on her risk level.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use including cocaine, feelings of depression, and somewhat unstable employment despite having three jobs. These factors point towards a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior or other negative outcomes. The mental health aspect adds another layer since untreated mental illness can exacerbate other issues.\n\nTherefore, the prediction would be \"YES\" indicating high risk, with a confidence level reflecting moderate certainty based on these factors. I'd say around 75% confidence because while there are several red flags, some variables like her education and religious beliefs might offer slight protection.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
