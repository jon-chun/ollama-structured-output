    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze the risk factors for this individual step by step. The person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which indicates some criminal history. Her physical characteristics include being 5'2\" and weighing 185 lbs, which might not be directly relevant to her risk assessment but could be noted for other considerations.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, which is a positive factor as stable relationships can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates. However, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, suggesting potential educational challenges that might limit her opportunities and increase the risk of engaging in criminal activities again.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year, which is quite frequent job changes. High job turnover can sometimes be associated with instability, which could be a red flag. Her substance use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, which is a significant concern as drug use can often lead to or exacerbate criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate that she's not currently experiencing mental health issues that could contribute to her risk. However, past drug use could still be a factor even if she's not currently feeling depressed.\n\nIn terms of background, she lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in an urban area when she was young. This could point to some instability in her early upbringing, which might have contributed to her current risk factors.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, indicating a belief system or spirituality that might offer support and guidance. This could be a protective factor against high-risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a criminal history, substance abuse issues, educational limitations, frequent job changes, but also has a stable marital relationship and a spiritual belief. The presence of both positive and negative factors makes the assessment complex. However, given her arrest record, drug use, and lack of education, these are strong indicators that might suggest a higher risk for recidivism or further criminal activity.\n\nI would lean towards predicting high risk due to the combination of past convictions, substance abuse, and limited educational attainment, even though there are some protective factors present. The confidence level is moderately high because while there are several concerning factors, her current mental health status and marital stability provide some counterbalance.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has a criminal history, substance abuse issues, and limited education, which are significant risk factors. However, she has a stable marriage and a spiritual belief, which are protective. The balance leans towards high risk.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
