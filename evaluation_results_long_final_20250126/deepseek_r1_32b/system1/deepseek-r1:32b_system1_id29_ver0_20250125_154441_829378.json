    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age-wise, younger individuals might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors, but being female might lower some risks compared to males. Her ethnicity probably isn't a significant factor here unless there's specific data showing otherwise, which I don't have.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. That could indicate some involvement in minor offenses or maybe false accusations. Without a conviction, the risk might be slightly lower than if she had multiple convictions.\n\nHer height is 5'1\" and weight between 200-224 lbs. Weight can sometimes correlate with health issues, which might affect behavior, but I'm not sure how directly that ties into criminal risk without more context.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean she doesn't have the support system of a partner or family, which might influence her decisions or stress levels. However, being single isn't inherently a risk factor unless combined with other issues.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school suggests she's engaged in education, which is usually a positive sign. Education can be protective against criminal behavior, so this might lower her risk.\n\nShe held three jobs in the past year. Job stability can sometimes be a concern if someone is job-hopping due to issues like substance use or behavioral problems. Three jobs might indicate some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a red flag.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as high-risk as harder drugs, but any drug use can sometimes lead to other risky behaviors or impair judgment. Also, she's used it recently within the past month, so there might be ongoing issues.\n\nShe feels down some of the time and nothing cheers her up. This could indicate depression or anxiety, which are mental health concerns. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if untreated, especially if they lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a household size of six. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than the individual. A larger household could mean less attention or more stress, which might contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nShe considers God important, suggesting she has some spiritual support or belief system. This can be protective as it often provides a moral framework and community support.\n\nPutting this all together: She has some concerning factors like drug use, recent feelings of depression, job instability, living alone, and an arrest history (even without conviction). However, she's enrolled in school, which is positive, identifies with a spiritual belief, and hasn't been convicted. The mental health aspect could be a significant factor if it's impacting her behavior or leading to other issues.\n\nI'm not sure if all these add up to high risk. The presence of drug use and mental health issues might push the risk higher, but without more serious convictions or a pattern of violent behavior, it might not reach a \"YES\" prediction. Maybe leaning towards medium risk, so confidence isn't too high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
