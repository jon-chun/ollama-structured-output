    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze these risk factors step by step. The person is a 21-year-old White male, which might not be significant on its own but could be part of broader patterns. He's been arrested three times and convicted, which are strong indicators of past delinquency. His age being young could mean he's still at a stage where risky behavior is more common.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs\u2014nothing unusual there. Living alone without being married might suggest limited social support, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk because there's less oversight or accountability. Not having a high school diploma or GED could limit his opportunities, potentially leading to more frustration or engagement in criminal activities if other supports aren't present.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year\u2014job instability is often linked to higher recidivism rates as it can indicate difficulty maintaining steady employment, which is a protective factor against crime. The fact that he hasn't used drugs in the past four years is positive because substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior. Similarly, not feeling depressed recently reduces the likelihood of mental health issues driving criminal activity.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of three\u2014family structure can play a role; living with both parents is generally protective, but here it's only his mother, which might indicate some instability or single-parent challenges. His religious belief that God influences his life could be a protective factor as spirituality often correlates with lower crime rates.\n\nPutting this all together: the conviction history and arrest record are significant red flags. The lack of education and unstable employment add to the risk factors. However, his current sobriety and mental health status mitigate some risks. The living situation alone might not be enough on its own but combined with other factors could increase risk. So, overall, while there are mitigating factors, the past convictions and instability in key areas make him a higher risk candidate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
