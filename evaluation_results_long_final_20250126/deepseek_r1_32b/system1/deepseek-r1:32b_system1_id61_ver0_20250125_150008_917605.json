    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess whether this individual poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. That's relatively young, and younger individuals might be more prone to certain behaviors, but it's not necessarily a high-risk factor on its own.\n\nHe identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. I don't see any immediate risk indicators tied specifically to this demographic, so that probably doesn't affect the risk level much.\n\nOne arrest without conviction suggests some involvement with the law but no proven offense yet. It could indicate a minor incident or perhaps a misunderstanding, so it's a moderate point.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 160 lbs. That seems physically fit but not particularly imposing in terms of size-related risk factors.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014living alone might sometimes be associated with less supervision, which could be a slight concern, but he's managing his life independently without immediate issues noted.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college shows educational engagement, which is generally positive. Being in college can provide structure and reduce idle time that might otherwise lead to risky behavior.\n\nNo jobs held during the year\u2014unemployment or underemployment can sometimes be linked with higher risk behaviors if someone has a lot of free time without productive outlets. This could be a point of concern.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While marijuana isn't as high-risk as harder substances, any drug use can indicate potential for other risky behaviors or substance-related issues.\n\nNo depression over the past month is positive; mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk if untreated, so this is a good sign.\n\nRaised by both biological parents in an urban area of four people. Stable upbringing with both parents present usually indicates lower risk factors since there's more supervision and support during formative years.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events\u2014this could indicate a strong moral compass or community involvement, which generally reduces risk as it suggests accountability and support networks.\n\nPutting this all together: the individual has some points that might raise concerns, like unemployment and past drug use. However, there are significant mitigating factors such as education, stable upbringing, no depression, and positive belief structures. The single arrest without conviction is a minor point. Overall, while not entirely risk-free, the positives seem to outweigh the negatives, suggesting a lower risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
