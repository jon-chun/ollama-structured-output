    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with evaluating this individual's risk based on the provided factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Typically, younger individuals might still be navigating life and could be more prone to impulsive decisions. But not everyone in their early twenties poses a high risk, so I'll consider other factors alongside this.\n\nHe's male. Statistically, males are more likely to be involved in criminal activities than females, though this can vary widely depending on context and culture.\n\nHispanic ethnicity\u2014again, while some studies might show higher arrest rates for certain groups, it's important not to generalize. Context matters a lot here.\n\nArrested twice and has convictions. This is significant because past behavior can be an indicator of future actions. Having been convicted suggests that he's had previous run-ins with the law, which could indicate a pattern or at least some propensity towards criminal behavior.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless there are specific concerns about physicality in relation to crimes, but I don't see any here.\n\nNever married, living alone. Some studies suggest that marital status can be protective against recidivism because of the support structure a marriage might provide. Living alone could mean less supervision or fewer accountability structures.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is often linked to employment opportunities. Lower education levels can correlate with higher unemployment rates, which in turn can sometimes lead to criminal activity as a means of income. However, this isn't a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. This could be positive if it indicates some stability or at least an attempt to maintain employment. It might suggest that he's trying to establish himself, but without knowing the nature of these jobs or any issues with them, it's hard to assess further.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, especially if it leads to dependency or if the individual is involved in activities to obtain drugs illegally. However, marijuana isn't as strongly linked to violent crime as other substances might be.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, so this could be a protective factor here. That said, mental health is complex and varies widely among individuals.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might influence exposure to criminal activities. Family structure\u2014living with both parents isn't always possible, but having a stable family environment can be protective.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism by providing a sense of purpose and accountability beyond societal norms.\n\nPutting it all together: the most significant factors are prior convictions and arrest history, lack of education, living alone without a support structure, and past drug use. These points lean towards higher risk. However, he's relatively young, has held jobs recently, isn't currently depressed, and has a spiritual belief system which might provide some protective elements.\n\nThe balance here tips more towards high risk because the negative factors like prior convictions and lack of education are strong indicators. But I'm not entirely certain, so my confidence is around 75%. That's pretty high but leaves room for other mitigating factors that aren't mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
