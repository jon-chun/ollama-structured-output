    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male to determine if he's high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. I remember from some studies that younger individuals are sometimes associated with higher crime rates, but this can vary based on other factors.\n\nHe identifies as Black. There might be systemic issues affecting this community, which could influence arrest and conviction rates, though it's important to consider each case individually.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. That's a bit confusing because an arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily mean he has a criminal record, so maybe that's less risky than if he had convictions.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. I don't see how physical stature directly relates to risk here unless there's something about it being underweight or tall, but nothing stands out in the info given.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if someone is isolated, but he has held two jobs, which might indicate some stability.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school equivalency is positive, though not pursuing higher education could be a missed opportunity, but it's not inherently risky.\n\nTwo jobs over the year shows responsibility and employment consistency, which are generally protective factors against crime.\n\nNo drug use for four years and no recent depression symptoms. That's good because substance abuse and mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nLived in a household of two when young. Smaller households aren't inherently bad; it depends on the environment and support structures, which we don't have details about here.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any role in his life. Religious involvement or lack thereof can be complex\u2014some studies suggest that religious individuals might have lower crime rates, but this varies widely and isn't a clear indicator alone.\n\nPutting it all together: he's young, which could be a factor, arrested once without conviction, employed, no drugs, stable mentally, educated but not in college. The lack of convictions is positive, employment shows responsibility, mental health seems okay. So overall, despite being male and Black, the other factors seem protective or neutral. Therefore, I think he's low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
