    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. The person is a 22-year-old female, white, arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'9\", 160 lbs, divorced, not living alone, has a GED, no college enrollment, held one job in the past year, hasn't used drugs in four years. Recently, she's felt very down. Lived in a household of three when young and doesn't believe God affects her personally.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each factor:\n\n1. Age: 22 is relatively young. Some studies show that younger individuals might be at higher risk for certain crimes, especially if there are other factors involved.\n\n2. Gender: Female. Generally, females have lower crime rates than males, but this can vary based on circumstances.\n\n3. Race: White. This alone isn't a risk factor, but it's part of the profile.\n\n4. Arrest history: One arrest, no conviction. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, so this is a minor point unless there's more context.\n\n5. Marital status: Divorced. Divorce can sometimes be associated with higher stress and potential for criminal behavior if other factors are present.\n\n6. Living situation: Not living alone. This could provide some support but might also limit personal space or increase stress depending on the circumstances.\n\n7. Education: GED, not in college. A high school equivalency is a positive, but not pursuing further education could be a sign of limited opportunities or motivation.\n\n8. Employment: Held one job in the past year. Consistent employment can be protective against crime, unless there are issues with the job itself.\n\n9. Drug use: No drugs in four years. This is a strong protective factor against drug-related crimes and indicates some level of stability.\n\n10. Mental health: Felt very down recently. Depression or low mood can sometimes correlate with higher risk if untreated, as it might lead to impulsive behavior or substance abuse (though she hasn't used drugs).\n\n11. Household size when young: 3 members. This doesn't directly indicate risk unless there were issues in the household.\n\n12. Belief about God: Doesn't think God affects her personally. This could relate to a lack of religious coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting this together, most factors are neutral or protective except for the recent mental health struggles. However, without other significant red flags like a history of violence, multiple arrests, drug use, or unstable living conditions, the overall risk might be moderate rather than high. The lack of drug use and having a job provide some stability. Her feeling down could be a concern but isn't necessarily indicative of high risk without more context.\n\nI think the confidence level would reflect that while there are some concerns, they aren't strong enough to indicate a high-risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
