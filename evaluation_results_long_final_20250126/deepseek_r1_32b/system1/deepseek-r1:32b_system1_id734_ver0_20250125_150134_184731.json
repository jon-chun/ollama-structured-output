    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this person's risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male, which might be a moderate factor since males in their early twenties can sometimes have higher tendencies for certain behaviors, but it's not inherently high risk on its own.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race alone isn't typically a risk factor unless there are systemic issues at play, which I don't think apply here. So that's probably neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. This is a significant red flag because prior convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to future offenses. Four arrests suggest some level of involvement with the law, even if only one conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 215 lbs. Physical build isn't usually a risk factor unless it's related to specific crimes, which it doesn't seem to be here. So that might not add much to the assessment.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living situation can sometimes indicate stability. Being single and living alone could mean less supervision or fewer accountability structures, but this varies widely depending on individual circumstances. It's a consideration rather than a direct risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment is usually positive, showing some level of engagement and future-oriented thinking. However, being enrolled might mean he's still developing his career path, which could be either stable or uncertain depending on other factors.\n\nNo jobs held during the year. This is concerning because unemployment can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors due to financial stress or lack of structured daily activities. It might indicate some instability or barriers to employment that could influence behavior.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and recently felt down, indicating possible mental health issues. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be a marker for other risky behaviors or underlying issues. The recent low mood suggests potential depression or stress, which can sometimes lead to coping mechanisms like substance use or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of six. Larger family size isn't inherently bad, but it might indicate less individual attention or different dynamics that could affect behavior development. However, this is more speculative and depends on the specific family environment.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes serve as a support system or influence decision-making. The absence of such belief might not directly correlate with risk but could indicate other aspects of his personality or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators, substance use is another concern, unemployment adds stress, and possible mental health issues could exacerbate these factors. The educational background is a positive point, but the combination of legal history, drug use, and lack of employment stability leans towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
