    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. So, the individual is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's the first point. I know that age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing impulse control and decision-making skills. But being White in itself doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there are other factors at play.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and prior convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending. The type of offenses might matter, but since it's not specified, we'll consider the quantity and history as a risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight is 135 lbs. Physically, he doesn't stand out in any particular way that would contribute to risk, so this probably isn't a significant factor here.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a neutral factor, but combined with other issues like mental health or substance abuse, it might indicate a lack of support systems which could increase risk.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence job prospects and overall stability. Without further education, especially in today's economy, finding stable employment can be challenging, which might lead to increased stress or involvement in criminal activities if not managed well.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year. That seems like a high turnover rate. Frequent job changes could indicate issues with reliability, workplace behavior, or substance use interfering with work performance. It's possible that this instability contributes to his current situation and could be linked to other risk factors.\n\nSubstance abuse is another major factor here. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has been feeling extremely down for the last month. This combination suggests potential drug dependence or addiction, which can impair judgment, lead to risky behavior, and increase the likelihood of criminal activity as a means to sustain substance use.\n\nLooking back at his upbringing, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. A stable family environment during childhood is generally protective against delinquency, but if there were underlying issues within that family (which aren't mentioned here), it might still have contributed. However, based on the information given, this seems like a neutral or slightly protective factor.\n\nHe doesn't consider God to be involved in his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or guidance, which some studies suggest can correlate with higher risk behaviors if there's no other strong support system in place.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests and convictions, substance abuse, recent feelings of depression, frequent job changes, living alone without apparent support systems\u2014all point towards a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior. The combination of past behavior (convictions), current issues (substance use, mental health symptoms), and limited social supports make this individual a high-risk case.\n\nThe confidence level is pretty high because the number of risk factors present is significant and each contributes to an increased probability of reoffending or engaging in further criminal activity. However, without knowing specifics like the nature of the prior convictions or the exact substance use patterns (frequency, quantity), there's some uncertainty. But given the information provided, it leans heavily towards a high-risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
