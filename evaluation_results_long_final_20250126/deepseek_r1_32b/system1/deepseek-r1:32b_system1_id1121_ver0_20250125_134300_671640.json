    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills, but race shouldn't inherently indicate risk unless there's systemic bias involved, which I should be cautious about.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could suggest some involvement with the law, maybe minor infractions or false accusations. It doesn't necessarily mean he's high risk, but it's a point to consider.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 135 lbs. Physical stature alone isn't really a risk factor unless there's context about how that relates to his behavior or environment, which there isn't here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with less social support, but it's not a direct indicator of risk. It depends on the circumstances\u2014like if he's alone because he's struggling socially or economically.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to future opportunities. Without education, there might be limited job prospects, which could lead to other issues like unemployment or involvement in illegal activities out of necessity. But he hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if someone isn't engaged in productive activities.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. These are positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are often linked to higher risk profiles, so his current state is a mitigating factor.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in an urban environment can have both pros and cons\u2014more opportunities but also potentially more exposure to crime or gang activity. However, this isn't directly indicative of personal risk without more context about the neighborhood's crime rate or family dynamics.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any impact on his life. This is a religious/spiritual factor, which can influence behavior. Some studies suggest that individuals with strong religious beliefs might have lower engagement in risky behaviors. However, the absence of belief doesn't automatically make someone high risk; it's more about how they navigate their values and choices without that framework.\n\nPutting all this together: he has some factors that could potentially indicate higher risk, like arrest history and lack of education/jobs, but there are also mitigating factors such as no current drug use or depression. The confidence in predicting him as high risk isn't extremely high because while there are red flags, the absence of active substance abuse and mental health issues reduces the overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
