    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills and are more prone to engage in risky behaviors. However, gender might not be as significant here, but race could potentially impact risk based on societal factors, though that's a sensitive area.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and has a conviction. That definitely raises some flags. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that leads to legal issues. The fact that she was convicted means there was a successful prosecution, showing that her actions met the criteria for criminal charges.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 1 inch, and weight is 135 lbs. I'm not sure if these physical attributes play much into risk assessment, but maybe body type could relate to other factors like substance abuse or health issues, which might influence behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and currently lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a red flag because it might indicate limited social support. However, being unmarried at 18 isn't unusual, so I don't know if that's a significant factor on its own.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates because education can provide better opportunities and reduce the likelihood of returning to criminal activities. Without formal education, she might face more challenges finding stable employment, which could increase her risk of reoffending.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. That shows some level of employability, but holding multiple short-term jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining consistent work. It could also mean she's looking for better opportunities, but without knowing the duration and reasons for job changes, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor because substance abuse is often correlated with criminal behavior. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so this might not carry as much weight as other substances.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health plays a role in recidivism; untreated depression or other mental illnesses can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. The fact that she's not currently feeling depressed could be a positive sign, but we don't know about her history or current mental state beyond this point.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Family structure and environment can influence behavior. Growing up in an urban area might expose her to different factors compared to rural areas, but the specifics aren't provided here.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism by providing a sense of purpose or guidance. However, this is subjective and varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: she's young, has a history of arrests and conviction, lacks formal education, uses marijuana, and lives alone without immediate family support. These factors collectively might indicate a higher risk, especially the criminal history and educational attainment. However, her current mental state not being depressed and having some employment history could slightly mitigate that risk.\n\nI think the prediction would lean towards high risk because of the combination of arrest/conviction history and lack of education. The confidence level is probably around 70-80% since there are mitigating factors like no depression and some job experience, but the criminal record is a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
