    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, which in some contexts might be considered a higher-risk demographic because of age-related statistics. However, being white and having only one arrest that led to conviction isn't necessarily a huge red flag. The fact that he's had one job during the year suggests some level of stability, though it's just one job. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might limit his future opportunities but doesn't directly indicate risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently, so those are positive signs. Living alone could be neutral or slightly concerning depending on other factors, but he's been living that way without issues mentioned. His background includes a large household with his biological mother, which might have had its challenges but doesn't inherently make him high risk.\n\nHe also mentions that God has something to do with what happens to him, indicating some religious involvement, which can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates. \n\nPutting it all together, the main factors pointing towards higher risk are his age and prior conviction. But considering he's only had one arrest, no recent drug use or depression, and a stable job, those might mitigate the risk. So overall, I'm leaning towards low risk but not entirely confident because of the prior conviction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
