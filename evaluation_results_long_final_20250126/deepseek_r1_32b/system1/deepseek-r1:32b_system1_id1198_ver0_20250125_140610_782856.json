    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence behavior. However, being Black alone shouldn't indicate risk without context.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes reflect interactions with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if these were justified or justifiable. It might suggest some legal issues but doesn't confirm criminal activity.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and between 150-174 lbs. These are average stats and don't indicate anything about risk unless there's a specific reason, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a factor if it leads to isolation or lack of support systems, but that's not always the case. It might just mean he's independent.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment can correlate with opportunities and future stability. Not being enrolled in higher education might limit job prospects, which could lead to issues if employment is unstable.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment history can be a protective factor if steady, but holding only one job might not provide enough financial stability or routine, especially for someone just starting out.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression symptoms are positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues can increase risk factors, so their absence is beneficial.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but that's not always indicative of personal behavior. Household size being small might mean less supervision or different dynamics, but again, context matters.\n\nHe considers God influential in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and guidance, which are protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are some points that could be seen as potential risks (arrests, no higher education, living alone), the lack of convictions, no drug use, stable mental health, and religious involvement seem to mitigate those risks. The predictive factors don't strongly indicate a high risk for criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
