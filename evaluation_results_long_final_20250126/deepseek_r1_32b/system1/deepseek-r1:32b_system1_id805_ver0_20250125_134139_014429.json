    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, which might be a moderate factor since males are overrepresented in crime statistics, but age could work both ways\u2014sometimes as people get older, they tend to commit fewer crimes.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race is a sensitive topic and shouldn't be a determining factor on its own. So I won't give this much weight unless other factors come into play.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. This seems significant because past criminal behavior can predict future behavior. However, the number of arrests isn't extremely high, so it might not be the strongest indicator alone.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 170 lbs. I don't think physical attributes like these are major risk factors unless there's something else indicating he uses his size for criminal activity, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone could sometimes be a factor if there's no support system or if the person feels isolated, but it's not necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can be protective; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. So this might actually lower his risk score.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. That could indicate instability or a tendency to move between jobs quickly, which might not be ideal but isn't directly linked to criminal behavior without more context.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive because substance abuse can often lead to criminal activities. So this factor would lean towards lower risk.\n\nHowever, he has felt so down that nothing could cheer him up some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can sometimes correlate with increased risk behaviors if untreated or severe enough. But without more details on the severity and treatment, it's hard to assess how much this impacts his risk level.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. Family stability is generally protective against delinquency, so this would be another positive factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and moral framework that might deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some factors that could indicate higher risk (past arrests/convictions, current mental health issues) but also several protective factors (education, stable upbringing, no drug use). The two prior convictions are the most concerning, but they aren't extremely severe. His recent mental state might be a warning sign, but without more info on how he's handling it or any history of violent behavior, it's not clear-cut.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" because the protective factors seem to outweigh the risk factors, especially considering his education and stable background. The confidence level would be in the moderate range since there are some red flags that could tip the scale if more information were available.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
