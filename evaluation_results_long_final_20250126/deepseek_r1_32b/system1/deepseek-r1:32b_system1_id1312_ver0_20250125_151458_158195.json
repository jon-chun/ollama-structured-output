    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors. Race shouldn't inherently be a risk factor, but I need to consider any systemic issues that might affect him.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could indicate some contact with the law, maybe a minor offense or something dismissed later. It shows he has had some interaction with the criminal justice system, which is a point of consideration.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'11\" and 158 lbs. That's average for his age, so probably not a significant risk factor unless there's context about health issues, but nothing is mentioned here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being single isn't necessarily a risk factor, but living alone might reduce supervision or support networks. However, it's not clear if this affects his behavior positively or negatively.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level can be an indicator of future opportunities. Without education, the person might face challenges finding stable employment, which could lead to other issues if they're not employed.\n\nHe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment is often linked with higher crime rates because it can lead to financial stress and lack of structured time. This is a significant risk factor as it suggests he's without income or regular activities, increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities for money or out of boredom.\n\nDrug use within the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse, especially harder drugs like cocaine, is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior. Drug dependency can lead to crimes such as theft or dealing to sustain habits. Cocaine's higher risk compared to marijuana makes this another critical point.\n\nNo depression in the past month. While mental health issues are important, the absence here might mean he doesn't have that particular stressor. However, other factors could influence his behavior regardless of mental state.\n\nHe grew up in a large household (11 people) in a rural area with his biological mother. Growing up in a crowded environment might lead to less individual attention and supervision. Rural areas can sometimes have fewer resources or higher crime rates, depending on the specific location.\n\nBelieves God doesn't influence personal events. This could indicate a lack of religious guidance or community support that religion often provides. However, not believing in divine intervention isn't inherently risky but might mean he lacks certain coping mechanisms or social networks that others with religious beliefs might have.\n\nPutting it all together: Arrest history (even without conviction), unemployment, drug use (especially cocaine), living alone, and low education are significant risk factors. These points suggest higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of structure, support, and opportunities. The absence of mental health issues doesn't negate the other risks. Therefore, he should be considered high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
