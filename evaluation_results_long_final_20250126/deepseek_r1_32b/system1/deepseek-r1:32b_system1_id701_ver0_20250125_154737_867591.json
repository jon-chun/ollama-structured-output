    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female identifying as White. Age-wise, younger individuals might be at a higher risk because they're still developing and could make impulsive decisions. However, being female generally might lower risk compared to males, who statistically have higher crime rates. But I'm not sure how significant this is.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest without conviction suggests some level of legal involvement, which could indicate a potential risk factor. However, it's just one arrest and no conviction, so maybe not as high as someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem to be directly related to risk factors, so I can probably ignore those.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone might be neutral or could indicate some level of independence, but it's also possible that lack of support from a spouse or family could be a factor. However, being single doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education-wise, having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit future opportunities. This could potentially lead to frustration if job prospects are limited, which might increase risk, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can sometimes be a red flag because it might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This could suggest issues with responsibility or adaptability, which might relate to higher risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana is a controlled substance, and using it can lead to other risky behaviors or dependencies. However, marijuana's impact on criminal behavior isn't as severe as harder drugs, but any drug use could be an indicator of potential issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of depression symptoms might lower risk because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors when unaddressed. So this is a positive factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable upbringing with both parents present could be protective against high-risk behavior, which would lower the overall risk assessment.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with her personal events. Lack of religious affiliation or belief might not directly indicate risk but could be part of a broader picture if it reflects other attitudes or behaviors. However, this is a more subjective factor and may not hold much weight in statistical analysis.\n\nPutting all these together: she's young, female, one arrest without conviction, living alone, four jobs, marijuana use, no depression, stable upbringing, no religious influence. The factors that might indicate higher risk are the arrest history (even without conviction), frequent job changes, and drug use. However, these aren't necessarily strong indicators on their own, especially since she's not convicted and doesn't have other significant red flags like a history of violence or multiple offenses.\n\nI think overall, while there are some factors that could suggest moderate risk, they don't seem to add up to high risk when considering the protective factors like stable upbringing, education, no depression. So my prediction would be NO, with a confidence level reflecting that it's not extremely low but also not very high.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}",
