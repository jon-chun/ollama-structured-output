    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best to analyze the given risk factors.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female, mixed race. Age-wise, she's young, which might be a neutral factor. Being female could sometimes indicate lower risk in certain contexts, though it really depends on other factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a point of concern because even an arrest without conviction can suggest some level of involvement with the law. But since there's no conviction, maybe the charge wasn't proven or she was acquitted, so that might be less concerning than if she had a conviction.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'6\" and 124 lbs. That doesn't seem to directly relate to risk factors unless there's something about her physical condition, but nothing here stands out in terms of health risks.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Generally, being in a stable relationship can be a protective factor, indicating more support and less likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. So that might lower the risk assessment.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk because it might limit job opportunities and increase stressors. However, this isn't always directly indicative, so it's a moderate concern.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another factor that can contribute to higher risk, as financial instability can lead to stress or engagement in illegal activities as a means of income. This is definitely a point to consider.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is good. That reduces the likelihood of substance-related issues contributing to criminal behavior. However, she mentioned feeling down at times, especially recently. Mental health struggles can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if not managed properly, so that's another factor to weigh.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Not sure if that's relevant here unless it indicates something about her upbringing or environment, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with personal events. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be another factor contributing to stress or feelings of helplessness, especially combined with the mental health aspects mentioned earlier.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some protective factors like being married and not currently using drugs. However, there are several risk factors such as arrest history (even without conviction), unemployment, lack of education, recent mental health issues, and possibly a challenging upbringing. The combination might suggest a moderate to high risk, but since the protective factors are present, maybe it's on the lower end of high risk.\n\nI think the confidence level should be around 65% because while there are multiple red flags, some mitigating factors like no drug use and being married provide some balance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
