    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm analyzing the risk factors for an 18-year-old female and determining if they indicate high risk based on my knowledge as a criminal justice risk assessment expert.\n\nFirst, I'll note her demographics: she's an 18-year-old mixed-race female. Age is a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills. However, being female also typically correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That single arrest doesn't necessarily indicate high risk since there's no conviction, which usually carries more weight in risk assessments. But it does show some level of past interaction with the legal system.\n\nHer physical description\u20145'5\" and 120 lbs\u2014isn't particularly relevant to risk assessment unless there are health issues involved, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a neutral factor or might indicate independence, but without more context about her support system, it's hard to assess the impact on risk.\n\nShe's enrolled in school and has held two jobs in the past year. Education and employment are generally protective factors against criminal behavior. Being active in education suggests she's investing in her future, which is a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years, but I don't have information on how frequently or if it's problematic. Marijuana use alone isn't necessarily indicative of high risk unless it's chronic or leading to other issues.\n\nShe reported feeling down for some time in the past month, to the point where nothing could cheer her up. This indicates possible depression or mental health struggles. Mental health issues can sometimes be associated with higher risks if they lead to substance abuse or other coping mechanisms that might result in criminal activity.\n\nFamily background: She grew up in a household of six people. Larger family size doesn't inherently indicate risk, but it could mean she had less individual attention or more challenges growing up, which might influence her behavior.\n\nShe considers God significant in her personal life. This suggests she has some form of spiritual support or belief system, which can be protective and contribute to positive decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together: There are a few risk factors like the arrest history and possible mental health issues. However, there are several protective factors such as being enrolled in school, having held jobs, no prior convictions, and having a belief system. The marijuana use is present but not necessarily severe unless it's impacting her daily life or education, which isn't detailed here.\n\nGiven these considerations, the risk doesn't seem high enough to warrant a \"YES\" prediction with confidence. Therefore, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
