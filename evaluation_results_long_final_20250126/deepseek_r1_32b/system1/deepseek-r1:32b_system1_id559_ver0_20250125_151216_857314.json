    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence decision-making and behavior. Males statistically have higher arrest rates, so that's another point to consider.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments, though it's important to approach this carefully to avoid bias. However, in some models, race might still be considered alongside other variables.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested three times and has a conviction. This is significant because past behavior is often used to predict future actions. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior, which can be a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nPhysical characteristics\u20146 feet 1 inch and 215 lbs. While size alone isn't indicative of risk, it could play a role in the likelihood of physical altercations or the perception of threat by others.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone might reduce supervision and support systems, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors without accountability from others.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be inversely related to criminal behavior; lower education levels are sometimes associated with higher crime rates, though this isn't always the case.\n\nEmployment history: Held two jobs in a year. Job stability could vary\u2014holding multiple jobs might indicate either instability or adaptability. It's unclear without more context whether this is positive or negative.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use over the past four years and feeling down recently. Substance abuse, even if it's marijuana, can impair judgment and increase involvement in risky behaviors. Additionally, feelings of depression or hopelessness could lead to poor decision-making or increased stress, which might exacerbate other risk factors.\n\nGrowing up in a household of seven. Large family size might correlate with lower supervision, potential for neglect, or economic challenges, all of which can contribute to higher risk behaviors if not managed well.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has an influence on his life. Religious affiliation is sometimes associated with lower crime rates as it can provide a moral framework and social support. However, this isn't always the case, especially if religious beliefs aren't actively practiced or supported by a community.\n\nPutting all these together: He has a criminal history, which is a major red flag. His substance use and recent depressive symptoms could increase impulsivity or risky behavior. Living alone without supervision might also contribute to higher risk. On the other hand, he's employed, educated up to high school, and has religious beliefs that might offer some support.\n\nHowever, considering all these factors, especially the arrest history and current mental health indicators, it seems more likely than not that this individual presents a high risk. The confidence level would be fairly high because of the combination of multiple significant factors like prior convictions, substance use, and depression.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
