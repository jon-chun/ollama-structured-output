    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 19-year-old male, which might be relevant because younger individuals are sometimes more involved in criminal activities, but that's not always the case. He identifies as White, which I don't think directly correlates with risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant point. Having prior convictions is often a strong indicator of higher risk because it shows a history of engaging in illegal behavior. The fact that he's been arrested multiple times might suggest a pattern or inclination towards such activities.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145'8\" and 170 lbs.\u2014don't seem to be red flags on their own. They're average for his age, so probably not relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there might be less supervision or support from others. However, this isn't always the case. It depends on other factors as well.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can play a role; some studies suggest that lower education levels correlate with higher crime rates, but again, this varies widely among individuals.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally a positive factor because it provides stability and income. However, holding multiple jobs could be either good or bad depending on context\u2014maybe he's seeking stable employment, or perhaps it indicates instability if he's frequently changing jobs.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can be a risk factor as it might impair judgment or lead to other risky behaviors. However, marijuana is less severe compared to harder drugs, so this might not carry as much weight as other factors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior when untreated.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. Family stability is generally a protective factor. Growing up in a two-parent home might reduce some risks, but since he's living alone now, that protective factor isn't present anymore.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal events. This could indicate lower levels of religious involvement or spirituality, which are sometimes associated with higher risk behaviors because religion can provide a moral framework and support systems.\n\nPutting all this together: prior convictions (especially multiple arrests) is the strongest indicator here. The other factors like living alone, substance use, lack of college enrollment, and urban upbringing might add to the risk but aren't as significant on their own. So overall, I think there's a moderate to high risk indicated by these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
