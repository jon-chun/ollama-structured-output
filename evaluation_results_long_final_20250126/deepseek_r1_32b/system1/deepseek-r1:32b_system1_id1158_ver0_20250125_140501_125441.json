    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male and determine if they indicate high risk. The prediction should be either \"YES\" or \"NO\", along with a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age (21 years old)**: Young adults are generally at higher risk for certain criminal behaviors because of factors like peer influence, impulsivity, etc. So this might be a point towards high risk.\n\n2. **Gender (Male)**: Statistically, males are more likely to engage in criminal activities than females. This adds another factor toward high risk.\n\n3. **Ethnicity (Hispanic)**: While ethnicity alone isn't indicative of risk, certain communities may face systemic issues that could influence behavior. However, this should be considered carefully and not overemphasized without context.\n\n4. **Arrest Record (7 arrests, no convictions)**: Multiple arrests suggest some level of involvement in illegal activities, even without convictions. This is a significant factor leaning towards high risk.\n\n5. **Physical Attributes (6'2\", 215 lbs.)**: Not directly related to criminal behavior, but could influence certain types of crimes or interactions with law enforcement. Not the strongest indicator on its own.\n\n6. **Marital Status (Never married, not living alone)**: Living with others might provide some social support, which can be protective against high-risk behaviors. However, lack of marriage isn't necessarily a risk factor unless combined with other issues.\n\n7. **Education and Employment**: High school diploma and enrolled in college suggest some level of education. Holding one job during the year indicates at least some stability. These are positive factors that might mitigate risk.\n\n8. **Drug Use (Marijuana past 4 years)**: Substance use can be associated with higher risk behaviors, especially if it's a regular or problematic use. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so this might not contribute as much as harder substances.\n\n9. **Mental Health (No depression in the past month)**: Absence of recent depressive symptoms could indicate lower stress or mental health issues that sometimes correlate with criminal behavior. This is a protective factor.\n\n10. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4. Stable family upbringing can be protective, but if there were issues within the household, it might have contributed differently. The information given doesn't specify any negative factors here.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: Considers God's influence on personal events. Religious involvement is often associated with lower crime rates, as it can provide a moral framework and community support. This is another protective factor.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- Positive factors (lower risk): Education, employment, no recent depression, religious beliefs, stable family background.\n- Negative factors (higher risk): Multiple arrests, young age, male gender, drug use.\n\nThe arrest record stands out as a significant indicator because it shows repeated contact with the criminal justice system. However, he hasn't been convicted, which might suggest either luck or that charges were dropped, but still, 7 arrests are notable.\n\nHis education and current enrollment in college could be mitigating factors, showing some level of responsibility and future orientation. The lack of depression and religious beliefs also provide some protective elements.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a \"YES\" for high risk because the arrest history is quite substantial, even without convictions. However, the presence of positive factors might lower the confidence level compared to someone with only negative indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
