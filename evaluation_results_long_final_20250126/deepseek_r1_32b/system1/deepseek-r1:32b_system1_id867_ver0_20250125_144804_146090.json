    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm analyzing the risk factors provided for a 19-year-old male and determining whether he poses a high risk based on these indicators.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Statistically, younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors or reoffend compared to older adults. This factor leans towards higher risk.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can indicate potential behavioral issues, even without a conviction. The fact that he's been arrested multiple times suggests some level of involvement in problematic activities.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year, which is somewhat stable employment. Having a job can be a protective factor against criminal behavior because it provides structure and financial stability. This might lower his risk compared to someone who is unemployed.\n\nHe identifies as White, which may not directly correlate with risk but could be relevant in some contexts. However, this isn't a primary indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nLiving alone at 19 without being married can sometimes indicate less social support or supervision, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This factor tips towards higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can influence future opportunities. Without further education, he may face challenges that could contribute to stress or other factors influencing behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially at a young age, can be linked to other risky behaviors or mental health issues. This is another factor pointing towards higher risk.\n\nHe reported feeling down and nothing could cheer him up some days in the past month. This indicates possible depression or anxiety, which are mental health issues that can influence behavior and decision-making, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban household of four. Family background might provide some context, but without more information on family dynamics or support systems, it's hard to assess the impact. Urban living could expose him to different environments that may influence behavior.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with personal events. This lack of religious affiliation might remove a potential protective factor that faith can provide in terms of social support and moral guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, drug use, mental health symptoms, living alone without family support, younger age, and limited education point towards higher risk factors. However, having held two jobs provides some stability which could mitigate the risk somewhat. The confidence level is high because several key indicators are present that are commonly associated with elevated risk in criminal justice assessments.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
