    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Young adults are often still developing and can be more impulsive, which might increase risk factors. But not necessarily always high risk.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I don't think race or ethnicity alone should determine risk unless there's specific data showing higher rates in that group for whatever offense we're assessing. So maybe this factor is neutral or needs more context.\n\nSix arrests and at least one conviction. That seems significant. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that's come to the attention of law enforcement, and a conviction means he's been found guilty of something. This could suggest higher risk because it shows repeated involvement in illegal activities.\n\nHeight is 5'6\", weight between 150-174 lbs. That seems average; doesn't indicate any particular risk factor unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe being underweight or overweight which can sometimes correlate with other issues, but here it's within a normal range.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor. Not being married is neutral on its own, but combined with living alone, it might suggest less accountability or social ties that could help manage behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be a significant factor. Lower education levels are sometimes linked to higher crime rates because of limited opportunities and potential for frustration or turning to illegal activities as an alternative.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment history is important. If he only has one job in a year, it might indicate instability, but having any job could be protective if it provides some structure and income. However, frequent job changes can sometimes correlate with higher risk because of issues maintaining consistent work.\n\nDrug use: cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is definitely a red flag. Drug use can impair judgment, lead to involvement in criminal activities to sustain the habit, and generally increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health plays a role, but if he's not currently depressed, that might be protective. However, substance use could still impact mental health indirectly or indicate other issues.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with his biological mother in a household of four. Family background can be complex. Growing up in a stable family environment is usually positive, but living in a rural area might have different crime dynamics compared to urban areas, but that's speculative without more data.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and support system. But it depends on how this belief influences his behavior; if it promotes positive actions, it could lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The significant factors pointing towards higher risk are multiple arrests/convictions, drug use, lack of education, and unstable employment. These can contribute to higher recidivism rates because they indicate a pattern of behavior that's more likely to continue without intervention. On the other hand, living with family in the past, religious beliefs, not currently being depressed might act as some protective factors, but the negatives seem to outweigh them.\n\nSo my prediction is high risk, and I'm fairly confident based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
