    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment step by step. The individual is a 22-year-old male, which falls within a demographic often associated with higher crime rates, though age alone isn't determinative. His ethnicity as White doesn't inherently indicate risk but could be part of broader societal factors.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted at least once. This criminal history suggests a pattern of behavior that could increase future risk. The number of arrests indicates repeated interactions with the justice system, which is a significant red flag.\n\nHis physical build\u20146'5\" and 210 lbs.\u2014could be relevant in certain contexts, such as violent crimes, but without specific charges related to this, it's less impactful on its own.\n\nLiving alone might pose some risks if there's a lack of social support or supervision. However, being single isn't inherently risky unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe has a GED and hasn't pursued higher education beyond that. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so the lack of further education could be a concern. Employment history shows he's held one job in the past year, which is somewhat limited but not necessarily indicative of risk unless there are issues with job stability or performance.\n\nSubstance use\u2014marijuana and cocaine over the past four years\u2014is a significant factor. Drug use can impair judgment, lead to risky behaviors, and contribute to criminal activity. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently might mitigate some mental health risks but doesn't address the substance abuse issue.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four suggests a somewhat stable upbringing, which could be protective. His religious beliefs\u2014acknowledging God's influence\u2014might provide some moral framework or support, which can be positive in terms of risk assessment.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: criminal history, substance abuse, limited education and employment, living alone, and age are all elements that point towards a higher risk of recidivism. The presence of multiple risk factors, especially the criminal record and drug use, significantly elevates the concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
