    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old male, which might be a neutral factor since age alone doesn't necessarily indicate risk. Being White could relate to certain demographic risk factors, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant red flag because past convictions are often strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight is 130 lbs. Not sure how that plays into risk assessment, maybe physical stature could be a factor in certain crimes, but it's not a major one here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes indicate stability; being single and alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor if the person feels isolated.\n\nHas a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is mixed\u2014high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit future opportunities, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment stability can vary; holding multiple jobs could indicate job-hopping or financial instability, which might be a concern.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years and recently felt down. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, is a risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to other issues. Feeling down could indicate mental health struggles, which are also linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nGrew up with biological dad in an urban area. Family background might play a role; living in urban areas can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, but this isn't always the case.\n\nBelieves God influences personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a protective factor against risky behavior, so that might be positive.\n\nPutting it all together: past conviction is the strongest indicator of high risk. Substance use and recent mental health struggles also add to the risk factors. The other points like living alone and education are less impactful but still contribute. So, I think this person does present a higher than average risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
