    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male, which statistically can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally. Being White doesn't inherently indicate risk but could be relevant in certain contexts.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that's likely to result in reoffending. Convictions especially show that he's engaged in illegal activities that have led to legal consequences, which is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nAt 6 feet tall and weighing 155 lbs, his physical build might not directly correlate with risk, but it could be relevant if considering factors like the ability to commit certain crimes or escape from authorities. However, without more context, this doesn't add much to the risk assessment.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse or children can sometimes indicate limited social support, which is another risk factor. Social isolation might reduce accountability and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. No high school diploma or GED suggests educational challenges, which can limit opportunities for stable employment. This lack of education is often linked with higher crime rates because it reduces legitimate pathways to success.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment history can be a risk factor as it may lead to financial stress and involvement in criminal activities to meet financial needs. Drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, is another major red flag. Substance abuse is strongly correlated with criminal behavior, both as a contributing factor and as a result of underlying issues.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently might seem positive, but mental health can fluctuate. It's possible that other emotional or psychological factors aren't being addressed here. Living in an urban area could mean exposure to higher crime rates or environments that encourage delinquency, though this isn't always the case.\n\nHe has a religious belief, considering God\u2019s influence on his life. This might provide some level of moral guidance and support, which can be protective against reoffending. However, the presence of this factor alone doesn't outweigh the significant negative indicators like multiple arrests, substance use, lack of education, and unstable employment.\n\nPutting it all together: The individual has a history of repeated arrests and convictions, uses drugs, lacks formal education, has limited social support, and unstable employment\u2014all factors that typically contribute to higher recidivism rates. While some protective factors exist (like religious beliefs), the overall pattern strongly suggests high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
