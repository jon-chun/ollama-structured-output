    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this person's risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female, which might be a lower risk category compared to older individuals or males, but age alone isn't everything. She identifies as White; I'm not sure how that plays into risk assessment, but maybe it's just background info.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That arrest could indicate some level of involvement in illegal activities, even if she wasn't convicted. Maybe she was charged with something minor or the case didn't go through. Either way, an arrest is a point to consider.\n\nHer height and weight are average\u20145'5\" and 127 lbs. Not sure how that factors into risk unless it's related to substance use or other health issues, but it might not be directly relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone now. Living alone could mean she has less supervision or support, which might contribute to higher risk if she's making poor decisions without guidance. On the other hand, being independent isn't inherently bad.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can be protective against criminal behavior because it provides structure and opportunities. However, if she's struggling academically or balancing work and school, that could add stress.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment is generally a good indicator of stability and lower risk. Having a steady job might reduce the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities for financial reasons. But it depends on how stable the job is and if she's satisfied with it.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. This is a significant red flag. Substance abuse, especially harder drugs like cocaine, can impair judgment, lead to risky behaviors, and increase the chance of involvement in criminal activities to sustain drug habits. It also affects mental health and overall stability.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's positive because mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors if they're untreated or causing distress. However, her lack of depression doesn't negate other risks.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both biological parents suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective. Family structure can influence behavior and decision-making, so having both parents around might have provided support and guidance that reduces risk.\n\nShe considers God as unrelated to her personal events. Religious or spiritual beliefs can sometimes serve as a coping mechanism and provide a sense of purpose, but the absence doesn't automatically mean higher risk. It just removes one potential protective factor.\n\nPutting this all together: she has some positive factors like being in school, employed, no depression, stable upbringing. But significant risks include past drug use (especially cocaine), living alone without supervision, an arrest history, and possible lack of a support system or alternative coping mechanisms due to her views on God's role. The substance abuse is a major concern because it can lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, she does present some high-risk indicators, especially the drug use and arrest history, which could suggest ongoing issues or potential for future problems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
