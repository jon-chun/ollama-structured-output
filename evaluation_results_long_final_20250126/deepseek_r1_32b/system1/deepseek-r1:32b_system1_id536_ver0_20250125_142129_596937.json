    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm analyzing this risk assessment for an 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 18, which is a young age. Young individuals might be more impulsive and less likely to have stable decision-making skills compared to older adults. That could indicate some risk.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that systemic biases can affect arrest rates and other factors, but on its own, race isn't a risk factor unless there's discrimination involved, which complicates things. So maybe this doesn't directly point to high risk but is something to note for context.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. An arrest without conviction could mean she was in the wrong place at the wrong time or that the charges weren't upheld. This might not be a strong indicator of high risk, but it's still worth considering as it shows some involvement with the law.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'7\" and 120 lbs. Physically, there's nothing here that stands out as a risk factor. It doesn't seem relevant to assessing criminal risk.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone could mean she has more autonomy, but it might also indicate less supervision or support. However, this isn't necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment can be a protective factor. Having a diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in higher education doesn't automatically make her high risk unless there's something else indicating instability or lack of opportunities.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job stability can vary; holding multiple jobs might indicate she's working hard to maintain herself, which is a good sign. Alternatively, it could suggest difficulty maintaining consistent employment, but without more context, this is neutral.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down in the dumps some days in the past month. Marijuana use can sometimes be associated with other risk factors or mental health issues. Feeling down might indicate depression or stress, which can influence behavior and decision-making. These are both concerns that could contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Family stability from living with both parents is generally protective. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but she's had a stable family environment, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nShe considers God important, which suggests she has a support system or belief structure that could provide emotional stability and reduce risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors that stand out as potential risks are her marijuana use, feelings of depression, and the arrest history. However, these are somewhat balanced by her educational background, family stability, and religious beliefs which act as protective factors. \n\nGiven this mix, I wouldn't classify her as high risk, but there are elements that require monitoring. The confidence isn't extremely low because some factors do point to possible vulnerabilities, but the protective factors are significant enough to lean towards a lower risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.
