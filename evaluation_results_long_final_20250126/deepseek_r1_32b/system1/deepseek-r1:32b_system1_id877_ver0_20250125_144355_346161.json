    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as White. Age can sometimes be a factor because younger individuals might have higher tendencies towards certain behaviors, but being White isn't typically a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could indicate some level of risk, especially if the arrest was for a serious offense. However, since there's no conviction, it's less clear. It might suggest that he had an encounter with law enforcement but wasn't found guilty, which could be due to various reasons.\n\nHe is 6 feet tall and weighs 155 lbs. His physical stature doesn't inherently indicate risk; it\u2019s more about how he uses his size or any associated behaviors.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a factor if there's instability in housing, but without additional context like eviction history or financial problems, this isn't a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is usually a protective factor against criminal behavior because higher education often correlates with better job prospects and lower crime rates.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Stable employment is another protective factor, suggesting responsibility and integration into society.\n\nNo drug use for the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the last month. Both of these are strong protective factors. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so not using drugs lowers the risk. Similarly, mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but his current state seems stable.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of four at a young age. Growing up in a two-parent home is typically protective because it often provides more stability and supervision during formative years.\n\nConsiders that God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a factor, but the absence of religious influence isn't necessarily a risk indicator unless other factors point towards behavioral issues related to lack of moral guidance, which isn't evident here.\n\nPutting it all together: The positive factors include education, employment, no substance use, stable upbringing, and mental health stability. Negative factors are the single arrest without conviction and living alone. However, the protective factors seem stronger than the risk factors. The arrest is a minor point unless we know more about it, but without a conviction, it's less impactful.\n\nTherefore, I would predict low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
