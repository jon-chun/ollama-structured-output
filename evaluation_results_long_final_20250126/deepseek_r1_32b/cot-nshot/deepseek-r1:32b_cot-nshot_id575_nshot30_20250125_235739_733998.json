    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 21. In the examples provided, people in their early twenties had various outcomes. Some with similar ages were predicted as YES and others as NO. So I think age alone isn't a strong indicator but might be low risk here since it's not extreme.\n\nEthnicity is White. The examples include both Black and White individuals. It seems that ethnicity doesn't consistently correlate to rearrest, so maybe this is a medium factor, though perhaps not the most significant.\n\nArrest history: he has been arrested once but not convicted. In some cases, prior arrests without convictions might be low risk, especially if there's no conviction. For example, in example 30, a similar arrest history led to NO prediction. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant based on the examples provided; they weren't mentioned as factors, so these are probably low.\n\nMarital status: he's not married but isn't living alone either. In some cases, living with others might be protective, like example 28 where not living alone was noted. So this could be a medium factor contributing to lower risk.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education typically reduces recidivism risk. Examples like 30 had similar educational status and were predicted as NO. This is a strong protective factor, so high weight here.\n\nEmployment: held four jobs in the year. High job stability or seeking employment might indicate better integration into society. However, frequent job changes could be seen negatively. In example 27, holding three jobs was associated with YES, but others like example 30 had similar numbers and were NO. So perhaps medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: none in the past four years. This is a significant protective factor since substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism. So high weight on this being low risk.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, so absence of them is positive, making this a medium to high protective factor.\n\nLiving situation: not living alone, which as mentioned earlier, might offer support and reduce risk, so medium factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God important. In some examples, religious affiliation was associated with lower recidivism, like example 30. So this is another protective factor, maybe medium to high.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of factors point towards a low risk of rearrest. The strong protective factors like education, no drug use, and stable living situation outweigh any potential risks from prior arrest or job changes. Therefore, I predict NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is within a typical range for rearrest risk but not particularly high or low on its own.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"White individuals in the examples had mixed outcomes; this factor isn't strongly predictive either way.\"),\n     (\"prior arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate lower risk compared to convictions.\"),\n     (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical measurements are not directly linked to rearrest risk in the provided data.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might offer support, reducing risk.\"),\n     (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Enrollment in college is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs suggest some instability but not necessarily high risk; examples vary with similar numbers.\"),\n     (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"No drug use significantly lowers rearrest risk as substance abuse is often linked to crime.\"),\n     (\"mental health status\", \"medium\", \"No depression indicates better emotional stability, reducing risk.\"),\n     (\"living arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may provide support and reduce recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"religious beliefs\", \"high\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor as seen in examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
