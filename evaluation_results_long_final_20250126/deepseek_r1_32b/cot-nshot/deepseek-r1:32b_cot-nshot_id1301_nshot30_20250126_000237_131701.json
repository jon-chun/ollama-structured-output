    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this case and assign weights to each. Let me start by looking at the individual details of the person in question.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female. Looking back at the examples, age seems important. Younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing. In some cases, being younger was a high risk factor. But I'm not sure if gender plays a role here; most examples didn't specify much about gender.\n\nShe's Black. Race is a sensitive topic, but in the examples, race wasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned as a factor. So maybe it doesn't carry much weight unless other factors influence it more.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. That seems significant. Having prior convictions, especially multiple ones, probably increases the risk. In example 27, someone with two arrests and one conviction had a \"YES\" outcome. So this should be high weight.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'1\", 135 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant in the examples I saw. They didn\u2019t mention anything about height or weight affecting recidivism, so maybe low weight here.\n\nNever married and living alone. In some cases, living situation matters. For example, if someone is living with family, it might provide support. But she's living alone at 18; that could be a risk factor because she might lack supervision or support. However, in the examples, not living alone didn't always prevent rearrest. So perhaps medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is definitely a factor. Without education, it's harder to find stable jobs, leading to higher crime rates. In example 27, lack of education was a high risk. So I'll mark this as high.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective if steady, but holding multiple short-term jobs might indicate instability. However, having any employment is better than none. Maybe medium weight because it's positive but not strong enough to counter other factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana. Substance abuse is a significant factor. In several examples, drug use was linked to higher recidivism. So this should be high.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Family environment can impact behavior. Growing up in an urban area might expose her to more crime opportunities or stressors. But without knowing the family dynamics beyond living with mom, it's hard to assess. Maybe medium weight because it could have both positive (stable home) and negative (urban risks) aspects.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a moral framework. In some examples, this was a low risk factor. So maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are prior convictions, lack of education, drug use. Medium factors include living alone and urban upbringing. Low factors are age (maybe), race, physical attributes, marital status, jobs, family situation, spirituality.\n\nThe high-weight factors strongly suggest a higher risk. She has multiple convictions, which is a strong indicator. Lack of education and drug use add to that. Even though she's young and employed, the negatives outweigh these positives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old, which is relatively young but not as high risk compared to younger ages.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Black, but race was not a significant factor in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not relevant to recidivism prediction.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone at 18 may lack supervision/support, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college limits opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs, indicating some work experience but possibly unstable employment.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is linked to higher recidivism rates as seen in examples.\"),\n     (\"Upbringing Environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and living with mother may expose to crime but also provide stability.\"),\n     (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence might offer some protective benefits.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
