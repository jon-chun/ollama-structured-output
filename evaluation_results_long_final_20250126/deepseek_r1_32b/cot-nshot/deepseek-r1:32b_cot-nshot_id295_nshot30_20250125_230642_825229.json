    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is a common factor in recidivism studies; typically, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but they might also have higher potential for change. I'll note that age could be a medium risk factor because while he's young, it's not the youngest category.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's quite a high number of prior arrests. From the examples provided earlier, individuals with multiple arrests (like 2 or more) were often predicted to have higher recidivism rates. So, this is a strong indicator; I'd rate this as high risk because multiple convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that might continue.\n\nHe's 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 210 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate directly with recidivism. Unless there's some context about how these factors influence his behavior or opportunities, they probably aren't significant predictors. So, I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living situation can be a factor; being single and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. In some examples, people living with family or in more stable environments had lower recidivism rates. So, this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be mixed; having a GED is better than no diploma, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities. From the examples, some individuals with only high school diplomas or similar had varied outcomes, so I'll consider this a low risk factor since it's not particularly negative.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment history can be tricky; holding a job is generally positive, but only having one in the past year might indicate instability. However, consistent employment was sometimes associated with lower recidivism. Since he does have employment, I'll rate this as low risk because it's a positive sign.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance use is a significant factor. From the examples, drug use often correlated with higher recidivism rates. This person uses both marijuana and cocaine, which are illicit substances, increasing his risk. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area of household size four. Family background can influence outcomes; living with both parents might provide stability, but it's not always the case. Urban environments could mean higher crime exposure, but without more context, I'm inclined to rate this as low risk since having a stable family structure is generally positive.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism. In some examples, individuals with religious involvement had lower rearrest rates. Therefore, this is a low risk factor because it might indicate a support system or values that deter reoffending.\n\nPutting all these together: high prior arrests and convictions, high drug use, medium living alone, others are low or medium. The strongest factors here are the multiple convictions and substance abuse, both high risks. These likely outweigh the lower-risk factors. So, I predict a higher chance of rearrest, but not extremely certain because other factors like employment and family background might mitigate some risk.\n\nI'm about 70% confident in this prediction, considering the balance between strong indicators (multiple arrests, drug use) against protective factors (employment, spiritual beliefs).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, young but not youngest category\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and convictions indicate pattern\"),\n     (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"height and weight not directly correlated with recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"unmarried, living alone may reduce social support\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED but no college enrollment\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"held one job in past year\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"used marijuana and cocaine recently\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"lived with both parents in urban area\"),\n     (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"acknowledges God's role, potential protective factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
