    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one, assign a weight (low, medium, high), explain why, and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 18 years old. In the examples, being younger sometimes correlated with higher recidivism, but it's not always consistent. I'll rate this as low because while youth can be a risk factor, it might be less impactful compared to other factors.\n\nNext, race: White. The examples don't show a strong pattern based on race, so I'll assign low weight here.\n\nConviction history: He has been arrested once and convicted. Past convictions are a significant predictor of future arrests. This should be high because having a prior conviction increases the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nCurrent living situation: Living alone. In some cases, not living with family might increase risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEmployment history: He has held 1 job during the year. Having some employment is positive, so low weight because stable work can reduce recidivism risk.\n\nEducation status: Enrolled in school now. Education is protective against recidivism, so low weight.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a high-risk factor as substance abuse often correlates with higher rearrest rates.\n\nFeeling of depression: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can be a risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this is low.\n\nFamily living situation during upbringing: Lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2. Family structure can influence outcomes; smaller households might have different dynamics, so medium weight.\n\nBelief in God: He doesn't believe God affects his life. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism, so medium weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high and medium factors like prior conviction, drug use, living situation, family background, and belief system might lead me to predict a higher risk. However, protective factors like being enrolled in school and not feeling depressed counterbalance some of this. \n\nI think the prediction is YES for rearrest, with about 75% confidence because there are significant risk factors but also some protective ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is a relatively low-risk factor as they are young and may have more opportunities for rehabilitation.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White does not carry a high risk in the provided examples; race alone is not a significant predictor.\"),\n     (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates a higher likelihood of future arrests based on past behavior.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone can be a medium-risk factor as it may limit social support but doesn't necessarily indicate instability.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests some level of stability, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Education Status\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school indicates ongoing education and potential future opportunities, reducing risk.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Depression Symptoms\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month reduces this risk factor, as mental health issues can contribute to recidivism when present.\"),\n     (\"Family Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of size 2 with his biological mother may influence current behavior but doesn't strongly indicate high risk alone.\"),\n     (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in divine influence might be linked to higher recidivism, though this varies based on other factors.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
