    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18. Looking at the examples, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may engage in more risky behavior. But I'm not sure if being 18 specifically is a high or medium factor.\n\nNext, gender is male. The examples show that males are more likely to be rearrested than females, so this should be a high risk factor.\n\nEthnicity is White. In the examples, most people were either Black or White, and there wasn't a clear trend based on ethnicity alone. So I'll rate this as low since it doesn't seem to have a significant impact in these cases.\n\nArrest history: arrested once but not convicted. The examples show that even one arrest can be a factor, especially if followed by convictions. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe it's medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight (6'0\", 220 lbs) don't seem relevant in the examples provided. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. The example where someone wasn't living alone had a NO outcome, so being single might be a slight factor but not too high. Medium risk perhaps.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. The examples with higher education (like college) sometimes resulted in NO rearrests, while others without it had YES. So maybe medium here.\n\nEmployment: held three jobs during the year. Some examples with multiple jobs still had rearrests, so this might be a low risk factor because having employment is generally positive but not foolproof.\n\nDrug use: none in the past four years. This is good, so low risk.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Positive as well, low risk.\n\nLiving situation: both biological parents and household size 4 in an urban area. The examples show that living with family can sometimes lead to NO rearrests, but it's not always the case. So medium risk here.\n\nReligious belief: believes God influences his life. In some cases, this was associated with lower recidivism. But there were exceptions too, so maybe low impact.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are either low or medium, except for being male which is high. Considering he has a stable background (living with parents, no drugs or depression), the higher risk of being male might be offset by other protective factors. So I think the prediction would lean towards NO rearrest, but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 18 is relatively young, and younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates, but it's not a significant factor alone.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender correlates with higher rearrest rates based on examples.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity does not show a clear trend in the provided examples.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical measurements are not relevant to recidivism in the examples.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate limited social support, but examples vary.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment is a mixed factor.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding multiple jobs indicates some stability, reducing risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is protective.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression suggests good mental health.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents and a stable household size of 4 may reduce risk.\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believing God influences life can be protective, though examples vary.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
