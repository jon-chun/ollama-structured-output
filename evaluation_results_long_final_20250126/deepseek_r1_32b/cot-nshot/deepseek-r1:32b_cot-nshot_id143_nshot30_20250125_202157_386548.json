    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. I'm going to go through each risk factor one by one, assign them a weight (low, medium, high), explain why, and then make a prediction based on all of these.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female. Looking at the examples, most of them are male, but there's at least one example with a female who had \"NO\" outcome. Age might be a factor\u2014being younger could mean higher risk, but she's 22, which isn't extremely young.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. In some examples, being arrested without conviction didn't necessarily lead to rearrest, like in case #19 where the female had \"NO\". So maybe this is a medium factor because it shows some contact with the law but no conviction.\n\nHer weight and height\u20145'7\" and 155 lbs\u2014I don't see how that directly affects recidivism. Maybe low impact.\n\nShe's never been married, which in examples sometimes was associated with higher risk if living alone, but she has a Bachelor's degree, which is positive. So maybe this factor is low because being single isn't the strongest indicator without other negatives.\n\nLiving alone\u2014this could be medium because some studies suggest that social isolation might increase risk, especially combined with other factors like drug use or mental health issues.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree, which is high education. In examples where people had higher education, like in case #29, the outcome was \"NO\". So this should be a strong protective factor\u2014high positive.\n\nShe held four jobs in a year. That could indicate instability or maybe seeking better opportunities. In some cases, multiple jobs didn't lead to rearrest, but others with unstable employment had higher risks. I'll consider it medium because it's somewhat concerning but not the strongest indicator.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and she felt down some of the time last month. Substance abuse is a significant factor. In examples like #27 where drug use was present, the outcome was \"YES\". So this should be high risk.\n\nShe lived with both parents in an urban area as a child. Stable upbringing might be protective. In example #30, similar background but without drugs led to \"NO\", so maybe low risk factor here because it's stable.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her life\u2014spiritual disengagement can sometimes correlate with higher risks if there's no support system. In examples like #27 and #28, lack of religious involvement was present but not always leading to rearrest. I'll rate this as medium because it might indicate less social support.\n\nPutting it all together: the strongest factors are her drug use (high), living alone (medium), multiple jobs (medium). Her education is a strong protective factor (high). The other factors like age, arrest without conviction, and background have lower impacts. \n\nGiven that substance abuse is a major risk, but she's educated and hasn't been convicted before, I'm leaning towards \"NO\" because the protective factors might outweigh the risks, especially if she's seeking help or stable employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22-year-old female, younger age may correlate with higher risk but not extremely young\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest without conviction, shows some legal contact but no conviction\"),\n     (\"weight_height\", \"low\", \"5'7\\\" and 155 lbs, physical attributes don't directly impact recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; higher education may mitigate risk associated with single status\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate social isolation, a potential risk factor\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Completed Bachelor's degree, protective factor against recidivism\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 4 jobs in a year; could suggest instability or job seeking behavior\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance abuse risk\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both biological parents in urban area, protective factor\"),\n     (\"spiritual_views\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role in her life; may indicate lack of social support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
