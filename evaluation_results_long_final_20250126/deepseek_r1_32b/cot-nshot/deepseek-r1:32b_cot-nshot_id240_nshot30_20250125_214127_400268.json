    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step, considering the examples given.\n\nFirst, let's look at age. The individual is 21 years old. In the examples, younger individuals (like 19 or 20) had varying outcomes, but being in their early twenties might not be a significant risk factor on its own. So, I'll rate age as low.\n\nNext, gender is male. Many of the examples with males resulted in recidivism, especially if other factors were present. However, without more specific context, it's moderate but leaning towards low since some cases had \"NO\" outcomes.\n\nEthnicity is Hispanic. The examples didn't specify ethnicity much, so I don't have a strong basis to rate this. It might be low unless there's a known correlation, which isn't evident here.\n\nArrest history: arrested once without conviction. Some examples with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 15. So, this seems low risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 215 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism in the examples provided, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nMarital status: not married. Examples with single individuals had mixed outcomes, but it's a common factor without strong predictive power on its own. So, low.\n\nCurrently living situation: not alone. Some examples where individuals lived with others had \"NO\" recidivism, which might be protective. Thus, medium.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not in college. Examples with similar education sometimes had \"YES\" or \"NO,\" depending on other factors. It's a neutral factor, so low.\n\nEmployment: held 1 job during the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk. So, this is protective; I'll rate it as medium positive.\n\nDrug use: no drugs in past four years. Positive sign, so low risk.\n\nDepression symptoms: none in past month. Mental health issues were sometimes linked to higher risk in examples, but absence here is good. Low.\n\nFamily background: lived with mother in urban area. Family support can be protective. So, medium positive.\n\nBelief in God: considers God influential. Some examples showed this as a protective factor (e.g., Example 15). Medium positive.\n\nNow, considering all factors, most are low or neutral, with some medium positives like living situation, employment, belief in God, and family background. Only arrest history is a mild risk but offset by other factors. Therefore, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old, which is relatively young and not strongly associated with higher recidivism in the examples.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender, but several examples showed males with both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes depending on other factors.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity; examples did not provide specific information about Hispanic individuals, so this factor is neutral.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without a conviction; some examples showed similar circumstances with 'NO' outcomes for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not appear to be significant factors in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; while marital status can sometimes be a factor, it is neutral without additional context.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently not living alone; some examples showed that living with others might have a protective effect against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college; educational attainment did not strongly predict recidivism in the examples.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year; stable employment can be a protective factor against rearrest, as seen in some examples.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years; lack of substance abuse is generally associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"depression_symptoms\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms in the past month; mental health issues were sometimes linked to higher recidivism, but absence here suggests lower risk.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area during childhood; family environment might have a protective effect, as seen in some examples.\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens; religious beliefs were sometimes associated with lower recidivism risk in the examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
