    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for an 18-year-old male based on several risk factors. I'll go through each factor one by one, assign a weight (low, medium, high), and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 18 years old. In the examples given, younger individuals, especially those around 18-20, sometimes had rearrests but not always. I think being young might be a low risk factor because it could indicate that he's still developing and might change his behavior.\n\nNext, race is White. From the examples, both Black and White individuals had rearrests. There wasn't a clear pattern based on race alone, so I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. In previous cases, multiple arrests or convictions were often linked to higher rearrest rates. For example, someone with two prior convictions was predicted to have a YES outcome in one case. So, I should weigh this as high because it shows a history of involvement with the law.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 140 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism. These are physical traits that probably don't influence behavior much, so low impact.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married and lives alone. In some examples, living alone was associated with higher risk because of possible lack of support or structure. But it wasn't a consistent factor, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nEnrollment in school at present is positive. Education can be protective against recidivism. In the examples, being enrolled sometimes led to lower risk predictions. So, this should be low impact but favorable.\n\nNo jobs held during the year could indicate limited stable income or routine, which might be a medium risk factor. Lack of employment can lead to idleness and increased temptation towards crime.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years is significant. Substance abuse is often linked to recidivism because drugs can impair judgment and lead to criminal activity to sustain habits. This should be high impact.\n\nLiving with both biological parents during childhood suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism. So this is low impact but positive.\n\nBelief in God: he considers that God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower risk because they provide moral guidance and support. This should be low impact but favorable.\n\nPutting it all together: the high factors are prior convictions and drug use. Medium is living alone. The rest are low or protective. So, considering these, there's a moderate to high chance of rearrest within 3 years. I'll predict YES with a confidence around 65% because while the history is strong, some protective factors might mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (18)\", \"low\", \"Young age may indicate potential for change and lower risk compared to older individuals.\"),\n     (\"Race (White)\", \"low\", \"Race alone does not show a clear pattern in predicting recidivism from the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"Number of prior arrests (2 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Conviction history (convicted)\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions, especially multiple ones, increase the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Height (5'9\\\")\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height are not directly related to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Weight (140 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Weight is not a relevant factor in predicting rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"Marital status (never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate less social support but wasn't consistently linked to higher risk in examples.\"),\n     (\"Education (enrolled in school)\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment suggests potential for positive change and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Employment status (no jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable employment may contribute to idleness and increased temptation towards criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Recent substance abuse is a significant factor linked to higher rates of recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to continued illegal activities.\"),\n     (\"Living situation during upbringing (both biological parents in urban area)\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents may provide protective factors against recidivism, though this varies by individual circumstances.\"),\n     (\"Belief in God (considers God has something to do with his life)\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer moral guidance and support, which might lower the risk of rearrest.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
