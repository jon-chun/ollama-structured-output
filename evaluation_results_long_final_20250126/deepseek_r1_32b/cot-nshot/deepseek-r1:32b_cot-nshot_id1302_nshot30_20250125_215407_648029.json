    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided earlier.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Looking at the examples, age seems relevant. Younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but since he's 22, which isn't extremely young, maybe this is low risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. In previous examples, multiple arrests often led to a \"YES\" outcome, so this should be a high-weight factor because having two convictions suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest.\n\nHis weight is between 150-174 lbs; I don't think weight directly affects recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. In some examples, living alone might not be a strong indicator, but it can sometimes suggest isolation or lack of support, which could be medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Education level is a big factor; without education, it's harder to get stable jobs, leading to higher recidivism rates. This should be medium to high risk.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective, but only having two might indicate instability or limited opportunities, so I'll rate this as low because he does have some employment history.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant factor for recidivism, especially if it's ongoing. This should definitely be high risk.\n\nHe reported feeling down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so this is medium risk.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of four as a child. Family background might influence behavior, but without more context, I'll consider this low risk since it's not directly linked to recidivism in examples.\n\nBelieves God has an impact on his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective, so this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple convictions (high), drug use (high), lack of education (medium). These seem like strong indicators for higher recidivism. The other factors are either neutral or have lower impact. So the prediction should lean towards \"YES\" with a high confidence level because several high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old, not extremely young\"),\n     (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"two arrests and convictions suggest pattern\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"weight between 150-174 lbs is neutral\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"living alone may indicate isolation\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"lack of diploma/GED affects opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"two jobs show some stability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"marijuana and cocaine use indicates substance issues\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"feeling down suggests possible mental health concerns\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"growing up with mother is neutral\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"belief in God may offer support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
