    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested once but not convicted. He lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, hasn't attended college, held only one job in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years, isn't currently depressed, grew up with his biological mother in a household of six in a rural area, and believes God plays a role in his life.\n\nFirst, looking at prior arrests. He's been arrested once but not convicted. In previous examples, having an arrest without conviction might carry less weight than a conviction, but it still indicates some involvement with the law. So I'll rate this as medium risk because while it's not a conviction, it shows some legal contact.\n\nNext is education level. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In prior cases, lower education was often linked to higher recidivism. This lack of formal education can limit job opportunities and contribute to cycles that might lead back to crime. So I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held only one job in the past year. From the examples, unstable employment is a risk factor because it can lead to financial stress and limited legitimate income sources. However, having at least some work experience might mitigate this slightly compared to someone who's unemployed. I'll rate this as low-medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, especially if it's ongoing or problematic, is a significant factor. In previous cases, drug use was often associated with higher recidivism rates because of its connection to other illegal activities and dependency issues. This will be medium risk.\n\nMental health isn't an issue here; he hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is positive, so mental health status gets a low weight since it's not contributing to the risk.\n\nHe currently lives alone. Living situation can impact recidivism\u2014living with supportive family might reduce risk, while living alone could increase it due to lack of supervision or support. However, there are examples where living alone didn't necessarily predict rearrest, so I'll rate this as low-medium.\n\nFamily background: He grew up in a household of six with his biological mother in a rural area. Family structure and upbringing can influence behavior. In prior examples, growing up with both parents was protective, but here he's only with the mother. However, having a larger family might offer more support or supervision, which could be positive. This is low risk.\n\nBelief in God: He considers that God has a role in his life. In some cases, strong religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism as they can provide moral guidance and community support. So this factor gets a low weight as protective.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher risks are prior arrest history (medium), education level (medium), drug use (medium). These factors might push towards a higher risk of rearrest. However, his mental health is stable, he has some employment, and he has a supportive family background and religious beliefs, which could mitigate that risk.\n\nConsidering all these, the prediction leans towards NO recidivism within three years with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests some legal contact but not a definitive indicator of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment may limit opportunities, increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding one job in the past year indicates some work experience but could suggest limited stability or opportunity.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use within four years is a risk factor as substance use can correlate with criminal behavior and reduced focus on positive outcomes.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No depression reported in the past month suggests current mental health is stable, which may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate a lack of social support or supervision, which might contribute to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with biological mother in a rural area with a household size of six suggests some family stability, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing God has a role in life may provide moral guidance and support, which could lower recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
