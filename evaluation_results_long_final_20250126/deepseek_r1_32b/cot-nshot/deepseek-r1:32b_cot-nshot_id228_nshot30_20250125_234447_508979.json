    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at age. The person is 18 years old. In the examples provided, younger individuals (like 19 or 20) often had higher rearrest rates. So, being 18 might be a high-risk factor because they're still quite young and may have less maturity.\n\nNext, gender is male. All the examples I saw involved males, so this doesn't add much additional risk beyond what's already considered in other factors. It's more of a neutral point here.\n\nEthnicity is White. From the examples, both Black and White individuals had rearrests, but it wasn't a determining factor. So, ethnicity might be low risk since it didn't seem to correlate strongly with outcomes.\n\nArrest history shows 4 arrests with convictions. That's quite significant. In previous cases, higher arrest counts often led to \"YES\" predictions. For instance, someone with two arrests and convictions had a rearrest, so four times seems high risk.\n\nCurrently living alone might be a medium risk factor. Some examples showed that living alone can lead to higher recidivism because there's less supervision or support. But it's not the most critical factor on its own.\n\nLack of education\u2014no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014is a big red flag. Many cases where individuals didn't have formal education ended up with rearrests, especially when combined with other factors like drug use. This should be a high-risk factor because it limits opportunities and increases the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment history shows holding two jobs. Having some employment might actually be protective, as it provides structure and income. However, since this person has a low education level and is involved in drugs, the effectiveness of having two jobs might be mitigated. I'll rate this as medium risk because while it's positive, other factors could override its benefits.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years\u2014is another high-risk factor. Drug use often correlates with recidivism because substances can impair judgment and lead to further criminal activity. Plus, without proper support or treatment, relapse is likely.\n\nNo history of depression in the past month might be a low risk since mental health issues like depression weren't consistently linked to rearrests. However, it's not a strong protective factor either; some examples with no depression still had rearrests.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of three. This is somewhat neutral. While family support can be positive, living alone now might reduce that support. I'll consider this as low risk since the current living situation (alone) was already considered.\n\nPutting it all together, high-risk factors are age, arrest history, education level, and drug use. Medium risks include living alone and employment. Low risks are gender, ethnicity, mental health, and family background. The combination of multiple high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'm fairly confident but not entirely certain, so a confidence level around 85% seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate higher risk due to potential immaturity and lack of stability.\"),\n     (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender is common in the examples but does not significantly influence recidivism on its own.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity was present in both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes, so it doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Four arrests with convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision but can vary in impact depending on other factors.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having two jobs provides some structure, but effectiveness is mitigated by other high-risk factors.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use correlates with higher recidivism due to potential impaired judgment and continued activity.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month is neutral but not a strong protective factor against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a small household is somewhat protective but less impactful than current factors.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
