    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight: low, medium, or high. \n\nFirst, age is 20 years old. Looking at the examples, younger individuals might be more likely to reoffend, but I'm not sure how strong that correlation is. It's probably a low factor because it's just one aspect.\n\nNext, race is White. In some studies, race can be a predictive factor, but it's often considered ethically sensitive and might have low weight in this context.\n\nSex is male. The examples show males being involved more frequently, which could indicate a higher risk. Maybe medium here since gender can influence recidivism rates.\n\nArrest count is 2 times without conviction. Multiple arrests suggest some propensity towards criminal behavior, even without convictions. That's probably high because repeated interactions with the law are significant.\n\nCurrent living situation is alone. Living alone might not directly correlate but could indicate lack of support, which might be a medium factor.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not in college. Low education levels are often linked to higher recidivism. This should be high as it's a strong predictor.\n\nEmployment: Held 3 jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can reflect instability, so this is probably medium because while it shows some work ethic, inconsistency might be a concern.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a key factor, especially if it's ongoing. That should be high as it's directly related to potential criminal behavior and relapse.\n\nMental health: Feeling down sometimes. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so this is medium because occasional feelings might not be as strong as persistent issues.\n\nResidence with biological mother in a rural area of size 3. Family support could vary; living with family might offer some stability or not enough if the environment isn't supportive. This is low because it's more about the current situation than past factors.\n\nBelief about God: Doesn't think God affects his life. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior, but this is subjective and varies widely. So, low weight.\n\nPutting it all together, high-weight factors are arrest count (2 times without conviction), lack of education, drug use, and mental health issues. The medium factors include sex, employment instability, and living alone. Low factors like age, race, residence, and spiritual beliefs have less impact.\n\nConsidering the examples, when someone has multiple arrests, no convictions, low education, drug use, and some mental health struggles, they often ended up with a \"YES\" for recidivism. So, I'm leaning towards predicting \"YES\" with high confidence because several strong factors point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age of 20 is relatively young and may not strongly correlate with rearrest alone\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race may have some correlation but is less directly predictive\"),\n     (\"sex\", \"medium\", \"Male gender correlates moderately with recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"arrest_count\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate higher propensity for reoffending\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might suggest lack of support systems\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may reflect instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can be linked to criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down sometimes indicates potential mental health issues\"),\n     (\"residence_with_mother\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a small household may not directly predict rearrest\"),\n     (\"spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"Beliefs about God's influence may have less direct impact on recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
