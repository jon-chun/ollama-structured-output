    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. Looking at the examples, age seems relevant because younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates. But since they're 20, which isn't too young, maybe it's medium risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. In the examples, race doesn't seem to be a significant factor in predicting rearrest, so I'll mark this as low impact.\n\nArrested twice but not convicted yet. The arrest history is important because prior arrests can indicate a pattern. But since there are no convictions, it's moderate\u2014maybe medium weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 180 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly relate to recidivism in the examples I saw, so low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can be a factor; living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase risk. So medium weight here.\n\nHas a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important because higher education can reduce recidivism. Not being in college might be a red flag, so medium impact.\n\nHeld only one job this year. Employment stability matters; inconsistent work could lead to legal issues. Since he's only had one job, that's a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and not depressed recently. Both of these are positive signs. Substance abuse is a big recidivism factor, so no drugs would be low impact. Not feeling depressed also helps, but mental health can still play a role, so maybe low to medium.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Family stability might reduce risk. Growing up with both parents is positive, so low impact on recidivism.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, but it's not always clear, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium or low. The prior arrests and lack of higher education stand out the most. But without convictions and positive aspects like no drug use, maybe the risk isn't too high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is a moderate age for rearrest risk as it's not extremely young but still in early adulthood where recidivism can occur\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals do not typically have higher rearrest rates based on the examples provided\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate some potential for recidivism, though no convictions reduce this risk\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight are not significant predictors of rearrest\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can be a risk factor as it may indicate less social support\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college may limit opportunities, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job might suggest unstable employment, which is linked to higher rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years significantly reduces this risk factor\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers the risk associated with mental health issues\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable environment is protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence can provide positive support but doesn't guarantee lower rearrest rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
