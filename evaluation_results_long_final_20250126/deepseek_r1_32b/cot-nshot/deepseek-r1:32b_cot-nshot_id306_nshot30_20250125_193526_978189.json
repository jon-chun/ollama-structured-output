    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age: she's 19 years old. In the examples, younger individuals sometimes had higher rearrest rates, but it's not a clear-cut indicator. So I'll rate this as low weight since age alone isn't a strong predictor.\n\nEthnicity is White. The examples don't show a significant pattern with ethnicity affecting recidivism, so another low weight here.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, having an arrest without conviction might be less impactful than a conviction. So I'll mark this as medium because it shows some involvement with the law but no conviction yet.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism based on the previous data, so low weight for those factors.\n\nShe's single and living alone. In some examples, living alone could be a risk factor if there's less supervision or support. I'll give this a medium weight as it might indicate potential vulnerability.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is positive. Education often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so high weight here because it's protective against rearrest.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can be a protective factor, but holding only one job might not be as strong as having multiple or stable employment. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so high weight here. Substance abuse often relates to higher rearrest rates.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this is protective. High weight because mental health stability is positive.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of five as a child. Stable family background might lower recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium because it's a protective factor but not the strongest on its own.\n\nBelieves God doesn't influence her life. In some examples, lack of religious involvement was associated with higher rearrest rates. So high weight here as it's a notable risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: she has several protective factors like being enrolled in school and having no depression, but also significant risks from drug use and lack of belief in God. The positive factors might help mitigate some risks, so the prediction leans towards NO rearrest with moderate confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is a factor but not strongly predictive without additional context.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity does not show a clear pattern in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but lacks the impact of a conviction.\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not relevant to recidivism prediction.\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not relevant to recidivism prediction.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate potential vulnerability without family support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n     (\"education_attainment\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school suggests engagement with education, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job indicates some work experience but not as strong as multiple or stable employment.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for rearrest and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"high\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month suggests good mental health, which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household can be protective against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"high\", \"Believing God has no influence on her life may indicate lack of religious involvement, which was associated with higher rearrest rates in some examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
