    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let's look at each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 years old. In the examples, younger age might increase risk because they have less life experience and are more likely to engage in risky behavior. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNext, he's male. The data shows that males have higher rearrest rates than females, so male gender is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I don't see specific examples about ethnicity, but some studies suggest minorities might face more scrutiny. I'll give it a low weight since the examples don't highlight this directly.\n\nArrested 6 times and convicted. This is a strong indicator of recidivism because multiple arrests show a pattern of offending. That's high risk.\n\nHeight is 5'0\", which seems short, but there's no data linking height to rearrest. Low weight here.\n\nWeight between 150-174 lbs is average; not relevant. So low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Unstable living situation can be a risk factor. Medium because it shows some instability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education limits opportunities, increasing recidivism risk. High.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment is linked to higher crime rates, so this is high risk.\n\nUsed marijuana in past four years. Drug use can lead to more offending, but it's a softer drug compared to others. Medium weight.\n\nNot felt depressed last month. Mental health issues are a factor when present, but here he isn't depressed. So low risk.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 6 in urban area. Large families might have less supervision, so medium risk.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Some studies show religious belief can reduce recidivism. Low or medium? I'll say medium because it's protective but may not be strong enough against other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: high from multiple arrests and convictions, high from lack of education and unemployment. Other medium factors like age, living situation, drug use, family environment. Protective factor is belief in God.\n\nThe weight of the high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. So prediction is YES with confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age can increase risk due to potential for continued criminal behavior and less life experience\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"high\", \"Males have been shown to have higher rearrest rates in the examples provided\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (Hispanic)\", \"low\", \"No specific examples highlight ethnicity as a significant factor\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests (6 times) and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n     (\"Height (5 feet 0 inches)\", \"low\", \"Height is not directly related to rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"Weight (150-174 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Weight is not a significant factor in predicting rearrest\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never married) and Living Situation (Not living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living situation can impact stability, which may influence recidivism\"),\n     (\"Education (No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of rearrest\"),\n     (\"Employment Status (No jobs during the year)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is linked to higher rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in past four years)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can indicate potential for continued criminal activity\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (Not felt depressed over past month)\", \"low\", \"Absence of depression may reduce risk, but other factors may still influence recidivism\"),\n     (\"Family Background (Lived with biological mother in a household of 6 in urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger family might indicate potential supervision challenges\"),\n     (\"Belief in God (Considers God influences his life)\", \"low\", \"Belief in religion may have a protective effect against recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
