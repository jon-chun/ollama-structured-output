    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the provided examples.\n\nFirst, age is 18 years old. In previous cases, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, have sometimes shown higher recidivism rates. For example, a 19-year-old female had a 'NO' outcome but was still young. So I'll rate age as low since the person is just starting out, but it's still a factor.\n\nNext, race is White. In examples, both Black and White individuals have shown varied outcomes, with some rearrests regardless of race. There doesn't seem to be a strong correlation here, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nArrest history: arrested once, not convicted. Some cases where arrest without conviction still led to recidivism, like the 19-year-old female who was arrested but not convicted and had 'NO'. So maybe this is medium because it's a minor offense but no conviction could indicate less likelihood of repeat offense.\n\nMarital status: married, living with spouse. This seems protective. Most examples without clear protective factors had higher recidivism. Being married might lower the risk, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nEducation: lacks high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. In previous cases, lack of education was a medium factor. It can limit opportunities and increase chances of reoffending, so medium here too.\n\nEmployment: held 2 jobs during the year. Stable employment is protective. Cases with multiple jobs might indicate responsibility, so this is low risk.\n\nDrug use: no drug use in past four years. That's positive. In examples, those without drug issues had lower recidivism, so low.\n\nDepression symptoms: none in the past month. Mental health is important; absence reduces risk. Low factor here.\n\nLiving situation: lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 in rural area as a child. The living environment during upbringing can affect behavior. Rural areas might have different crime rates, but without more context, it's medium. However, since he's now married and living with spouse, maybe this is less relevant. I'll rate it low.\n\nBelief in God: considers that God has something to do with his life. In some examples, belief was protective. So low risk here.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: most are low or medium. The arrest without conviction is a medium factor, but the protective factors like being married, employed, no drugs or depression seem strong. So overall, the prediction leans towards 'NO' with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 18 is relatively young, and while younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates, this individual has not shown signs of reoffending yet.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race as a factor does not show a strong correlation with rearrest in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction could indicate potential risk, but no prior convictions might suggest lower likelihood of repeat offense.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs during the year indicates some level of stability and responsibility.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"depression_symptoms\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month reduces the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n     (\"living_situation_childhood\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a stable household with biological mother in a rural area may have provided a positive environment during upbringing.\"),\n     (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might contribute to personal accountability and lower recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
