    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, let's look at age. The person is 20 years old. In previous examples, younger individuals, especially in their late teens or early twenties, sometimes had higher recidivism rates. However, being 20 might not be as high a risk compared to someone much younger. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, gender is female. From the examples, females seem less likely to reoffend compared to males. So gender gets a low weight.\n\nRace is White. The examples include both White and Black individuals with various outcomes. It doesn't seem like race was a strong predictor in those cases, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: She's been arrested twice and convicted. In the examples, having multiple arrests increased the likelihood of recidivism. So two arrests would be medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 4'11\" and 130 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem related to recidivism in the examples, so low.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married but is not living alone. The examples didn't show a strong connection between marital status and recidivism, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nEducation: She has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Not having higher education might be a medium risk factor because lack of further education could limit opportunities.\n\nEmployment: She's held two jobs. In the examples, having more job stability was sometimes linked to lower recidivism, so holding two jobs seems positive. I'll rate this as low.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor; it often increases the chance of rearrest. So medium risk here.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed recently. In some examples, mental health issues correlated with higher recidivism. Since she's not currently depressed, this is low.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of five. Stable family backgrounds usually lower recidivism risk, so medium positive factor.\n\nSpirituality: She believes God influences her life. In examples where individuals were spiritual, there was sometimes a lower chance of rearrest. So low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: The main factors pushing towards recidivism are prior arrests (medium), drug use (medium). Factors against are gender, education, employment, mental health, family background, and spirituality. Since the negatives are more significant but not overwhelming, I'll predict a NO for rearrest with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old, which is relatively young but not as high risk as younger individuals in some examples\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender, which has shown lower recidivism rates in previous cases\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race, no strong correlation with recidivism in the provided examples\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"2 prior arrests and convictions, indicating some history of criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"4 feet 11 inches is not a risk factor for rearrest\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"130 lbs is within normal range and not indicative of recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, but not living alone; marital status didn't strongly correlate in examples\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate only, lack of higher education may limit opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs, which suggests some stability and responsibility\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Did not feel depressed in the past month, mental health stable compared to examples\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in urban area; stable family background may reduce risk\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences her life, which in some cases correlated with lower recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
