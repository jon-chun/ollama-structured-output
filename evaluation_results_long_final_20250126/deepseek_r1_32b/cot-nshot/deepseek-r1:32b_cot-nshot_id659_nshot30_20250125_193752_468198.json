    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this case and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight of low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, age is 21 years old. In the examples, younger individuals (like 19-22) have had varying outcomes. Some rearrested, some didn't. So I'll rate this as medium because it's common for recidivism but not a strong indicator alone.\n\nSex is female. Looking at the examples, most cases are male, so there's less data on females. But since she has multiple arrests, gender might be low risk compared to other factors.\n\nRace is White. In the examples, both White and Black individuals had rearrests, so race doesn't seem to be a strong factor here. I'll mark it as low.\n\nShe's been arrested 9 times with convictions. High number of prior arrests strongly suggests higher recidivism risk. This should definitely be high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'3\" and 105 lbs don't directly relate to recidivism, so low impact.\n\nMarital status: Never married. In the examples, marital status varied; some were married, others weren't. Not a strong predictor here, so low.\n\nCurrently not living alone. This might indicate support or supervision, which could be protective. So maybe medium since it's somewhat positive but not a guarantee.\n\nEducation: High school diploma. She has one, but isn't in college. Education level varies in examples; some with diplomas rearrested, others didn't. Medium impact.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job during the year. Inconsistent employment might be a risk factor, so medium.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in past four years. Drug involvement is a significant factor for recidivism. High weight here.\n\nDepression status: Not felt depressed. Mental health issues can be a factor, but since she's not depressed, this might lower the risk. Medium.\n\nLiving situation as a child: Lived with mother in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence outcomes, so medium.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God irrelevant. In some examples, lack of religious involvement was linked to higher recidivism, so high weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weights are prior arrests (9 times), drug use, and religious beliefs. These point towards a higher risk. The protective factors like not living alone might slightly lower the confidence but overall, the prediction leans towards rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a typical range for recidivism but not a strong indicator alone.\"),\n     (\"Sex\", \"low\", \"Female gender may have varying effects on recidivism, especially with high prior arrests.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White race does not significantly correlate with rearrest based on examples.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"9 prior arrests and convictions strongly indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly influence recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married has mixed correlation in examples but is not a primary factor here.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may offer some support, which could be protective but isn't strong enough to offset other risks.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment is neutral but doesn't strongly predict recidivism either way.\"),\n     (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job might indicate limited stable employment, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana) is a significant indicator of potential continued criminal behavior and substance-related offenses.\"),\n     (\"Depression Status\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression may reduce some mental health-related risks but does not address other factors like substance abuse.\"),\n     (\"Childhood Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with mother in an urban area could reflect family dynamics that might influence outcomes, though this varies widely.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Believing God has no impact on her life may correlate with a lack of moral or spiritual deterrents against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
