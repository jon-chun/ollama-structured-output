    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 20 years old. In the examples, people in their early 20s had varying outcomes. Some had YES and others NO. So maybe age alone isn't a strong indicator.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That seems significant because having a prior conviction is often linked to higher recidivism rates. I'll rate this as high risk.\n\nEthnicity: He identifies as Black. In the examples, being Black didn't always lead to a YES outcome, but it's worth noting that systemic factors might play a role. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\" and 180 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem to correlate directly with recidivism in the given examples, so low risk here.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and is living alone. The example where someone lived alone had a NO outcome, but I'm not sure if this is a strong factor. Maybe medium.\n\nEnrollment in school: He's currently enrolled. Education can be protective against recidivism, so that's a positive sign. Low risk here.\n\nNumber of jobs: He held 5 jobs in the past year. That seems high and could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. High risk as job instability is linked to higher recidivism.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if ongoing, can increase recidivism chances. Medium risk since it's not clear how frequent or severe the use is.\n\nMental health: He felt down some of the time recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if untreated, so medium risk.\n\nUpbringing: Lived with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area. The examples didn't show a strong link between upbringing and outcome here, so low risk.\n\nBelief in God: He believes God influences his life. In some cases, this belief was associated with lower recidivism. Medium positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Most of the factors are medium or high. Prior conviction is high, job instability is high. The protective factors like school enrollment and belief in God might mitigate some risk but probably not enough to overcome the other factors. So I'm leaning towards a YES prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (20)\", \"low\", \"Young age is generally associated with lower recidivism, though early 20s can vary.\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested and convicted increases the likelihood of rearrest due to established criminal history.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity (Black)\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a systemic factor, it's not determinative in recidivism risk alone.\"),\n     (\"Height (6'1\\\") and Weight (180 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes have no direct correlation with recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never Married, Living Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate less social support, but not always a strong predictor.\"),\n     (\"School Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school is protective against recidivism as it provides structure and opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Number of Jobs (5 in the Past Year)\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana in Past Four Years)\", \"medium\", \"History of drug use is a risk factor, though the impact varies based on frequency and context.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (Feeling Down Some Time Past Month)\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles can contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n     (\"Upbringing (Lived with Biological Mother in Urban Area)\", \"low\", \"Growing up with biological mother may provide some stability, though urban upbringing can have varied impacts.\"),\n     (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"medium\", \"Belief in a higher power can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism when it provides purpose and support.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
