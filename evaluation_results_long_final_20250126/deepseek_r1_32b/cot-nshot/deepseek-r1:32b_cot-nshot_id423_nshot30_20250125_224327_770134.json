    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22 years old. Looking at examples, younger ages might be higher risk since they have more time and possibly less stability. But some examples with similar ages had both outcomes. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nNext, race is White. From the examples, I don't see a strong pattern indicating higher or lower risk based on race alone. So probably low impact.\n\nArrest history: 2 arrests with convictions. That seems significant because past behavior can predict future actions. Examples like case #7 had similar arrest counts and rearrested. High weight here.\n\nMarital status is single, living alone. Some examples showed that living alone might increase risk due to less support. But not all cases with this factor rearrested. Medium impact.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Low education often correlates with higher recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment history: Held 2 jobs in the year. Having some work experience might be positive, but holding multiple jobs could indicate instability. Examples vary; maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism. High impact here.\n\nMental health: Some depression symptoms last month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. Medium weight as it's present but not extreme.\n\nChildhood living situation: Lived with biological father in a 4-person household. No clear pattern from examples, so low impact.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God influences life. Some studies suggest this might lower risk, though examples aren't consistent. Low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are arrest history and drug use, plus education. Medium are living alone, employment, mental health. The positives like religious beliefs are minimal. So overall, higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger age may indicate higher risk due to potential for continued criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race not shown as a strong predictor in the examples\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"2 arrests with convictions; past behavior is a strong indicator of future recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone; lack of social support can increase risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college; low education correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year; inconsistent employment may indicate instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down some of the time last month; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological father in a 4-person household; no clear pattern from examples\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens; religious affiliation may have some protective effect but not strongly indicated\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
