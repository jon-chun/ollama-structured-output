    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one, assign a weight (low, medium, high), and then explain why. \n\nFirst, age is 22 years old. Looking at the examples, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing. But in some cases, being 19-30 doesn't necessarily mean higher risk. I'll say low weight here.\n\nRace is White. In the examples, race isn't a dominant factor unless it's part of other contexts like living situation or education. So I'll assign low weight to this as well.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested 6 times and convicted. That's significant because more prior arrests correlate with higher recidivism. This should be high weight.\n\nConviction status is yes. Since he's convicted, that's a stronger indicator than just being arrested. High weight here too.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'7\" and 154 lbs. These don't seem relevant to recidivism, so low weight.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Some studies show that being unmarried can be a risk factor, but it's not the strongest. Medium weight.\n\nLiving alone. In some cases, living alone might indicate less support or supervision, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism because of limited opportunities. High weight here.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs during the year. Some employment might suggest some stability, but only two jobs might indicate instability or inability to maintain consistent work. Medium weight.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor as it can lead to continued criminal behavior. High weight.\n\nDepression symptoms: He felt down some of the time. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so medium weight.\n\nLiving situation as a child: Lived with biological mother in an urban area. Family structure might influence outcomes, but without more context, I'll give it low weight.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God influential. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can reduce recidivism, so this is a positive factor. Low weight.\n\nPutting all together, the high-weight factors are arrest history, conviction, lack of education, and drug use. Medium weights include marital status, living alone, employment, and depression. The rest are low. Given the multiple high-risk factors, especially prior convictions and drug use, it's likely he'll rearrest. So prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22 years old, which is relatively young but not necessarily a strong indicator of recidivism alone.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White, as race alone does not strongly predict recidivism in the provided examples.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"6 prior arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Conviction Status\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted increases the likelihood of rearrest due to potential ongoing criminal activity or systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"5'7\\\" and 154 lbs do not correlate with recidivism in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; lack of marital ties can sometimes be associated with higher risk, though it's not a dominant factor here.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate limited social support, which could contribute to recidivism risks.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; lower education levels are often linked with higher recidivism rates due to reduced opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year; some employment may suggest a degree of stability, but limited job history could indicate instability.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years; substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"Depression Symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down some of the time, which can impact decision-making and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"Living Situation as a Child\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area; family structure during upbringing may have long-term effects but is not a dominant factor here.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence; some studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism, though this is context-dependent.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
