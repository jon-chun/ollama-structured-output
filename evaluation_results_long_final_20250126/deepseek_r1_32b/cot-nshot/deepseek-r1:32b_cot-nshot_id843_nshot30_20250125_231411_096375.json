    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 19 years old. In previous examples, younger individuals like 19 or 20 were more likely to have a \"NO\" prediction. So I'll mark age as low risk.\n\nNext, race is White. From the examples, both Black and White individuals had mixed outcomes, so race alone isn't a strong factor here. That's a medium weight.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. High number of arrests strongly correlates with higher recidivism risk. This should be a high-weighted factor.\n\nHeight and weight are within average range (5'10\", 150-174 lbs). The examples didn't show any significant impact from physical attributes, so this is low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate less social support, which might increase risk slightly. So medium weight here.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Those with diplomas had varied outcomes. Maybe not the strongest factor, so medium.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs during the year. Stable employment usually lowers risk. This is low weight.\n\nDrug use includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Drug involvement is a significant predictor of recidivism, especially harder drugs like cocaine. High weight here.\n\nMental health: He felt down some time in the past month. Emotional issues can contribute to recidivism but aren't as strong alone. Medium weight.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a larger household (size 6). Stable family upbringing might lower risk, so low weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God has nothing to do with his life. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes be linked to higher risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. Medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together, the high-weight factors are multiple arrests/convictions and drug use. The medium factors include living alone, mental health issues, and lack of religious involvement. Low factors are age, race, education, employment, family background.\n\nConsidering these, especially the high number of arrests and drug use, I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction for rearrest recidivism. My confidence is around 85% because while there are some protective factors like education and family background, the strong predictors outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which aligns with examples where younger individuals have lower recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Race alone does not strongly predict recidivism based on the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"arrest_count\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested 8 times and convicted significantly increases rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight do not correlate with recidivism in examples.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone may indicate less social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment shows mixed outcomes in examples.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs indicates some stability, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong predictor of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down sometimes may contribute to recidivism but isn't the strongest factor alone.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable environment lowers risk.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement can slightly increase risk, though not as strongly.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
