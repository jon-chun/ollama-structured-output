    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assign weights to each risk factor for predicting rearrest recidivism. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a strong predictor, so maybe low weight.\n\nHe's White. In some cases, race can influence outcomes, but it's not the most significant factor here, so medium weight.\n\nConviction history: he was arrested once and convicted. This is usually a strong indicator for recidivism, so high weight.\n\nHeight and weight (5'10\", 165 lbs) are physical attributes that don't typically correlate with recidivism, so low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can be relevant\u2014living alone might indicate less supervision, but it's not as strong a factor as others, so medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important; having a diploma is positive but not pursuing higher education could be a risk, medium weight.\n\nHeld three jobs in the past year. Employment stability can be protective, so low weight since he has consistent work.\n\nNo drug use in four years. Substance abuse is a major factor, and no recent use suggests lower risk, high weight.\n\nNot felt depressed recently. Mental health issues are linked to recidivism, so not feeling depressed is positive, medium weight.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of four in a rural area as a child. Family environment can influence behavior; stable upbringing might be protective, low weight.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk, medium weight.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high weights are on conviction history and no drug use. The other factors are mostly medium or low. Since he has a conviction but no drugs or depression, and some protective factors like employment and belief in God, I'd predict NO rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age of 22 is not highly predictive on its own for recidivism\"),\n     (\"race_white\", \"medium\", \"Race can have systemic influences but not the strongest factor here\"),\n     (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Having a conviction history increases risk significantly\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are less relevant to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status_single\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate lower supervision\"),\n     (\"education_high_school_diploma\", \"medium\", \"Education level is moderate; not pursuing higher education could be a risk\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"low\", \"Consistent employment may reduce recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse_none_recent\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use significantly lowers risk\"),\n     (\"mental_health_not_depressed\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed is protective but not the strongest factor\"),\n     (\"childhood_home_environment\", \"low\", \"Growing up with biological mother in a stable household is somewhat protective\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may provide support and reduce recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
