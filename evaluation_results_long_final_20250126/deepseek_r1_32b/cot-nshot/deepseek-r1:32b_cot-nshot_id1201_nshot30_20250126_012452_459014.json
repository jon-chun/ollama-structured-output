    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. In the examples, higher arrest counts without conviction might not always lead to a \"YES\" outcome. For example, in case #2, someone with three arrests and no convictions was predicted as \"NO.\" So maybe this is a medium risk factor because while multiple arrests are concerning, the lack of convictions could indicate other factors at play.\n\nShe's 19 years old, which seems relatively young. In some examples, younger individuals had lower recidivism rates, like case #29 who was 19 and predicted \"NO.\" So age might be a low risk factor here.\n\nHer race is Black. Looking back, several cases with Black individuals were predicted as \"YES,\" such as case #30. This could indicate that racial factors play a role, so I'll mark this as high.\n\nShe hasn't been married, but in the examples, marital status didn't seem to be a major factor. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's not living alone, which might provide some support or supervision, possibly lowering the recidivism risk. From case #28, living with others was associated with \"NO,\" so this is a medium factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment often correlates with lower recidivism, so lacking it could be a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year, which suggests she has some work experience. In case #30, holding multiple jobs didn't prevent a \"NO\" outcome, but having stable employment can sometimes reduce recidivism. So I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) is present, which is a significant factor. Many cases with drug use were predicted \"YES,\" so this is high risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of three. Family support can be protective, but the urban environment might have more opportunities for criminal activity. I'll consider this medium risk.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe God influences her life. In some examples, lack of religious belief was associated with higher recidivism, so this is high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (medium), age (low), race (high), marital status (low), living situation (medium), education (high), employment (low), drug use (high), upbringing (medium), religion (high). \n\nMost factors point towards higher risk, especially the high-weighted ones like race, education, drug use, and religious belief. So I'm leaning towards predicting \"YES\" with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age: 19\", \"low\", \"Young age may indicate lower likelihood of recidivism compared to older individuals\"),\n     (\"Race: Black\", \"high\", \"Historical data shows higher rearrest rates for Black individuals\"),\n     (\"Number of arrests: 3 (no convictions)\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests but no convictions suggest potential risk, but lack of conviction may indicate less severe charges or outcomes\"),\n     (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between marital status and recidivism in provided examples\"),\n     (\"Living situation: Not living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living with others may provide support but could also limit supervision depending on the environment\"),\n     (\"Education level: No high school diploma/GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n     (\"Employment: Held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"low\", \"Stable employment may reduce recidivism risk, though multiple jobs could indicate instability\"),\n     (\"Drug use: Marijuana and cocaine in past four years\", \"high\", \"Illicit drug use is a significant predictor of rearrest\"),\n     (\"Upbringing: Lived with biological mother in urban area (household size 3)\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may present environmental risks, but living with family could provide support\"),\n     (\"Religious belief: Considers God has nothing to do with her life\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may correlate with higher recidivism rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
