    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander. In the examples, race wasn't explicitly mentioned in terms of weighting, but generally, I might consider that being Asian/Pacific Islander could be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to Black or Hispanic individuals. However, since there's no specific data here, maybe this factor has a low weight.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, prior arrests without conviction sometimes led to 'NO' outcomes, like in Example 19 where a White female with one arrest and no conviction didn't rearrest. So, this might be a medium risk factor because it shows some criminal history but not a conviction.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 160 lbs. Height and weight don't seem to correlate directly in the examples, so I'll rate this as low impact.\n\nLiving alone at age 22 is somewhat common, but in Example 30, living alone with other factors led to 'NO'. So, maybe it's a medium factor since being alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is often protective against recidivism. In Examples like 19, higher education was associated with lower risk. This should be a high protective factor.\n\nNo jobs held during the year might be concerning. In Example 30, holding multiple jobs didn't prevent rearrest, but not having any could indicate instability or lack of structure, so this is medium risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) can be a risk factor. In Examples like 27 and 30, drug use was present but didn't always lead to rearrest. However, it's still a medium concern since substance use can correlate with recidivism.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive. Mental health issues were mentioned in some examples leading to 'YES' outcomes, so lack of depression here might be protective, making this low risk.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable upbringing often reduces recidivism risk. This seems like a high protective factor.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. In several examples, religious beliefs were associated with 'NO' outcomes, so this is a high protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: education, living situation, and religious belief are strong protective factors (high weight), while prior arrest and drug use are medium risks. The lack of employment adds another medium risk. Considering the protective factors outweigh the risks, I predict a lower chance of rearrest with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is 22, which is relatively young but not in the highest risk bracket for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander may have lower rearrest rates compared to other groups based on general trends.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some criminal history, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not correlate strongly with recidivism in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support, which may be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Enrollment in a 4-year college is protective against rearrest, as seen in several examples where higher education correlates with lower recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year might indicate instability or lack of structure, which can be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is present but does not necessarily correlate directly to rearrest in all examples, though it remains a concern.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported in the past month suggests better mental health, which is protective against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban area as a child indicates a stable upbringing, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Believing God has a role in his life may provide additional support and reduce the likelihood of rearrest, similar to examples where religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
