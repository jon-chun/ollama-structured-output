    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 21-year-old White female based on her risk factors. The user provided some examples which I should use as references.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old.\n2. Race: White.\n3. Sex: Female.\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction.\n5. Weight and height: 5'4\", 139 lbs (probably not relevant but included for context).\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone.\n7. Education: GED certificate, not enrolled in college.\n8. Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n9. Drug use: Marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n10. Mental health: Felt extremely down all of the time last month.\n11. Living situation as a child: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area.\n12. Belief in God's influence: Considers that God has something to do with her life.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nAge: In the examples, age didn't seem to be a significant factor unless it was particularly young. Since she's 21, which is relatively common, maybe low impact.\n\nRace: The examples had both White and Black individuals with recidivism outcomes varying. Maybe race isn't a strong predictor here, so low.\n\nSex: Being female might have some correlation since females are generally less likely to reoffend, but it's not always clear-cut. Maybe medium.\n\nArrest history: She has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, having an arrest without conviction sometimes led to recidivism (e.g., Example 1). So this could be a medium factor since it shows some risk.\n\nMarital status and living alone: Unmarried and living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. Medium weight.\n\nEducation: She has a GED but isn't in college. In the examples, education level sometimes correlated with recidivism. Not having higher education might be medium risk.\n\nEmployment: Holding 2 jobs is positive. Stable employment usually lowers recidivism risk. So this would be low or even protective, maybe low.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine use is a significant factor. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so high weight here.\n\nMental health: Feeling extremely down all the time suggests depression or anxiety, which can increase recidivism risk. High weight as mental health issues are serious.\n\nChildhood living situation: Lived with both parents in an urban area. This seems stable and protective, maybe low impact.\n\nBelief in God: She believes God influences her life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism (e.g., Example 1). So medium or low.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Drug use is a high factor because substance abuse increases risk.\n- Mental health issues are also high as persistent depression can lead to reoffending.\n- Arrest history is medium since there's a prior arrest, even without conviction.\n- The rest of the factors have lower weights but still contribute somewhat.\n\nLooking at examples where drug use and mental health were present: Example 7 had both drugs and mental health issues, leading to a \"YES\" prediction. Similarly, other cases with these factors also trended towards higher risk.\n\nSo considering her high-risk factors in drugs and mental health, along with an arrest history, I think the prediction would be \"YES\" for rearrest within three years. The confidence is high because substance abuse and mental health are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old, a common age which doesn't strongly indicate recidivism\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White, race not shown as significant predictor in examples\"),\n     (\"Sex\", \"medium\", \"Female, generally lower risk but context matters\"),\n     (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest without conviction suggests some risk\"),\n     (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may reduce social support\"),\n     (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"GED but not in college, potential for limited opportunities\"),\n     (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs, stable employment lowers risk\"),\n     (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana and cocaine use significantly increases risk\"),\n     (\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Persistent depression indicates high risk for recidivism\"),\n     (\"Childhood living situation\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is protective\"),\n     (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Belief may provide support but not a strong factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
