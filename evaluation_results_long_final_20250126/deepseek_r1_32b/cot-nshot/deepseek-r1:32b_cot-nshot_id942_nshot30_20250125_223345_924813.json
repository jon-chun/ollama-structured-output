    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let me start by looking at all the risk factors provided and assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to each based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. In the examples, age doesn't seem to be a significant factor unless it's very young, like 19 or under. So I'll mark age as low risk.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From the examples, race isn't highlighted as a major factor in predicting recidivism, so that's also low risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. In some cases, prior arrests without convictions might be considered less impactful compared to convictions. However, having an arrest record could still indicate potential issues, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 155 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant to recidivism based on the examples, so low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone might not be directly linked unless it implies social isolation, but in the examples, this factor isn't emphasized much, so I'll rate it as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes be a factor, but having a diploma is generally positive. Since he's not in college, maybe that's neutral or slightly negative if education is seen as protective. However, the examples don't show much on this, so I'll go with medium.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment is usually a protective factor against recidivism. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of rearrest, so this should be low risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially harder drugs like cocaine, is a strong indicator for potential criminal behavior. This seems like a high-risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Family stability is protective, so this should be low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, though it's not always consistent across cases. Still, I'll mark this as low risk since it might contribute positively.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the most significant one is the recent drug use, which is high risk. However, several other factors like prior arrest (medium), education (medium), and living alone (low) also play a role. The protective factors include family stability, belief in God, employment, and education.\n\nIn the examples, cases with drug use often resulted in \"YES\" for rearrest, but some had additional high-risk factors. This case has one high-risk factor (drug use) and a few medium or low ones. So I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" because of the protective factors balancing out the risks, though there's still uncertainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 20 is not particularly young, so lower risk factor\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is not a significant predictor in provided examples\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction indicates moderate concern\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes unrelated to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married and living alone, but no strong correlation shown\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is protective, not enrolled in college neutral\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding jobs suggests stability, positive factor\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer some protection\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
