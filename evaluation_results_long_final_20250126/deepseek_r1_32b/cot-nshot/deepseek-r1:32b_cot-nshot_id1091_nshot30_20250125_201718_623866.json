    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let's go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Looking at the examples, age seems to be a factor, but it's not heavily weighted unless combined with other factors. So I'll give this a low weight.\n\nHe identifies as Black. In some cases, race was mentioned, but without more data on its direct impact here, I think this is low as well.\n\nHe has been arrested 7 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior arrests, which in the examples often correlated with higher recidivism. So this should be high weight.\n\nHis height and weight (5'11\", 150-174 lbs) don't seem relevant to recidivism, so low.\n\nNever married, living alone. In some cases, not being married or living alone was a medium factor, indicating less social support, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is often a key factor; lack of it can increase recidivism risk, so this is high.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Employment status is critical; without work, there's less structure and possibly more involvement in criminal activities, making this high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism, especially if ongoing or frequent, so medium to high weight here.\n\nFeeling down some of the time. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but without more details on severity, I'll rate this as low.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area as a child. Family background is sometimes a factor, but unless there's more context, it's low.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior, and in examples where someone had no belief, recidivism was higher, so medium weight here.\n\nPutting this all together: high prior arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and spiritual disconnection are strong indicators for recidivism. The prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 22 is within a typical range but not strongly predictive alone.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race as a factor isn't directly addressed in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and convictions indicate a high likelihood of recidivism based on prior behavior patterns observed in examples where multiple arrests were present and associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk in the given examples.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_residency\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may indicate less social support, which can be a medium risk factor as seen in some cases where living arrangements contributed to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment is a significant risk factor, as education level often correlates with recidivism rates in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year suggests unemployment, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism as seen in cases where lack of stable employment was present and associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana) is a moderate risk factor, as substance use can contribute to recidivism but may vary depending on other factors such as treatment access or social support.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_indicators\", \"low\", \"Feeling down some of the time indicates possible mental health issues, which can be a risk factor but without more specific information, it's considered low in this context.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area as a child is not directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided, though family dynamics can play a role and may be worth considering further.\"),\n     (\"spiritual Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with his life may indicate a lack of spiritual support, which could contribute to higher risk as seen in some examples where spiritual disconnection was associated with recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
