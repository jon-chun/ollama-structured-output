    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Looking at the examples, age seems to be around 19-21 years old in most cases. The examples don't specifically highlight age as a major factor unless it's significantly younger or older, so I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. In the examples, race doesn't seem to be a predominant factor, though some outcomes vary regardless of race. So, I'll also mark this as low risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. From the examples, being arrested once with a conviction might not always lead to rearrest. For example, in Example 29, someone arrested once but not convicted had a NO outcome. Here, he's convicted, which could be more serious. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are given as 6 feet 0 inches and 240 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem to correlate with recidivism in the examples, so low risk here.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently not living alone. In Example 30, someone living alone had a NO outcome, but here he's not living alone, which might indicate more stability. I'll consider this as medium risk because being single could still be a factor, but not living alone adds some stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education seems positive; for example, Example 29 had someone with similar education and a NO outcome. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Employment can be a protective factor. In Example 30, holding multiple jobs didn't prevent a NO outcome, but it might show some stability. I'll rate this as medium risk because consistent work could help reduce recidivism.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana. Drug use is a significant factor. Many examples with drug use, especially when combined with other factors like unemployment or living alone, had YES outcomes. So, this is high risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 at a young age. A stable family environment is protective. Examples like 29 and 30 show that coming from a stable home can lead to NO outcomes. This is low risk.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has nothing to do with his life. In Example 27, someone who felt this way had a YES outcome. Religious involvement or belief sometimes is seen as protective, so lacking it might increase risk. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the highest risk factors are drug use (high) and conviction history (medium). Protective factors include education, family background, and not living alone. The presence of a conviction and drug use leans towards higher risk, but the positive factors like education might mitigate that somewhat. I'm predicting a YES outcome with medium confidence because while there are several protective elements, the combination of past conviction and substance use suggests a moderate likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which falls within the typical age range in examples without specific emphasis on recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not show a consistent correlation with recidivism outcomes in provided examples.\"),\n     (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted suggests some criminal history, though it's not the highest factor in previous examples.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not indicators of recidivism risk as per the examples.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and currently not living alone indicates possible instability or lack of support, though it's a moderate factor.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests positive educational engagement, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs may indicate job stability but could also suggest instability if jobs are short-term; context unclear from data provided.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a significant risk factor, as seen in examples where drug use correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household size of four suggests a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has no role in life may indicate lower social support, which can be a risk factor as seen in some examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
