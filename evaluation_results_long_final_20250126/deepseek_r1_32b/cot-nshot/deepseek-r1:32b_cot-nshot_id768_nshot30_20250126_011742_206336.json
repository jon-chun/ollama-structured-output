    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me start by looking at each risk factor individually and assigning a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a major factor unless it's very young or older. Since she's in her early twenties, I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic. The examples don't specify ethnicity as a significant factor, so I'll also mark this as low.\n\nShe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. That's a high number of arrests compared to the other cases where higher arrest counts often led to \"YES\" outcomes. So, this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5 feet 4 inches and 180 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant in the examples, so I'll rate them as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. From some examples, living alone might be a medium risk because it could indicate less social support.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education-wise, having a diploma is better than not, so this is low risk.\n\nShe held 3 jobs during the year. Employment can be positive, so I'll consider this as low.\n\nDrug use includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant factor, so this is high risk.\n\nShe sometimes felt down in the past month. Mental health issues are important; feeling down could indicate distress, so medium risk.\n\nLived in a household of size 6 during youth. Family environment might have some impact, but without more context, I'll mark it as low.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective, so this is low risk.\n\nLooking at the examples, higher arrests and drug use often led to \"YES.\" Her four arrests and substance use are strong indicators. However, factors like education, employment, and spiritual belief might slightly mitigate that. But considering the weight of multiple convictions and drug issues, I'll predict a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is not particularly young or old, so low risk\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity not indicated as significant in examples\"),\n     (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and convictions indicate high recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not relevant to recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a positive factor\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having 3 jobs suggests some stability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance issues\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Sometimes feeling down may indicate stress\"),\n     (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Upbringing in a larger household not necessarily predictive\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might offer some support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
