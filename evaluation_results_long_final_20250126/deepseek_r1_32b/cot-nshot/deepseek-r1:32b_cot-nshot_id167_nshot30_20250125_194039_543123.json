    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 21-year-old White male based on his risk factors. The examples given show various cases with different outcomes\u2014either YES or NO for rearrest.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight: low, medium, or high. Then, using these weights, I'll make a prediction.\n\n1. **Age**: He's 21. Looking at the examples, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. For example, someone aged 19 was predicted NO, while others in their early 20s had mixed outcomes. But age alone isn't the strongest factor here; it might be low or medium.\n\n2. **Race**: White. In previous cases, both Black and White individuals had rearrests. So race doesn't seem to be a dominant factor. Probably low weight.\n\n3. **Number of Arrests**: He's been arrested once and convicted. The examples show that one arrest can lead to either YES or NO. However, being convicted might carry more weight since it indicates a past conviction. This could be medium or high.\n\n4. **Conviction History**: Yes, he has a conviction. In some cases with convictions, the outcome was YES. This is likely a high-weight factor because having a prior conviction can increase recidivism risk.\n\n5. **Height and Weight**: 6 feet 1 inch and 155 lbs. These don't seem relevant to rearrest rates in the examples provided. So low weight.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone. In some cases, living alone was associated with higher risks, but others were not. It's probably medium since it can impact social stability.\n\n7. **Education Level**: He has a GED and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. This should be a high-weight factor because educational attainment often reduces the likelihood of rearrest.\n\n8. **Employment Status**: No jobs held during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it might lead to more criminal activity or lack of structure. Medium weight since it's not always directly correlated but can contribute.\n\n9. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if ongoing, is a significant risk factor. However, he hasn't used recently or maybe it's occasional. This could be medium to high depending on context.\n\n10. **Depression Symptoms**: No depression reported over the past month. Lack of mental health issues can be protective. Medium weight since mental health plays a role but isn't always decisive here.\n\n11. **Family Background**: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 3. Family stability might influence outcomes, but it's not as strong a factor as others. Low to medium weight.\n\n12. **Religious Belief**: Considers God irrelevant. In some examples, lack of religious involvement was linked to higher recidivism. This could be medium or high since spiritual engagement sometimes correlates with lower crime rates.\n\nPutting this all together: High-weight factors are conviction history and education level (opposite effects). Medium factors include living alone, no jobs, drug use, and religious belief. Age is a bit ambiguous but leans towards low to medium. \n\nThe positive factor here is his education\u2014being in college might significantly lower his risk despite other factors like unemployment or past convictions. The conviction history is a red flag, but if he's pursuing higher education, it suggests he's trying to make changes.\n\nSo, considering the protective factor of education and enrollment in college versus the risks of a conviction and no current job, I think the overall prediction leans towards NO rearrest. Confidence isn't super high because there are conflicting factors, so maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old, which is within a higher-risk demographic for recidivism but not the highest\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White, race does not strongly correlate with rearrest in provided examples\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history\"),\n     (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Prior conviction is a strong indicator for recidivism\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Not relevant to rearrest prediction\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to higher risk\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college suggests positive behavior change and lower risk\"),\n     (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year could indicate lack of stable income\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use but not recent\"),\n     (\"Depression Symptoms\", \"medium\", \"No depression reported, which is protective\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background with biological mother\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Irrelevant view of God might contribute to higher risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
