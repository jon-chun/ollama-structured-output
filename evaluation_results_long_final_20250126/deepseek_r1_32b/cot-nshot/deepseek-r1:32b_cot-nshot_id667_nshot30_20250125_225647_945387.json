    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at age: she's 20 years old. In the examples, younger individuals (like 19-21) have varied outcomes. Being 20 is in the middle range; I'll consider it low risk because older adults are less likely to recidivate compared to younger ones, but not extremely so.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. The examples don't show a strong correlation with recidivism based on gender alone. So, I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nEthnicity is White. Again, the examples don't indicate ethnicity as a significant factor in recidivism prediction, so it's low.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. In some cases, having a prior conviction increases the risk. For example, in case #27, prior convictions led to a \"YES\" outcome. So this is a medium risk factor because one conviction isn't as strong as multiple but still notable.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'1\" and 110 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant in the examples provided, so they're low risk.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and not living alone. The example where someone wasn't living alone had a \"NO\" outcome (case #28). So this is low risk.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education typically lowers recidivism risk, so this is a strong protective factor\u2014low risk.\n\nEmployment: She's held three jobs in the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, but holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or other issues. I'll consider this medium risk because while it shows some work effort, frequent job changes could be a concern.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant factor; in several examples (like #27, #30), drug use was linked to higher recidivism. This should be high risk.\n\nMental health: She's felt down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but it's not as severe as more persistent depression. So medium risk here.\n\nLiving situation: Lived with both parents in an urban area. Stable family living might offer support and lower recidivism risk, so low risk.\n\nReligious belief: She doesn't think God influences her life. In some examples (like #27), a lack of religious involvement was associated with higher risk. So medium risk here.\n\nNow, compiling the weights: most factors are low or medium, but drug use is high and mental health and religious belief are mediums. The prior conviction and substance abuse are significant predictors. On balance, considering these factors, I think the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism, with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; older adults are less likely to recidivate\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender alone does not significantly correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity shows no significant correlation in examples provided\"),\n     (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One prior conviction indicates some risk, though not as strong as multiple convictions\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not relevant to recidivism prediction\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married and not living alone; examples show mixed outcomes but leaning low risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are protective factors\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs may indicate instability, which could be a concern\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time indicates potential mental health issues that can contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area suggests stable support, lowering risk\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's influence may indicate lower social support and higher risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
