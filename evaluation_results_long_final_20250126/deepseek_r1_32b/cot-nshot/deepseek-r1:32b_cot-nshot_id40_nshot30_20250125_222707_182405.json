    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this case of a 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Looking at the previous examples, younger ages like 19-20 often had \"NO\" outcomes, but being 21 might be a bit older and could pose higher risk. But in some cases, even at 21, if other factors were low, it was still \"NO\". So maybe medium weight here.\n\nNext, ethnicity: Hispanic. The examples didn't specify much about ethnicity, so I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe low impact compared to other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested 3 times and convicted. That seems like a strong indicator of higher risk. In the examples, those with multiple arrests often had \"YES\" outcomes, so high weight here.\n\nHeight and weight (5'11\", 175-199 lbs) don't seem relevant in previous cases; probably low impact.\n\nMarital status: separated and living alone. The example where someone was living alone but had other factors like drug use still resulted in \"NO\". So maybe medium, as living alone can indicate some instability.\n\nEducation: no diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. This is a significant factor. In examples, lack of education correlated with higher risk, so high weight.\n\nEmployment: held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator; in previous cases, this often led to \"YES\" outcomes, so definitely high.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a major factor. In examples, drug use was a key point for predicting recidivism, so high weight here too.\n\nMental health: felt down some of the time. While depression can be a factor, it's not as severe as others. Maybe medium impact.\n\nLiving situation in urban area with foster or other parents. The example where someone lived in an urban area but had other issues sometimes resulted in \"NO\". So probably low weight here.\n\nBelief about God: considers that God has nothing to do with his life. In examples, this was a factor; lack of spiritual support can contribute, so medium impact.\n\nPutting it all together: the high-weight factors are multiple arrests, no education, unemployment, and drug use. These point towards higher risk. The other factors like age, marital status, mental health, living situation, and belief add moderate or low weight. So overall, I'd predict a \"YES\" outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 21 is within the typical range for recidivism but slightly older which might indicate stabilization efforts\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not significantly impact recidivism without additional context\"),\n     (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of offending behavior\"),\n     (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are generally unrelated to recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone post-separation may indicate potential instability or lack of support systems\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase risk factors for reoffending\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No employment during the year suggests limited legitimate income sources, increasing reliance on criminal activities\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates substance abuse issues which are strongly correlated with recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health_indicators\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time may indicate potential mental health struggles that could contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"living_situation_details\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area and having been raised by non-biological parents may not directly correlate with recidivism without additional context\"),\n     (\"spiritual_or Religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has nothing to do with his life could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be linked to higher risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
