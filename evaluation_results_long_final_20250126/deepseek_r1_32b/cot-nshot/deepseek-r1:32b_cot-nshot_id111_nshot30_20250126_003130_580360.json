    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the prediction for this case. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, let's look at age: 19 years old. In previous examples, younger ages like 19 or early 20s didn't seem to have a strong correlation with recidivism on their own. So I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nNext is gender: female. Looking back, females in the past examples had outcomes that were mixed but leaning towards lower rearrest rates compared to males. So I'll consider gender as low risk here.\n\nEthnicity is Hispanic. The examples didn't specify much about ethnicity, so I can\u2019t assign a clear weight based on that alone. Low risk for now.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: 5 times and convicted. This seems significant because having multiple convictions is a strong indicator. In the examples, higher arrest counts often led to \"YES\" predictions. So this should be high risk.\n\nMarital status: married and living with spouse. From past cases, being married and not living alone was associated with lower recidivism. For instance, Example 28 had a person not living alone and the outcome was \"NO\". So marital status is low risk.\n\nEducation level: no diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism. In Example 7, someone without a diploma had a \"YES\" prediction. This should be medium risk.\n\nEmployment: held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of rearrest. Examples like 1 and 28 showed that having jobs helped lower the risk, while unemployment was present in some \"YES\" cases. So this is high risk.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Clean drug history seems positive. In Example 30, someone who didn't use drugs had a \"NO\". Low risk here.\n\nMental health: felt down some of the time in the past month. This could be a moderate factor since it's not severe depression but still a concern. Medium risk.\n\nLiving situation at young age: lived with both parents in an urban area. Stable upbringing might lower risk, as seen in Example 30 where family stability was present and outcome was \"NO\". Low risk.\n\nBelief in God: considers that God has something to do with her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective factors. In Example 28, this factor was present and the outcome was \"NO\". So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several high-risk factors (prior arrests, no job) and some medium (lack of education, mental health). The positive aspects include being married, stable upbringing, and not using drugs. I think the high-risk factors might outweigh the positives, but given that she's married and has a stable background, maybe the risk is moderate. However, considering her multiple convictions and unemployment, it leans towards higher likelihood. So prediction would be \"YES\" with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old; younger individuals may have lower rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"female gender associated with lower rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity not strongly correlated with recidivism in examples\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 prior arrests and convictions indicate high risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"married, living with spouse may reduce risk\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"lack of diploma or GED is a moderate risk factor\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"unemployed for the past year increases recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years is protective\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"occasional feelings of depression are a concern\"),\n     (\"living_situation_childhood\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing with both parents may lower risk\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"belief in God could provide protective factors\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
