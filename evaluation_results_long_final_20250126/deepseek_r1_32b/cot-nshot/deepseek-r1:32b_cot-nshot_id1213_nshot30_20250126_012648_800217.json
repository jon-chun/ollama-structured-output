    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 19-year-old Black female based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one, assign them a weight (low, medium, high), and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, age is a factor. She's 19 years old. Looking at the examples, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and integrating into society. But since she's on the lower end of young adulthood, maybe this isn't the highest risk. So I'll mark age as low.\n\nRace is Black. In some studies, race can be a factor due to systemic issues, but it's not a direct cause. The examples don't show a clear pattern tied to race, so I'll consider it medium.\n\nArrest history: She has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions. So this is low.\n\nWeight and height (5'6\", 190 lbs) don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll mark these as low.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if it means lack of support, but she's enrolled in college, which suggests some stability. So medium here.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college. Education usually reduces recidivism risk. This should be low.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. Having a job is positive, so low risk.\n\nDrug use: None in the past four years. This is a strong protective factor, so low.\n\nDepression symptoms: She hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase risk, but her current state is good, so low.\n\nLiving situation: At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 5. Stable family background is positive, so low.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes God influences her life, which can provide support and reduce recidivism risk. Low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, most are low or medium. The arrest without conviction is the main concern, but education, employment, no drug use, and stable background weigh more positively. So the prediction should be NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old, on the lower end of young adulthood\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic challenges\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Not related to recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Not related to recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living alone but in a stable situation\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years\"),\n     (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Stable family background\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences her life\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
