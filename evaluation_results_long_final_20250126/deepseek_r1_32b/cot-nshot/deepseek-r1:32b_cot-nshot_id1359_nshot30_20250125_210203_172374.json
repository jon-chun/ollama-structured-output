    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age: The person is 19 years old. In the examples provided, younger individuals (like 19) didn't necessarily correlate with a higher risk of rearrest. For instance, example #29 had a 19-year-old female who was not rearrested. So maybe age isn't a strong indicator here.\n\nNext, race: He identifies as Black. There's a known disparity in the criminal justice system affecting Black individuals more frequently. In the examples, some Black individuals did recidivate (like example #27) while others didn't (example #30). It might be a medium factor because of systemic issues but not the sole determinant.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested twice and convicted. That's significant. Looking at examples, those with more arrests or convictions had higher rearrest rates. For instance, example #27 had two arrests and was rearrested. So this should be a high risk factor.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone. In the examples, some who lived alone recidivated (like #27) while others didn't (example #30). It might not be as strong on its own but could contribute to medium risk.\n\nEmployment status: He hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a factor; in example #28, unemployment was present and the outcome was NO. But without job stability, it's a moderate concern.\n\nEducation: He is enrolled in school now. Education can be protective. Example #30 had someone enrolled but still rearrested. However, being in school might offer some support, so maybe low risk here.\n\nSubstance use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor. In example #27, drug use was present and led to rearrest. So this should be high.\n\nMental health: No depression reported. That's positive; examples with mental health issues had mixed outcomes but not necessarily higher recidivism. So low impact here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in an urban area. Family stability can vary, but without more info, it's hard to say. Maybe medium because living with a parent might offer some support or not, depending on other factors.\n\nSpirituality: Believes God influences his life. Spiritual involvement can sometimes reduce recidivism. Example #27 had this and was rearrested, but others didn't. It might be low risk in this context.\n\nPutting it all together: The high factors are arrest history and substance use. Medium includes race and family background. Low factors include age, education, mental health, and spirituality. Employment is medium because of lack thereof.\n\nConsidering the weights, the higher risks (arrests, drugs) likely outweigh the others. So I'd predict a YES for rearrest with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The person is 19 years old, which is relatively young and not strongly indicative of recidivism on its own.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black may contribute to systemic factors but isn't the sole determinant in this context.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate a higher likelihood of rearrest based on previous examples.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be a factor, though it's not as impactful without additional context.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held this year suggests potential instability, which could influence recidivism.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school may offer protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a significant risk factor for rearrest based on examples provided.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, indicating no current mental health crisis contributing to risk.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in urban area; family stability can vary but may offer support or not.\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide some protective factors against recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
