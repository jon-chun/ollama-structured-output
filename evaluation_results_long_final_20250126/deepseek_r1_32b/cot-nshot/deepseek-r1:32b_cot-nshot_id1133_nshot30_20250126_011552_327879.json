    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the age: he's 18 years old. In the examples provided, most individuals were in their late teens or early twenties. Younger offenders might have a higher likelihood of rearrest because they're still developing and may not have stable circumstances yet. However, it's just one factor among many.\n\nNext, gender is male. The examples show that males are more likely to be rearrested compared to females, as seen in cases like example #30 where the male had a high number of arrests but didn't predict recidivism immediately. But I need to consider other factors too.\n\nRace identified as Black: In many studies and data sets, Black individuals often face higher arrest rates and systemic issues that might contribute to recidivism. The examples show several Black males with rearrests, so this could be a significant factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 17 times and convicted. That's a high number of arrests, more than the other cases I've seen in the examples. For instance, example #1 had 3 prior arrests but didn't rearrest, while others had fewer. High arrest counts often correlate with higher recidivism rates because they might indicate chronic offending or systemic over-policing.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'3\" and 155 lbs. I don't recall these being significant in the examples. They might not influence recidivism much, so this is a low factor.\n\nLiving alone as an 18-year-old without being married could be a medium risk. Stable living situations can reduce recidivism, but being alone might mean less support or supervision, which could lead to higher risks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college: Education level is often linked with employment opportunities. Without education, it's harder to find stable jobs, leading to potential involvement in crime for economic reasons. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only 1 job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk because consistent work reduces time available for criminal activities and provides income. One job might indicate job instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially harder substances like cocaine, can impair judgment and lead to more criminal behavior to sustain drug habits. This is a high-risk factor because substance abuse is strongly linked with recidivism.\n\nHe's felt down all the time in the past month. Persistent depression or mental health issues can increase stress, making it harder to maintain relationships, jobs, and positive behaviors. Mental health struggles are a medium risk, as seen when individuals struggle emotionally but may not always rearrest without other factors.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 5. Growing up in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or limited opportunities, which could contribute to recidivism. However, family support can sometimes mitigate this, so it's medium risk.\n\nBelieves God doesn't influence his life: Lack of religious involvement might remove a source of moral guidance and community support that some find helpful in staying out of trouble. This is a low to medium factor, as seen in examples where individuals without such beliefs sometimes rearrest more often.\n\nPutting it all together: He has high arrest counts, active drug use, mental health issues, no education, limited employment, living alone, and systemic factors like race and urban upbringing. These are significant red flags indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; younger age may correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"male gender is common but not the sole factor\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals face systemic issues affecting recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"17 arrests and convictions indicate chronic offending\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes unlikely to influence recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"living alone may reduce support systems\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"lack of diploma affects employment opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"only one job indicates potential instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"use of marijuana and cocaine links to criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"persistent depression can impair judgment and behavior\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"urban upbringing may expose to crime influences\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"lack of belief might reduce community support\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
