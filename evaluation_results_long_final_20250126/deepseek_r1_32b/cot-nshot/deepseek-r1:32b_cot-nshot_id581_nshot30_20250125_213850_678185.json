    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, let's look at age. The person is 22 years old. In previous examples, younger individuals like 19 or 20 had a mix of outcomes, but older ones sometimes had 'YES' predictions. Maybe being 22 isn't as high-risk as someone in their early 20s.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. Looking at the examples, females generally have lower rearrest rates. There was one example where a female had a 'NO' outcome, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nEthnicity is White. In some cases, being White didn't correlate strongly with recidivism, but it's not a high-risk category either.\n\nArrest history: she has been arrested once but not convicted. Previous examples showed that even one arrest without conviction could sometimes lead to rearrest, like in example #30 where the outcome was 'NO'. So this might be medium risk because an arrest indicates some involvement but no conviction yet.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'3\" and between 150-174 lbs. These are average stats; I don't see how they directly impact recidivism, so low risk.\n\nMarital status: not married and not living alone. Cohabiting might offer some support, which could lower recidivism risk. So this is a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nEducation: GED but not enrolled in college. A GED is better than no diploma, but not as strong as a high school diploma. In example #30, lack of diploma was medium risk. Maybe similar here.\n\nEmployment: held 4 jobs in the past year. High job turnover can indicate instability, which might be a medium risk factor since it's associated with higher recidivism.\n\nDrug use: no drugs in the past four years. That's positive; substance abuse is often linked to recidivism. So this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nMental health: some depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated. Since she has felt down, that might be medium risk.\n\nLiving situation: lived with mom in an urban area as a child. Stable upbringing could be protective, but living with family now isn't specified. Maybe medium because it's not clear how stable her current environment is.\n\nReligious belief: believes God influences her life. This can provide support and lower recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors, the majority are low or protective. The medium risks are arrest history, employment instability, mental health, and living situation. But the protective factors might outweigh them. I think the prediction leans towards 'NO' with moderate confidence because while there are some red flags, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"Age is within a range that shows mixed outcomes, but not strongly indicative of high risk.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males in the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"No strong correlation with recidivism based on ethnicity in the examples.\"),\n     (\"Arrest history (1 arrest, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction may indicate some risk but not as high as multiple convictions.\"),\n     (\"Height and weight (5'3\\\", 150-174 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not directly correlate with recidivism in the examples.\"),\n     (\"Marital status (Not married, not living alone)\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide some support, reducing risk.\"),\n     (\"Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)\", \"medium\", \"A GED is a positive factor, but lack of current enrollment may indicate limited opportunities.\"),\n     (\"Employment (4 jobs in the past year)\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes can indicate instability and higher recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"Drug use (No drug use in the past four years)\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Mental health (Some depression in the past month)\", \"medium\", \"Depression may increase recidivism risk if untreated or unmanaged.\"),\n     (\"Living situation (Lived with biological mother in an urban area as a child)\", \"medium\", \"Stable upbringing but current living arrangements are not specified, which could impact risk.\"),\n     (\"Religious belief (Believes God has influence in her life)\", \"low\", \"Strong religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
