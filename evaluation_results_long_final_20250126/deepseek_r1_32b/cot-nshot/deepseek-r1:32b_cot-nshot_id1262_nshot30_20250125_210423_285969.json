    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once but not convicted. He's living alone, has a high school diploma, held two jobs in the past year, hasn't used drugs in four years, isn't depressed, lived with his dad in an urban area as a child, and doesn't believe God influences his life.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each risk factor one by one. Age 21 is relatively young, but not extremely so for recidivism. Some studies show that younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but it's not the strongest predictor here. So maybe low weight.\n\nEthnicity as Hispanic: From the examples, race sometimes plays a role, but without more data on Hispanic outcomes specifically, I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nArrested once but no conviction suggests he hasn't been formally charged or found guilty, which might lower recidivism risk. That's probably low weight because it's less severe than a conviction.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so those are low.\n\nLiving alone could be both positive and negative. It might mean more independence but also possible isolation. I'll rate this as medium since it can affect social support.\n\nHigh school diploma is positive; education often correlates with lower recidivism. That's a strong protective factor, so high weight against recidivism.\n\nHolding two jobs shows stability and responsibility, which is a good sign. This should be a high protective factor, so low risk for recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in four years indicates good behavior and self-control. This is a strong positive, so high weight against recidivism.\n\nNot feeling depressed suggests mental health stability, another positive factor. High weight.\n\nLiving with biological dad as a child might indicate a stable upbringing, which is protective. Medium weight because family dynamics can vary widely.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life: In the examples, people who don't believe in God sometimes had higher recidivism rates. So this could be medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are protective except for ethnicity and belief in God. However, the positive factors like education, employment, no drugs, and mental health seem to outweigh the negatives. The low number of arrests, no convictions, stable living situation, and strong personal choices point towards a lower likelihood of rearrest. So I'd predict NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not an extreme age for recidivism\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may have some correlation in the data, though it's not a strong predictor without more context\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Only arrested once with no conviction, which suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is unlikely to be a significant factor in recidivism prediction\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not typically a relevant factor for predicting rearrest\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate less social support, which may correlate with higher risk, but it's not definitive\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective against recidivism as education is often associated with lower rates\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs suggests stability and responsibility, which are strong protective factors\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates good behavior and self-control, significantly lowering risk\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month points to mental health stability, a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n     (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological dad as a child may indicate a stable upbringing but family dynamics can vary widely\"),\n     (\"religion_views\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has nothing to do with his life might be associated with higher risk based on some examples where lack of religious involvement correlated with recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
