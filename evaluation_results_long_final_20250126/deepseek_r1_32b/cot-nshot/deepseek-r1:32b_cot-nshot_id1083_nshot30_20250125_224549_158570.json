    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21 years old. In the examples, most individuals are around their early twenties, and being younger might increase the likelihood of rearrest because they're still developing socially and economically. So I'll mark this as medium weight since it's a common factor but not the strongest indicator alone.\n\nNext, race: Black. The examples show that some Black individuals have rearrested, but it's mixed. Since race can be a sensitive factor, I won't give it too high a weight unless other factors support it. So low weight here.\n\nNumber of arrests is two times with convictions. In the examples, higher arrest counts often led to \"YES.\" This seems like a significant indicator, so high weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and between 200-224 lbs. I don't see any correlation in the examples regarding physical size, so low weight for this factor.\n\nMarital status is single, living alone. Some examples show that not living alone can be protective, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So medium weight here.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates because of limited opportunities. High weight for this factor.\n\nEmployment status: Held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the risk of rearrest due to financial stress and lack of positive activities. This should be a high weight.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a strong predictor, especially if it's ongoing or problematic. High weight here.\n\nMental health: No depression in the past month. In examples where individuals were not depressed, outcomes varied. However, absence of current depression might indicate better mental state, so low weight.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 11. Large households can sometimes mean more supervision or chaos; it's unclear from the examples. Medium weight here.\n\nBelief in God: Considers that God has influence. In some cases, this belief correlated with lower recidivism, but it's not consistent across all examples. So medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: The high weights are number of arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These are strong indicators pointing towards a higher risk. Medium factors include age, living alone, household size, and belief in God. Low factors are race, physical size, mental health.\n\nConsidering the examples, individuals with multiple convictions, no job, and substance use often had \"YES\" outcomes. This case has several high-risk factors, so I'm leaning towards predicting a \"YES\" for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is within the typical range for recidivism risk but not the highest factor on its own.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race may influence outcomes but is not a primary factor in this analysis.\"),\n     (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests with convictions indicate a higher likelihood of rearrest based on examples.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No correlation observed between physical size and recidivism in the examples.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes increase risk, though not always conclusive.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor due to limited opportunities.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases financial stress and risk factors for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance use, especially marijuana, can lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month may indicate better mental state but isn't a strong predictor alone.\"),\n     (\"household_size_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Large household size at young age could have mixed effects on supervision and environment.\"),\n     (\"religion_spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God might offer some protective factors, though inconsistent across examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
