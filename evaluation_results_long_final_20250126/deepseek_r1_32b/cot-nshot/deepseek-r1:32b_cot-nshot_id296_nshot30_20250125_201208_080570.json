    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual based on their risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. From the examples, age doesn't seem to be a major factor, but it might have some low impact since younger individuals might still be developing their behavior patterns.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. In the examples, having multiple arrests and convictions often led to \"YES\" outcomes. So this is probably a high-risk factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism.\n\nHis weight is between 150-174 lbs, which doesn't seem relevant on its own, so I'll assign low weight here.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. In some examples, living alone was associated with higher risk, but it wasn't a consistent factor. So maybe medium impact since not having support could increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this is significant because education level often correlates with recidivism. Many \"YES\" cases had individuals without these qualifications, so this should be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can help reduce recidivism, but holding multiple jobs might indicate instability. This could have a medium impact as it's somewhat positive but not strongly protective.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) is another high-risk factor. Substance abuse is often linked to higher rearrest rates, so this gets a high weight.\n\nHe felt down some of the time in the past month, indicating possible mental health issues. This could lead to medium risk since poor mental health might contribute to recidivism but isn't always a direct cause.\n\nLived with biological dad in an urban area with a household size of 3. Family background and environment can have some influence, so this is low impact as the examples didn't emphasize this much.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life\u2014religion can sometimes be protective against recidivism. This might lower risk slightly, so low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include living alone, job instability, and mental health. Low factors are age, weight, family background, and religion. The high-risk factors likely outweigh the others, leading me to predict a \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 21 is not a strong indicator of recidivism based on examples\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and convictions indicate a higher risk for rearrest\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight range does not significantly impact recidivism\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be associated with higher risk factors\"),\n     (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs may indicate instability but not necessarily recidivism\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) strongly correlates with higher risk of rearrest\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time suggests possible mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological dad in an urban area is not a strong indicator on its own\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role may have a slight protective effect but is not a major factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
