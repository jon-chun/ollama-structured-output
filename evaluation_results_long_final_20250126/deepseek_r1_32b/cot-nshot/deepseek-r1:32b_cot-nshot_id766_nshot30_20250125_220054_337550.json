    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 22-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals (like 19-20) sometimes have higher recidivism rates, but being 22 might mean she's slightly more mature. I'll rate this as low risk since she's not a minor anymore and might be settling into adulthood.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear marker of past criminal behavior. In the examples, having a conviction history usually leads to higher recidivism. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 155 lbs. I don't see how these physical attributes directly relate to rearrest risk in the provided examples. Maybe if someone is larger, they might be more likely to commit certain crimes, but here it's average. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. That's a strong protective factor. Stable relationships often reduce recidivism because of social support and accountability. Definitely a low-risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education-wise, having a diploma is better than not, but without further education or job training, she might face challenges. However, her two jobs this year show some stability. This is medium risk because it's neither very good nor bad.\n\nShe held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be protective, as it provides income and routine. But having only two jobs isn't as strong as having more or stable employment. So I'll rate this as low since she has work experience but maybe not full-time or long-term.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a significant risk factor. Even if it's just marijuana, it could indicate potential for other behaviors or legal issues. This is high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health stability is good. In examples, depression was sometimes linked to higher recidivism. So this is low risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area as a child. Family environment can influence behavior. Growing up in a stable family might be protective, but living in a rural area isn't directly linked to rearrest rates in the examples. I'll rate this as medium since it's somewhat positive but not a strong factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism. This is low risk because it's a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high risks from past conviction and drug use, medium from family background and education, and several low risks like age, marriage, employment. The positives might outweigh the negatives here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"Adult age, slightly mature, lower risk compared to younger individuals.\"),\n     (\"Conviction history (1 arrest, convicted)\", \"high\", \"Past conviction indicates higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n     (\"Height and weight (5'3\\\", 155 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not directly linked to rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"Marital status (married, living with spouse)\", \"low\", \"Stable relationship is protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"Education (high school diploma, not in college)\", \"medium\", \"Basic education but no further education may present challenges\"),\n     (\"Employment (held 2 jobs in the past year)\", \"low\", \"Work experience shows some stability\"),\n     (\"Drug use (marijuana in past four years)\", \"high\", \"Substance use indicates potential legal issues or behavior patterns\"),\n     (\"Depression status (no depression in past month)\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability is protective\"),\n     (\"Family background (lived with biological mother, household size 5, rural area)\", \"medium\", \"Stable family environment but location not a strong factor\"),\n     (\"Religious beliefs (God influences life)\", \"low\", \"Beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
