    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. Let's break down each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 19 years old. In the examples, being younger didn't always lead to a 'YES' outcome. Some younger individuals had 'NO', so maybe age isn't a strong indicator here. I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, race is White. The examples show both White and Black individuals with 'YES' or 'NO' outcomes. It doesn't seem like race is a significant factor on its own. So, low weight.\n\nThe person has been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, having one conviction could be medium because it's not too high but still indicates some criminal history.\n\nWeight is between 225-249 lbs. This doesn't seem to correlate with recidivism in the examples; most cases didn\u2019t mention weight as a factor. So, low.\n\nNever married and living alone: Examples showed that living alone can be a risk factor. Some 'YES' outcomes were for people living alone, so this might be medium.\n\nEnrolled in school now is positive. In some examples, being enrolled was linked to lower recidivism. This could be a protective factor, so low weight as a negative indicator.\n\nHeld 3 jobs: Having multiple jobs can indicate instability or seeking better opportunities. Some examples with more job changes had 'YES', so medium risk.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years: Drug use is often linked to higher recidivism. Many 'YES' outcomes involved drug use, so this is high.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area as a child: Stable upbringing might lower risk. Examples didn't show this leading to 'YES', so low.\n\nBelieves God influences his life: Some examples where belief was present had 'NO'. This could be protective, so low.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are past conviction (medium), marijuana use (high), and possibly living alone (medium). The protective factors like being enrolled in school and stable upbringing might counter some of these. But since drug use is a strong indicator, I'm leaning towards 'YES' with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is relatively young but not necessarily indicative of recidivism based on examples.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals in the examples had mixed outcomes, so race alone isn't a strong predictor.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate some criminal history, which can be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"No correlation between weight and recidivism observed in the examples.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase risk, as seen in some 'YES' outcomes.\"),\n     (\"Education/Enrollment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or economic challenges, which can be a risk factor.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates in the examples.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area may offer some protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing God influences life was not a significant factor for 'YES' outcomes in examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
