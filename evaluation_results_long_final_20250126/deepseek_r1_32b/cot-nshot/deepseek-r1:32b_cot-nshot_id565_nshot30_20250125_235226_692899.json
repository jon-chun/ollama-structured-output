    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is a low risk. She's 19, which is relatively young, but not the youngest in the examples. Some younger individuals might have higher risks, but she's on the lower end of the spectrum compared to others.\n\nSex is female, which is another low risk factor because females generally have lower rearrest rates than males. The data shows that being male can be a medium or high risk, so female is safer here.\n\nRace is White. From the examples, race didn't seem to play a significant role in outcomes. There were both White and Black individuals with YES and NO outcomes, so I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a medium risk because having an arrest history increases the likelihood of rearrest, even without a conviction. It shows some involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'4\" and 115 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem to correlate with recidivism, so they're low risk.\n\nMarital status is single, living alone. That's medium because living alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support, which might increase the risk slightly compared to someone living with family.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This is a strong protective factor. Education often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this is low risk.\n\nEmployment: She's held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is another positive indicator, making this a low risk.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in the past four years. That's definitely a low risk because substance abuse can be a significant factor in recidivism. Not using drugs reduces that risk.\n\nMental health: Some time feeling down. This is medium because depression or mental health issues can sometimes lead to behaviors that increase rearrest chances, but it's not as severe as other factors.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family upbringing is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nBelief in God: She considers God influential. This is medium because religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, most of her risk factors are low or medium, with only a few being medium. The protective factors like education, no drug use, stable family background, and current employment are significant. The arrest history is the main concern, but without a conviction, it's less impactful. Her mental health issues add some risk, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nI'm leaning towards predicting NO rearrest within three years with high confidence because of her strong protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is relatively young and not in a high-risk age bracket for recidivism\"),\n     (\"Sex\", \"low\", \"Female gender generally has lower rearrest rates compared to males\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have varying rearrest rates, but race alone isn't a strong predictor\"),\n     (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some level of involvement in the justice system\"),\n     (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not correlate strongly with recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less supervision or support, which can be a risk factor\"),\n     (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college is protective against rearrest as education often correlates with lower recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs suggests stable employment, which is associated with lower recidivism\"),\n     (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk factors related to substance abuse\"),\n     (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time may indicate potential mental health issues that could contribute to rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area suggests a stable upbringing, which is protective\"),\n     (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Considering God as influential can provide support but isn't a strong predictor of recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
