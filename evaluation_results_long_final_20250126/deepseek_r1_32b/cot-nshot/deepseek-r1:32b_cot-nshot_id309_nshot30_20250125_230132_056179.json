    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. I'll go through each risk factor one by one, assign a weight based on the examples provided, and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, looking at age: the person is 18 years old. In the examples, younger individuals (like 19-20) sometimes had rearrests, but it's not always clear if age directly correlates. I'll mark this as low risk because being young might mean more opportunities for change, though it's a bit early to tell.\n\nSex is male, which in many studies is a higher risk factor since males are generally more likely to recidivate. So, I'll assign medium weight here.\n\nRace: White. From the examples, both Black and White individuals had rearrests. It doesn't seem like race was a decisive factor, so low risk.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: 1 time arrested and convicted. In some cases with one arrest, there were rearrests (like example 29), but others didn't. I'll give this medium weight because having a conviction might indicate a higher likelihood.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 153 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant to recidivism in the examples, so low risk.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Some examples showed that living alone can be a factor, but not always. I'll mark this as medium because being single might contribute to instability.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually reduces recidivism, but since he's currently studying, it's positive. So low risk here.\n\nEmployment: Held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor. This should be high because without employment, there might be fewer positive activities to keep him engaged.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism, so this gets a high weight.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed in the past month. That's good; no mental health issues noted here. Low risk.\n\nLiving situation as a child: Lived with biological mother in a household size 2, urban area. Family stability can be positive, but living alone now might have more impact. I'll mark this as low because the childhood environment was stable.\n\nBelief in God: Considers that God has something to do with his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism. Low risk.\n\nNow, putting it all together: High weights are employment and drug use. Medium are sex and marital status. The rest are low. Given the high unemployment and active drug use, these are strong indicators for potential rearrest. However, he's enrolled in college, which is positive. I'll predict a medium confidence that there might be a rearrest, but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate potential for change, though it's early to assess long-term behavior.\"),\n     (\"sex\", \"medium\", \"Male sex is a known factor associated with higher recidivism rates in many studies.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not appear to be a decisive factor based on the examples provided.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted may indicate some likelihood of reoffending, though it's not definitive.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are unlikely to influence recidivism directly.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone might contribute to instability, a factor in recidivism.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college suggests positive engagement which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year indicates potential unemployment, a significant risk factor for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported in the past month suggests no current mental health issues impacting behavior.\"),\n     (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Stable living with biological mother may provide some protective factors, though less impactful now.\"),\n     (\"religion_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might offer support but isn't a primary factor in the examples.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
