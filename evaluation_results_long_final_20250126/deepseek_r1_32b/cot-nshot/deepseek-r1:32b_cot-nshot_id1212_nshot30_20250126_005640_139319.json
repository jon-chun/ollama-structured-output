    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age. The person is 21 years old. From the examples, younger individuals might have a higher chance of rearrest, but not all do. It's not the strongest indicator on its own, so I'll rate age as low weight.\n\nNext, race: Black. In many studies and examples, race can be a factor, but it's important to consider other factors alongside it. So medium weight here.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested once and convicted. Previous convictions are significant because they show past behavior that could indicate future actions. That seems high.\n\nMarital status: Never married. While not the strongest predictor alone, being single might correlate with higher risk in some contexts. Medium weight.\n\nResidence: Living alone. People living alone might have less supervision or support, which could be a medium factor.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism because it limits opportunities. That's high.\n\nEmployment history: Held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to more criminal activity due to lack of legitimate income sources. High weight here.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in past four years. This is a positive sign, reducing risk. Low weight since it's a protective factor.\n\nMental health: Most of the time felt down. Depression or low mood can increase recidivism risk by affecting decision-making and behavior. Medium weight.\n\nFamily background: Lived with mother in a large urban household. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more context, it's hard to assess. Low weight.\n\nSpirituality: Believes God has nothing to do with his life. Lack of spiritual support might contribute to higher risk. Medium weight.\n\nPutting all these together, the high weights on education and employment are significant negatives, arrest history is a strong indicator, mental health issues add to the risk, but lack of drug use helps slightly. The combination leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; younger age may indicate potential for change but not necessarily high risk alone\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic factors contributing to recidivism\"),\n     (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Convicted after one arrest suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest compared to non-convicted cases\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; single status can sometimes correlate with higher risk but varies widely\"),\n     (\"Residence\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision and support networks\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits opportunities, increasing recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year can lead to increased criminal activity due to limited legitimate income sources\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a protective factor against rearrest\"),\n     (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Most of the time feeling down indicates potential mental health struggles that could influence behavior\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Lived with mother in an urban area; family dynamics can have varying impacts without additional context\"),\n     (\"Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life, which may lack a supportive spiritual framework\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
