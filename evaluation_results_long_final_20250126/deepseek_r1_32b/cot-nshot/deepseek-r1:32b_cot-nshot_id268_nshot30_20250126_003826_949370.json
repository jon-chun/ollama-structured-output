    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this case and predict whether there will be a rearrest within three years. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male with several arrests and convictions. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age. He's 21, which isn't too high or low in the examples given. Some people at similar ages had rearrests, others didn't. So maybe this is a medium risk factor because being in early adulthood can mean varying outcomes.\n\nNext, ethnicity: Hispanic. I don't see any specific patterns based on ethnicity in the provided examples. Most cases were Black or White, so it's hard to say if Hispanic has an impact here. I'll rate this as low since there's no data to suggest otherwise.\n\nConvictions: He's been arrested four times and convicted. In previous examples, higher numbers of arrests and convictions correlated with \"YES\" outcomes. For instance, example 29 had one arrest without conviction and was \"NO,\" while others with multiple convictions were \"YES.\" So this seems like a high risk factor because more convictions often lead to rearrest.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone. Some examples showed that living alone could be either positive or negative. However, in cases where he's not connected to family, maybe it's a medium risk because it might indicate less support but isn't a direct cause of recidivism.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is important; having a diploma is good, but not further education might limit opportunities. This seems like a low risk factor since having some education can help prevent recidivism.\n\nEmployment history: He's held three jobs this year. Job stability is key. In example 28, someone with three jobs didn't rearrest, while others with inconsistent work had worse outcomes. So steady employment might lower the risk; I'll rate this as low because it shows some stability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant factor. In example 7, drug use was a high risk leading to rearrest. Since he's using drugs, that could increase his chances of rearrest, so this is medium.\n\nMental health: No depression symptoms recently. Good mental health lowers risk. So this is low because no signs of depression.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in an urban area as a child. Family stability can be protective. In example 29, living with both parents was associated with \"NO.\" So family support might lower the risk, making it a medium factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God influences his life. Religious involvement is generally protective against recidivism. This seems low because positive religious engagement can reduce rearrest chances.\n\nPutting all together: High risk from convictions, medium from drug use and family background. Other factors are low. The high conviction history weighs heavily towards a \"YES\" prediction. So I'm leaning towards predicting a 3-year rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which falls in the early adulthood range where recidivism rates can vary based on other factors.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone does not show a clear pattern of influence on rearrest outcomes in the provided examples.\"),\n     (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested 4 times and convicted is a strong indicator of higher risk for rearrest due to previous encounters with the justice system.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support, which may contribute to recidivism but isn't a direct cause.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma suggests some level of educational attainment, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability, which can be protective against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use (marijuana) within the past four years is a risk factor that could contribute to recidivism if substance use continues or escalates.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month suggests better mental health, which can reduce the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area provides some stability, but living alone now may reduce family support.\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has influence over life could provide moral guidance and lower the risk of recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
