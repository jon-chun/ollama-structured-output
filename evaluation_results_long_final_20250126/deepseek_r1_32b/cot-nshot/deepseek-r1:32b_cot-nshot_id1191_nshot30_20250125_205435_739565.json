    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014based on how significant they seem in contributing to recidivism.\n\nFirst, the individual is 22 years old. Looking at the examples, age doesn't seem to be a major factor. Most people are around 19-22, so this isn't particularly high risk. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's male. From the examples, males make up the majority of cases and recidivism seems slightly higher among them, but it's not a dominant factor. So medium weight here because gender is somewhat relevant but not the strongest indicator.\n\nIdentifies as Black. In the examples, being Black doesn't consistently correlate with rearrest. It's part of the demographic but not a major predictor. Low weight.\n\nArrested 2 times and convicted. This seems important. Having prior convictions increases the risk. Looking at the examples, higher number of arrests often leads to YES outcomes. So high weight here because past behavior is a strong indicator.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 152 lbs. These physical attributes don't seem relevant in the context of recidivism. Low weight.\n\nNever been married. In some cases, being unmarried can be a factor, but it's not always consistent. Maybe medium because family status can influence behavior, but not as strong as other factors.\n\nCurrently living alone. From the examples, living alone doesn't strongly predict rearrest. Some with YES are living alone, others aren't. So low weight.\n\nHas a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is somewhat relevant. Having a diploma is better, so this might be protective. Maybe medium because it's positive but not a guarantee against recidivism.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year. Employment history matters. Holding only one job could indicate instability or limited work experience, which might increase risk. Medium weight here since consistent employment can reduce recidivism.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor. In examples, drug use often leads to higher recidivism. High weight because substance abuse is linked to criminal behavior.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area as a child. Family background and upbringing might have some influence, but the examples don't show a strong correlation. Low weight.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective. In examples, this factor didn't strongly predict either way, so medium weight.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The high-weight factors are prior convictions (high) and drug use (high). Medium factors include gender, education, employment, and belief in God. Low factors cover age, race, living alone, etc. \n\nGiven that he has been convicted twice and uses marijuana, which are both strong indicators of higher risk, but his other factors like having a high school diploma and being spiritual might slightly mitigate the risk. However, the prior convictions and drug use are more impactful.\n\nI think the prediction leans towards YES with moderate confidence because while there are some protective factors, the significant past behavior increases the likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 22 is typical among cases without strong correlation to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender shows slight correlation in examples but isn't dominant.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being Black doesn't consistently predict rearrest from examples.\"),\n     (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior convictions are a strong indicator of higher risk.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight aren't relevant to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may influence behavior but isn't a major factor.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't strongly predict rearrest from examples.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is protective but not definitive.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"One job indicates possible instability affecting risk.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use correlates with higher recidivism in examples.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Upbringing details don't show strong correlation.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may offer some protection but isn't conclusive.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
