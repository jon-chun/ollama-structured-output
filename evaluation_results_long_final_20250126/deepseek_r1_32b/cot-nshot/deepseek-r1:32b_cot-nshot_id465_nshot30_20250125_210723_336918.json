    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific individual based on their risk factors. To do this, I'll analyze each factor provided, assign a weight (low, medium, high) to each, and then use these weights to make a prediction.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 years old.\n2. Sex: Female.\n3. Race: White.\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, not convicted.\n5. Weight/Height: 5'6\" and 130 lbs (this might relate to physical health or other factors but isn't a direct risk factor for rearrest).\n6. Marital status: Never married, currently living alone.\n7. Education: High school diploma; enrolled in a 4-year college.\n8. Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n9. Drug use: No drug use in the past four years.\n10. Mental health: Not felt depressed in the past month.\n11. Childhood living situation: Lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents; household size of 3 in an urban area.\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God has a role in her life.\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\n1. **Age (22):** In previous cases, age didn't seem to be a major factor unless it was very young. 22 is relatively stable, so low impact.\n   \n2. **Sex (Female):** Females generally have lower rearrest rates than males. So this might be a protective factor, hence low.\n\n3. **Race (White):** In some examples, race didn't seem to play a significant role unless other factors were present. So low.\n\n4. **Arrest history (1 arrest, no conviction):** A single arrest without conviction is less impactful compared to multiple arrests or convictions. Still, it's a minor risk factor, so medium.\n\n5. **Weight/Height:** Not directly related to rearrest likelihood, so low.\n\n6. **Marital status and living alone:** Living alone isn't inherently a risk factor unless combined with other issues. However, being single can sometimes be associated with higher risks if there are no supportive relationships. Medium consideration but leaning towards medium.\n\n7. **Education (HS diploma, in college):** Higher education is protective against recidivism. This is a strong positive factor, so low risk.\n\n8. **Employment (2 jobs):** Having stable employment reduces the likelihood of rearrest. This is a significant protective factor, so low.\n\n9. **Drug use (No recent use):** No drug use in the past four years is very positive and protective against recidivism. Low risk.\n\n10. **Mental health (Not depressed recently):** Mental health issues can be a risk factor if present. Since she hasn't felt depressed, this is a protective factor, so low.\n\n11. **Childhood living situation:** Lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. This could indicate instability, but it's not as strong a predictor compared to other factors like arrests or education. Medium impact.\n\n12. **Religious beliefs:** Believing God has a role might provide support and reduce recidivism risk. This is protective, so low.\n\nNow, compiling the weights:\n\n- Low: Age, Sex, Race, Education, Employment, No drug use, Mental health, Religious beliefs.\n- Medium: Arrest history, Marital status/living alone, Childhood living situation.\n\nThe majority of factors are low risk, with a few medium ones. The protective factors like education, employment, and lack of substance use are strong. The single arrest is minor, and while living alone might be a slight concern, it's not as significant without other issues.\n\nConsidering the examples, individuals with similar profiles (educated, employed, no drug use) tend to have lower recidivism rates. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22 is relatively stable and less likely to influence recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Sex\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates than males, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n     (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Race White doesn't significantly impact recidivism compared to other factors in the examples.\"),\n     (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction is a minor risk but still considered medium weight.\"),\n     (\"Weight/Height\", \"low\", \"Not directly related to rearrest likelihood, thus low impact.\"),\n     (\"Marital status/living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be associated with higher risks if lacking support, hence medium consideration.\"),\n     (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Higher education reduces recidivism risk; a strong protective factor.\"),\n     (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment lowers rearrest likelihood, significant protection.\"),\n     (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently provides a protective effect.\"),\n     (\"Childhood living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents may indicate instability but isn't as impactful as other factors.\"),\n     (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 0.85\n}\n```",
