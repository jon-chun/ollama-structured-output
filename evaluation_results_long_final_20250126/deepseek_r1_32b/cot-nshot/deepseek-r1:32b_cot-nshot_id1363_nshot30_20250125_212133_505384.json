    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction for this case. Let's go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 22. In previous cases, younger ages like 19-20 sometimes led to \"NO\" predictions, but being older might not necessarily mean lower risk. I think age alone isn't a strong indicator, so maybe it's low weight.\n\nNext, race as Black. Looking at the examples, some Black individuals had \"YES\" outcomes, others \"NO\". It doesn't seem like a consistent factor on its own, so probably low weight.\n\nArrest count is 6 times with convictions. That's high because multiple arrests, especially with convictions, are strong indicators of recidivism. So this should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 180 lbs) don't seem relevant in the examples. No impact on prediction, so low weight.\n\nNever married. In some cases, being unmarried was present but not always leading to \"YES\". It might have some influence, so medium weight.\n\nLiving alone. Some examples had living alone and others didn't; no clear pattern. Maybe medium because it could indicate lack of support but isn't definitive.\n\nGED certificate without college enrollment. Education can be protective, but not having higher education might limit opportunities. Medium weight as it's somewhat relevant.\n\nNo jobs held during the year. Unemployment is a strong risk factor in many cases leading to \"YES\". High weight here because joblessness often correlates with recidivism.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a significant predictor, especially multiple drugs. High weight.\n\nFeeling down some of the time. Mental health issues can contribute but aren't as strong as other factors. Medium weight since it's present but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nLiving situation: adults other than biological/foster/adoptive parents in an urban area. This might indicate unstable upbringing or environment, which could be a medium factor.\n\nBelief in God. In some cases, religious beliefs were protective (\"NO\"), but others had \"YES\". So low weight because it's inconsistent.\n\nPutting it all together: high weights on arrest count and no jobs, medium on unemployment, drugs, mental health, living situation. Low on age, race, marital status, education, belief in God, height/weight.\n\nThe strongest factors are the 6 arrests with convictions and lack of employment, both high risk. Substance abuse is another high factor. The combination suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age of 22 falls in the middle range, not strongly indicative on its own.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race as Black is considered but not a standalone indicator.\"),\n     (\"arrest_count_convictions\", \"high\", \"6 arrests with convictions indicate significant risk.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are irrelevant to recidivism prediction.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may suggest lack of support systems.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could imply limited social support.\"),\n     (\"education_attainment\", \"medium\", \"GED without college might limit opportunities.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs increase risk due to potential unemployment issues.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong predictor.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down suggests possible mental health challenges.\"),\n     (\"upbringing_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in urban area may indicate instability.\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be protective but varies by case.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
