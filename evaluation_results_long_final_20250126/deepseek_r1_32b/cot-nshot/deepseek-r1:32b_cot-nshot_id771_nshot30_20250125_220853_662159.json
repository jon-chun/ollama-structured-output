    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at age: he's 22 years old. In previous examples, younger individuals (like 19-22) were more likely to have a \"YES\" prediction. But I should check if that's consistent across the data.\n\nNext, ethnicity is Hispanic. The examples mostly involved Black and White individuals, so there isn't much info on Hispanic. Maybe it doesn't influence as much without specific data points.\n\nArrest history: 3 arrests with convictions. That seems significant because higher arrest counts often lead to \"YES\" outcomes. For example, someone arrested twice was predicted YES, so three might be even higher risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 160 lbs. These don't seem related to recidivism in the examples, so probably low impact.\n\nMarital status: Not married but not living alone. I'm not sure how this affects it; maybe having a support system could lower risk?\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not enrolled in college. In some cases, higher education was associated with \"NO,\" but without further study, it's neutral here.\n\nEmployment: Held only 1 job in the year. Unstable employment might increase risk. Previous examples showed that fewer jobs were linked to higher recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in the past four years. That's a positive sign; substance abuse is often tied to higher recidivism, so no use could lower risk.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he hasn't been depressed, that might lower it.\n\nLiving situation as a child: Lived with biological mother in a small household (size 2). I'm not sure how family structure affects this without more data; maybe smaller households don't show much impact.\n\nBelief about God: Doesn't consider God influential. In some examples, lack of religious belief was associated with higher recidivism. So that might be a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Most factors are neutral or low except for arrest history (high), employment instability (medium), and possibly the lack of religious influence (medium). The positive factors like no drug use and not feeling depressed might counterbalance some risks, but the high number of convictions is a strong indicator. I think the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old is within a typical range for recidivism analysis, not particularly high risk.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity not strongly predictive in provided examples.\"),\n     (\"Arrest History (3 times with conviction)\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and convictions indicate higher likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes unlikely to influence recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (not married, not living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living situation may affect social support but not conclusively\"),\n     (\"Education (high school diploma)\", \"low\", \"Completed high school, neutral factor in examples\"),\n     (\"Employment (1 job)\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment could increase risk\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (none)\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces recidivism likelihood\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (not depressed)\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms lower risk\"),\n     (\"Childhood Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with mother in small household, no clear impact\"),\n     (\"Belief About God\", \"medium\", \"Doesn't consider God influential, linked to higher recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
