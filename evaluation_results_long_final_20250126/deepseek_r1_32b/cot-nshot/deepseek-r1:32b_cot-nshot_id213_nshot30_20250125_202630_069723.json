    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this case. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals (like 19-23) seem to have mixed outcomes. Some had \"YES\" and others \"NO\", so maybe age isn't a huge factor here but still somewhat relevant. I'll give it low weight.\n\nNext, race as Black. In the examples, being Black didn't consistently predict recidivism. There were both \"YES\" and \"NO\" cases, so race might not be a strong indicator. Low weight again.\n\nNumber of arrests is 2 times without conviction. The examples show that multiple arrests can lead to higher risk. For instance, example 7 had 2 arrests with convictions and was \"YES\". Even without conviction, having been arrested twice could indicate risky behavior. So this should be high weight.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. In several cases, lack of education correlated with \"YES\" outcomes. This seems like a significant factor because it can limit opportunities and increase risk. High weight here.\n\nEmployment status: Held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is often linked to higher recidivism. Examples where people had multiple jobs sometimes ended up with \"NO\", but having none might indicate instability or lack of resources, so this is high weight too.\n\nSubstance use: Marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but it's not always leading to rearrest. Some examples with drug use were \"YES\" and others \"NO\". So medium weight.\n\nMental health: Not depressed in the past month. That seems positive, so low weight as it doesn't contribute negatively.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone. In some cases, living alone was associated with higher risk, but not always. Mixed signals, so medium weight.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological dad in a small household. Family structure can influence outcomes. A stable single-parent home might have different effects compared to other situations. Medium weight here as well.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has an impact on his life. In some examples, this was associated with \"NO\" recidivism, suggesting positive influence. Low weight since it's a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-weight factors like multiple arrests, no education, and unemployment are strong indicators of higher risk. Substance use and living alone add to that. The protective factors might slightly lower the overall risk but aren't enough to offset the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age 22 is within a common range for recidivism, but not strongly indicative on its own\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race as Black has shown mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n     (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without conviction suggest potential risk behavior\"),\n     (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED and no college enrollment indicate limited opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year suggests unemployment, a known recidivism factor\"),\n     (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is present but not always predictive\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed reduces mental health risks\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to risk factors\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up with biological dad in a small household has mixed implications\"),\n     (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is a protective factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
