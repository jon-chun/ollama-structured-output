    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male's 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at his age: he's 19 years old. In the examples, younger individuals like 18 or 19 sometimes had \"YES\" outcomes, but not always. It depends on other factors too. So I'll rate this as low because while being young is a risk factor, it might be less impactful compared to others.\n\nNext, his ethnicity is Hispanic. The examples don't specify much about Hispanic individuals, so I can't assign a high weight here. Maybe it's medium if there's some data on recidivism rates for Hispanic males, but without specific info from the examples, I'll go with low.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, having prior arrests often led to \"YES\" outcomes, especially when combined with other factors. So this is a significant factor; I'll mark it as high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11 and 230 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly relate to recidivism in the examples. Maybe if someone is underweight or has health issues, but here it's average. Low impact, so low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone. The examples show that being single isn't a strong predictor on its own. It might be medium because some cases with single individuals had \"YES\" outcomes, but not all. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can play a role; having a diploma is positive, but not continuing education might be neutral. The examples don't highlight this as a major factor, so low weight.\n\nHeld three jobs during the year. Employment history is mixed in the examples. Multiple jobs could indicate instability or responsibility. I'll consider it medium because inconsistent employment can sometimes correlate with recidivism.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor in many cases, especially when combined with other factors. This seems high as substance abuse often leads to higher recidivism rates.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of five during childhood. Family background can be a factor. Growing up in a single-parent home might influence outcomes, but it's not the strongest predictor alone. So medium weight.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs were mentioned in some examples, sometimes leading to \"NO\" recidivism. This could be protective, so I'll rate this as low because it's a positive factor that might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest factors are prior conviction and drug use. The prior conviction is high, and drug use is also high. Other factors like age, living alone, and employment are medium or low. Considering these, especially the strong indicators of past conviction and substance abuse, I'm leaning towards predicting a \"YES\" outcome for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"19-year-old is relatively young; age can be a risk factor but not as significant compared to other factors.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity does not have specific weight in examples provided\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Convicted after arrest, which is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can indicate potential instability\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college; education level is neutral here\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held three jobs indicating possible job instability or seeking\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of five; family background can influence but not the strongest predictor\"),\n     (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has role, which might indicate positive coping mechanisms\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
