    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 22-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014based on how significant they are in predicting recidivism.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Looking at previous examples, people aged around 19-22 have varied outcomes. Some were rearrested, others weren't. So I think age alone isn't a strong predictor here. That's probably a low weight.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, prior arrests without conviction sometimes led to rearrests, but it wasn't consistent. This might be medium because having any criminal history can indicate risk, even if not convicted.\n\nHis height and weight\u20145'10\" and 180 lbs\u2014are pretty average for his age. I don't see how these physical attributes relate directly to recidivism. So that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Being single isn't a strong indicator on its own, but living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually reduces recidivism risk because it provides skills and opportunities. This should be low weight as it's protective.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year, showing some stability. Employment can lower recidivism rates, so this is another low factor.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because drugs can lead to criminal behavior. This should be high weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month suggests better mental health, which is protective. That's low.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Family instability and environment can affect outcomes. Urban areas might have more crime exposure. I'd say medium risk here because it could influence behavior but isn't the strongest factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's low weight.\n\nNow, putting this all together: most factors are low or medium, except for drug use which is high. The protective factors like education, employment, no depression might outweigh some risks. But the substance abuse is a strong indicator. However, his current stability with college and jobs might mitigate that risk. I'm leaning towards NO rearrest, but not entirely confident because of the drug history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"Age 22 is young, but not necessarily predictive of recidivism without other factors\"),\n     (\"Prior Arrests (1, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests some risk, but less than a conviction\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight (5'10\\\", 180 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are unlikely to influence rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less supervision or support, which could increase risk\"),\n     (\"Education (High school diploma, enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"Higher education is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"Employment (2 jobs during the year)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment suggests responsibility and reduces recidivism likelihood\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (No depression in past month)\", \"low\", \"Good mental health is protective against recidivism\"),\n     (\"Childhood Living Situation (With non-biological adults in urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in an urban environment may indicate instability or higher crime exposure\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief (Believes God influences life)\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
