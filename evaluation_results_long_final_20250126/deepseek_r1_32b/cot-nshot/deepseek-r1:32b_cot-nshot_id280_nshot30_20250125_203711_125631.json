    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male, Black. From the examples, race seems to have some impact because several cases where individuals were Black resulted in YES outcomes, especially when combined with other high-risk factors like multiple arrests or drug use.\n\nHe has been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted yet. In the examples, higher arrest counts without conviction might still be a significant factor. For instance, example #30 had 1 arrest and no conviction but was predicted NO. But someone with 6 arrests might have a higher risk because frequent contact with law enforcement can sometimes indicate ongoing behavior.\n\nHe's living alone, which in some cases is neutral or slightly negative. However, not having a support system could be a medium factor because it might affect his ability to stay out of trouble.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This seems like a significant risk factor across multiple examples\u2014lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. So, I'll rate this as high.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Job stability is another key factor. In some cases, having more jobs was considered medium or high risk because it might indicate instability. However, holding just one job could be low if he's consistent there but maybe not enough to offset other risks.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently are both positive signs. These should lower the risk because substance abuse and mental health issues often contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area, which is a protective factor. Stable family background can reduce recidivism chances, so this should be low or no impact.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life, another positive factor that might help him stay on track, so low risk here too.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), lack of education (high), living alone (medium). The protective factors like stable family and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. But the high arrest count without conviction is concerning. Comparing to examples, someone with 6 arrests but no convictions might be more likely to recidivate than those with fewer arrests or convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21-year-old male is at a typical age for recidivism risk, not particularly high or low\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals have been shown to have higher rearrest rates in examples\"),\n     (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"6 arrests without conviction indicates frequent contact with law enforcement and potential behavioral risks\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married, but no indication of negative impact from this factor\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college correlates with higher recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job during the year may indicate limited stability\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces substance-related risks\"),\n     (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed over the past month suggests good mental health\"),\n     (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone could affect support systems and stability\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in urban area indicates stable upbringing\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
