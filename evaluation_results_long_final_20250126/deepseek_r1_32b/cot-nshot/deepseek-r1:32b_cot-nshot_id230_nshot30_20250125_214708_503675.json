    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may not have stable circumstances. So, I'd rate age as medium.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted. That seems significant because prior convictions are a strong predictor of future arrests. I'll assign high weight to this factor.\n\nEthnicity is White. The examples don't show a clear pattern, but sometimes minority groups might face systemic issues, but without more data, it's low.\n\nHeight and weight (5'7\" and 168 lbs) are pretty average; they don't seem relevant here. So, low for both.\n\nMarital status: never married. Some studies suggest that being unmarried can be a risk factor, so medium.\n\nLiving alone might indicate lack of support, which could contribute to recidivism. That's another medium.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education typically lowers recidivism, so low weight here.\n\nEmployment: only held one job this year. Unstable employment can be a risk, so medium.\n\nDrug use includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major factor, so high.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently might seem positive, but mental health issues are complex. Maybe it's low unless there's more info.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area as a child. Stable upbringing can be protective, so low.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Religious involvement often reduces recidivism, so low.\n\nNow, looking at the examples: those with multiple arrests and convictions are more likely to have \"YES.\" He has two arrests and is convicted, which aligns with some of the \"YES\" cases. But he's in college and has a stable upbringing, which might lower risk. However, drug use and living alone could counterbalance that.\n\nI think the prediction leans towards \"YES,\" but not extremely confident because there are mitigating factors like education and family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which may indicate a higher risk of recidivism due to younger age compared to older individuals who may have more stable life circumstances.\"),\n     (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested twice and convicted suggests a pattern that could lead to future rearrests.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation observed in the examples between ethnicity and recidivism for White individuals.\"),\n     (\"Height (5 feet 7 inches)\", \"low\", \"Physical height is not typically associated with recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Weight (168 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Body weight does not have a direct relationship with rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"Marital status (Never married)\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates due to lack of certain support systems.\"),\n     (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate fewer social supports which could potentially increase risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Education level (high school diploma, enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in higher education are protective factors against recidivism as they provide opportunities for positive development and stability.\"),\n     (\"Employment status (held 1 job during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job might indicate some level of instability or limited employment history which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in past four years)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially involving illicit substances like cocaine, is strongly associated with higher risks of rearrest due to potential legal issues and substance-related crimes.\"),\n     (\"Mental health status (not felt depressed last month)\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently may indicate better mental health at the time but does not necessarily predict future mental states or behaviors.\"),\n     (\"Childhood living situation (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents generally is considered a protective factor against recidivism as it often provides stability and support during formative years.\"),\n     (\"Religious beliefs (believes God has influence over life)\", \"low\", \"Having religious beliefs can sometimes serve as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and social support, which may reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
