    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. I know that younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor because it provides opportunities and structure. Being enrolled in college suggests he's engaged and has goals, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides income and structure. Having two jobs might show instability, but it's better than none. I'm leaning towards low risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is protective, so this is low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stable family mitigates that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are his age and drug use. While he has some protective factors like education and family, the drug use is a strong indicator. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because of the positive factors in his life.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests some risk but is not as significant as multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates some stability, though frequent job changes could suggest instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially with multiple substances, is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
