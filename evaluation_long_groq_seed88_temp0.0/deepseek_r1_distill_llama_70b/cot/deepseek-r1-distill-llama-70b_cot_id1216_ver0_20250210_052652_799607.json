    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet, which is average to above average. I don't think height itself is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living alone can sometimes indicate a lack of strong social support, which might increase recidivism risk. However, it's not a very strong indicator on its own, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is important. Having only one job could suggest some instability, which might increase the risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Drug use is a known risk factor, but since he's abstained, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and a larger household could mean less individual attention, but living with a biological parent is a positive. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors are age, living situation, employment, and mental health. However, the presence of protective factors like education, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs might mitigate the risk. So I'm leaning towards a lower overall risk, predicting \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year could suggest employment instability, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area with a larger household may have some risks but is not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
