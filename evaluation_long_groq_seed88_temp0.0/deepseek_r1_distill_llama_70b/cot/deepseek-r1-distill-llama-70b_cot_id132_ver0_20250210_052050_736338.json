    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it's still significant.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be extremely high, but having a conviction shows a history of more serious offenses. I think this is a medium risk factor as well.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably a low risk factor. It doesn't really contribute much to recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable family support, which can be a risk factor. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which is a known risk factor. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is less severe than other drugs, any drug use can still be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents at a young age in a large household might indicate an unstable upbringing, which is a risk factor. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which could be a protective factor, providing emotional support. This might lower his risk, so I'll rate it low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium, with a couple high and low. The high education factor is concerning, but the belief in God might help. Overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance use issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to recidivism if left untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a large household at a young age may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
