    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet settled into stable life patterns. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's been involved in criminal activity, but the lack of convictions could mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. However, multiple arrests suggest ongoing issues, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis living situation is alone, which could mean less support and more isolation. Living alone, especially in an urban area, might contribute to higher risk if he doesn't have a strong support system. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one, but he's not in college. Not being enrolled in further education might limit his opportunities, leading to higher risk. This is a medium factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So, unemployment is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this might lower his risk a bit. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHis upbringing was in a large household of seven in an urban area. Growing up in a crowded, urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates and social influences that increase recidivism risk. This is a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like age, unemployment, and drug use. These are strong predictors. However, the lack of conviction and stable education (GED) might slightly mitigate the risk. Overall, I think he's at high risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential involvement in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"While multiple arrests indicate potential criminal activity, the lack of convictions suggests that the legal system did not find sufficient evidence for guilt, which might lower the risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending, especially in urban areas where community ties may be weaker.\"),\n    (\"GED and no college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is a positive factor, but not pursuing further education or employment can limit opportunities and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly with substances like cocaine, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential addiction and related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"no recent depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator, as mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"large household and urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime rates and social influences that can increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
