    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while he's young, he's not a juvenile anymore, so the risk isn't as high as it would be for someone younger.\n\nNext, he's been arrested nine times. That's a significant number, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Each arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been convicted, which means he's had contact with the criminal justice system beyond just arrests. This shows that his offenses were serious enough to lead to a conviction, which is another high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, but since he's abstained for four years, this actually lowers his risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces the risk of self-harm or other negative behaviors, so both of these are low-risk factors.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 14 in an urban area. Large households can sometimes lead to less individual attention, and urban areas might have higher crime rates, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, convictions, unemployment, and living alone. However, he also has some protective factors like no recent drug use or depression and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19, he is young but not a juvenile, which is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted shows serious offenses, elevating the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes alone don't indicate criminal propensity.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest limited social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence for four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers the risk of negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"household and upbringing\", \"medium\", \"A large urban household may expose him to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
