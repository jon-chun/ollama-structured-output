    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis marital status is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive as it shows he has some education. However, he's not enrolled in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which could increase the likelihood of criminal activity. So unemployment is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use is another important factor. He's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it most of the time in the past month. Drug use, especially frequent use, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHis mental health is a concern too. He's felt down most of the time in the past month, which could indicate depression. Poor mental health can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, reducing the risk. So family background is low.\n\nHe has a religious belief, thinking God influences his life. Religious involvement can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are unemployment and drug use. Medium factors are age and mental health. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because there are both high and low factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests some involvement with the law but is not as significant as multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED indicates some level of education, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and frequent marijuana use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of illegal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down most of the time could indicate depression, which may increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
