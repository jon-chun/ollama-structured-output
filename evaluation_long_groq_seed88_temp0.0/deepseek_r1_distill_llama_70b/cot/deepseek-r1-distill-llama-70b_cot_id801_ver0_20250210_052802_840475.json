    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'll mark age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it still indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not a repeated offense, but it's still a concern.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 220 lbs. While being physically larger might be a factor in certain contexts, I don't see it as a direct indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support. This could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can provide opportunities and stability, so not pursuing higher education might limit his options, increasing the risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity, either to support a habit or due to impaired judgment. I'll mark this as high.\n\nHe's experienced depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed, as they might lead to poor decision-making or further substance abuse. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background can be protective, so this might actually be a lower risk factor. However, urban environments might have higher crime rates, which could be a risk. I'm a bit torn here, but I think the stable family background might outweigh the urban factor, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence in his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors are medium or high. His age, drug use, and employment instability are significant. However, he has a stable family background and some education, which are positive. I think the prediction leans towards a higher risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes can signal instability, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk due to associated behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase risk if not adequately managed, affecting decision-making.\"),\n    (\"upbringing and environment\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective, though urban environment might pose risks.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
