    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis living situation is alone, which could mean less support and more isolation. Living alone, especially at a young age, might contribute to higher risk because there's no family support to provide guidance or stability. So I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive because it shows he has some education. Not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, but having a GED is better than not having any diploma. This could be a protective factor, so I'll rate education as low risk.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might indicate issues with maintaining steady work, which can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So I'll rate employment as medium.\n\nDrug use is another factor. He's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is less severe than other drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of risky behavior. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower his risk. So mental health is low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six could mean he had less individual attention and possibly more exposure to stress or instability. Larger households might have more chaos, which can contribute to behavioral issues. I'll rate family environment as medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support and different coping mechanisms, which might increase risk. So I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several medium risk factors and a couple of high ones. His age and employment instability are significant. However, he has some protective factors like education and lack of current mental health issues. I think the prediction leans towards a higher risk, so I'll predict YES. My confidence is around 75% because while there are several risk factors, some protective elements might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and increase isolation, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED is a protective factor, indicating some educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability and increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe, can still impair judgment and increase risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"A larger household may have contributed to environmental stressors.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce social support and coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
