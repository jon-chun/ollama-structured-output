    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history. This could be a moderate indicator, so I'll mark it as medium.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'8\" and 200-224 lbs. While this might affect certain types of offenses, it's not a strong indicator on its own for recidivism. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 18 is common, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to further criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might contribute to recidivism. However, having multiple jobs might also show an attempt to gain stability, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down most of the past month. Depression or mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not addressed. This is another high risk factor.\n\nHer living situation as a child was with non-biological adults in an urban area. An unstable home environment can contribute to behavioral issues and increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe believes God influences her personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and reducing recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education, drug use, and mental health issues. Medium factors include age, employment instability, and childhood living situation. Low factors are her physical build, living alone, and religious beliefs. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong indicators, there's also potential for intervention, especially with her youth and possible support systems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"While height and weight can sometimes be a factor in certain types of crimes, they are not strong indicators of recidivism on their own.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is not uncommon, and while it may indicate a lack of strong social support, it's not a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for most of the past month could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"childhood living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in an urban area at a young age could contribute to behavioral issues and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
