    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some past issues but not a strong criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 125-149 lbs. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk, but not being married at 19 is common. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and fewer opportunities, which are known risk factors. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common but can be a risk if it's frequent or linked to other issues. I'll consider this a medium risk factor since it's not a harder drug.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and unemployment/education status. Medium factors are prior arrest and drug use. The rest are low. So, I think he's at a moderate risk overall, leading me to predict a YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build is not a significant indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but it is not a strong risk factor at this age.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and fewer opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still pose a risk, especially if frequent or linked to other issues.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which reduces the risk of recidivism linked to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background with biological mother is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
