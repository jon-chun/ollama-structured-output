    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests aren't extremely high, but having a conviction does indicate some criminal history. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some involvement with the law, but it's not an extensive record.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'3\" and 145 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a strong predictor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living situation can be stabilizing factors. Not being married and living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the risk. So medium here.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could mean he's struggling to maintain employment, which is a risk for recidivism. So medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nHe felt down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. Maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several medium risk factors and a couple of low ones. His criminal history, age, employment instability, and mental health are the main concerns. However, the absence of drug use is a positive. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors like no drug use and having a high school diploma. So I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could impact behavior if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may have minimal impact on recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
