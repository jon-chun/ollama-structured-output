    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because she's still young but not a minor anymore.\n\nShe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, showing a pattern of behavior. This seems like a high risk factor because frequent arrests often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but not being married at 19 isn't unusual. I'm not sure how much this impacts recidivism, so maybe low.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing structure and opportunities, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. I'm leaning towards medium risk here because job instability can be a stressor.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but her family stability might mitigate that.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism. This is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are her arrest history and drug use. Medium factors are her age and job instability. The rest are low. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while the high factors are strong, the presence of education and stable upbringing might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19, she is in a high-risk age group for impulsive behavior, which is a medium risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a high risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs in a year suggests instability, which is a medium risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school provides structure and opportunities, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
