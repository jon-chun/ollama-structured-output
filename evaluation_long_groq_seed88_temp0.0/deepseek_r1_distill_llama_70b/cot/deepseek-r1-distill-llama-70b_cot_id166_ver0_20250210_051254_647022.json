    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially males, tend to have higher crime rates. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's either not committing serious crimes or maybe he's getting off due to other reasons. I'm thinking this is a medium risk factor because multiple arrests suggest some level of involvement, but no convictions might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'4\" and 185 lbs. That's pretty tall and maybe underweight. I don't see how this directly relates to criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk, but not being married at 21 isn't unusual. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower education can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job. I'm leaning towards medium risk here because job instability can be a factor in recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a bigger risk factor, so this is low.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, but urban environments can have higher crime rates. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. I'll mark this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, he has some medium risk factors like age, arrests, education, employment, and mental health. But he also has some low factors like no drug use and stable upbringing. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially males, are statistically more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential criminal involvement, though lack of convictions may indicate lesser severity or successful legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stature does not strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living alone\", \"low\", \"While living alone may indicate less social support, it is not a strong predictor of criminal behavior at this age.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor significantly.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed issues that might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has a weak correlation with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
