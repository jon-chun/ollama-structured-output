    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a moderate risk factor because, while he's not a juvenile anymore, he's still relatively young.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. So, I'd consider this a low risk factor because it doesn't show a pattern of criminal behavior yet.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'1\" and 155 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight. I'm not sure how much physical build impacts recidivism, but maybe being underweight could indicate stress or other issues. I'm not certain about this one, but perhaps it's a low risk factor since it's not directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests he's motivated and has opportunities, which should lower his risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with commitment or behavioral problems. Multiple job changes might suggest he's struggling, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact. Since it's mentioned as past use, maybe it's not a current issue, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four. A stable family environment can be protective. A household size of four isn't too large, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The higher risks are his age and living situation, but education and lack of depression are positives. I think the overall prediction is low for rearrest, so I'll say \"NO\" with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is less concerning than current or heavy use.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable household size can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
