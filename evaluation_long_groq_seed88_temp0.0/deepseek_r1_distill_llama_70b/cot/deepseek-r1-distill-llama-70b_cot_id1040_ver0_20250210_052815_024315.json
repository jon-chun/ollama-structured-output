    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack of stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement, but it's still a risk. I think this is a low factor because the absence of a conviction could mean it wasn't a serious offense or there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending. This seems like a medium factor because living alone can contribute to isolation or lack of supervision.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college points to limited education, which can affect job stability and opportunities. This is a high risk factor because education is a key factor in reducing recidivism.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment is a known risk factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism, so this is high.\n\nFeeling down for parts of the past month could indicate mental health issues, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child might expose her to higher crime environments, so that's a medium factor.\n\nNot considering religion important could mean less of a support system or different coping mechanisms, which I'll rate as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, employment, mental health, and urban upbringing. Low factors are arrest without conviction, physical characteristics, and religious views. The presence of multiple medium and high factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing development and instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which can contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability, having held 3 jobs in a year, suggests potential challenges in maintaining steady employment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce a potential protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
