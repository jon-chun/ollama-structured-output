    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator for recidivism. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really influence criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that might contribute to higher risk. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, so not pursuing higher education might be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of criminal activity. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it's linked to criminal behavior and can lead to reoffending. So, high risk here.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health issues can vary. Since he's not currently depressed, I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, unemployment, and drug use. These likely outweigh the lower factors, so I predict a higher chance of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while the factors are strong, individual circumstances can vary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is in a high-risk age group for recidivism, as younger offenders are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, specifically cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it is often linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support system can increase the risk of recidivism, as it may lead to isolation and lack of accountability.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a biological father may not be as significant a risk factor as other family dynamics, but urban environments can be associated with higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"A lack of religious affiliation has been linked to higher recidivism rates in some studies, as it may reduce social support and moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
