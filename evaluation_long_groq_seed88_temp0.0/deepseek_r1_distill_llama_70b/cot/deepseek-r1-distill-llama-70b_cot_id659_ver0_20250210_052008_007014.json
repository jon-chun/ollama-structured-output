Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests, especially by 21. A high number of prior arrests is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. People with more arrests often have a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and 105 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong predictors of recidivism. So I might rate that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not being married and not living alone might indicate less stable living conditions, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can affect employment opportunities. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her job options, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having consistent work can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to reoffend. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, is a significant risk factor. It can impair judgment and is often linked with criminal behavior. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk related to mental health issues.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, which might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests, unstable employment, and drug use are the most concerning. Her age and living situation add to the risk, but maybe not as much. So I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 85% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not exceptionally high risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"9 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"convictions suggest a pattern of illegal activity\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"holding only 1 job in a year suggests instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"marijuana use in the past four years is a risk factor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma but no college enrollment\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"living with biological mother in a large household in an urban area\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"lack of religious affiliation may indicate lower social support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
