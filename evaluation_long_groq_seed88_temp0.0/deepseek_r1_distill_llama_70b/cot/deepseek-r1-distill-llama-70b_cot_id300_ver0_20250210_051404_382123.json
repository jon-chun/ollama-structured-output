    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stability in their lives. So I'm leaning towards a high risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be extremely high, but having a conviction does indicate some seriousness. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not a very high number of arrests, but the conviction shows that at least one of those arrests led to a more serious outcome.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to me. I don't think physical build has a direct correlation with recidivism, so I'll mark that as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support. I'm considering this a medium risk factor because social isolation can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and has only held one job in the past year. Employment instability is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having steady work can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal behavior. So I'm rating this as high risk.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years and has used them in the past month. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and can be linked to criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced some depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not properly addressed. I'm considering this a medium risk factor because while it's a concern, it's not as directly linked as substance abuse.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Growing up in an urban environment might expose someone to higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal activity, so I'm rating this as medium risk.\n\nHe believes that God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so I'm considering this a low risk factor as it might be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, employment instability, and drug use. Medium factors include conviction history, living alone, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are physical build and religious beliefs. The presence of multiple high and medium risk factors makes me predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while the factors are concerning, there's still a chance for intervention and positive change.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history, but not an extensive one.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Having only held one job in the past year suggests financial instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down recently could indicate unaddressed mental health issues, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a larger household might expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
