    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet stabilized in their lives. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, showing a pattern of repeated offenses. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 190 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. I don't see this as a major factor, so low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective against recidivism. Without these, his risk might be higher, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism by providing better job opportunities. Not being enrolled might limit his options, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased stress. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially recent use, is linked to higher recidivism rates. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, but without more severe symptoms, this is a medium factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, but living with a biological parent is a stabilizing factor. This seems low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, and unstable employment. These outweigh the protective factors. So, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Nine prior arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build is not a significant indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried and living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment history can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use is a risk factor, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate mental health issues that could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in an urban area provides some stability, though urban environments may have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
