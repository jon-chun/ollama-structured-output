    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not be a strong indicator on its own, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 220 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but I don't see a direct correlation between body size and recidivism. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Having steady work, even if it's two jobs, suggests stability, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a big positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so this is definitely low.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health can play a role, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this is a low risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but his stable upbringing might mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors are age, living alone, and education. However, the strong protective factors like employment, no drug use, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs likely outweigh the risks. So I'm predicting a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted suggests limited prior involvement with the criminal justice system, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests stability and responsibility, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"A belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
