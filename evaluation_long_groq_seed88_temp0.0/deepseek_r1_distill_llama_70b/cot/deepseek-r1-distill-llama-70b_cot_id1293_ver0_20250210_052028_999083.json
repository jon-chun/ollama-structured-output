    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This makes me think his criminal history is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It doesn't really contribute to recidivism, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that might mean less support, increasing the risk a bit. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not continuing beyond high school might limit his opportunities, so medium risk here.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So, medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a major risk factor, so not using is a low risk.\n\nHe's been feeling down for a month. Depression can increase the likelihood of negative behaviors, so mental health issues are a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is stabilizing. So, maybe low risk here.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of medium and high factors. His criminal history is the biggest concern. I think he's at medium risk overall, so I'll predict \"YES\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, particularly males, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for an extended period could indicate depression or other mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone and never being married may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
