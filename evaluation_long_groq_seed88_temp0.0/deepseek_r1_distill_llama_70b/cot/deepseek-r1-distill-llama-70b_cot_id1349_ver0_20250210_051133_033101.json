    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger offenders might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might not have stable support systems. That could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a lot for someone her age. Prior offenses and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support, which could increase risk, but it's not a huge factor on its own. Maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability. I'm not sure, but maybe low since she's working.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. That's positive, so low risk for substance abuse or mental health issues leading to recidivism.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally positive. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and conviction are the biggest concerns. Other factors are mixed but lean towards lower risks. So, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't super high because some factors are positive. Maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and potential lack of stable support systems.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Ten prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight are not directly correlated with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marital support may indicate a lack of stable social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and limited employment history can hinder rehabilitation and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use or history of depression suggests lower risk of substance-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing_and_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in an urban area may not significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
