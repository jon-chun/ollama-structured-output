    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of criminal involvement, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor because while it's a concern, it's not multiple offenses.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and between 175-199 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical attributes aren't strong predictors. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might lead to criminal activity. So this is a medium risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it's not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can be a risk factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So this is a low factor.\n\nLiving in a large household (size 8) at a young age. Growing up in a crowded household might indicate less individual attention and possibly a higher stress environment, which can be a risk factor. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and lack of education. Medium factors include conviction history, living alone, unstable employment, drug use, and household size. Low factors are physical attributes, recent mental health, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering these, the high and medium factors suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the presence of protective factors like religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm about 75% confident in predicting a higher risk, so the prediction is YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal involvement but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability and crime.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Large households may indicate less individual support and higher stress.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
