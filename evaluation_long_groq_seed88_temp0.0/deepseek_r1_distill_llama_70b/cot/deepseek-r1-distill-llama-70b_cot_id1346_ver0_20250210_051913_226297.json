    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet stabilized in their lives.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having a prior record, especially multiple arrests, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. Each arrest increases the likelihood that the individual might reoffend.\n\nHis education status is another point. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might push someone towards criminal activities out of necessity or because they don't see other options.\n\nEmployment-wise, he hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, which in turn can drive individuals to commit crimes to make ends meet.\n\nDrug use is present here\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for recidivism. Drugs can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nLiving alone and never being married might indicate a lack of strong social support. Without a stable family structure or support system, individuals are more likely to reoffend because they don't have the same level of accountability or help to stay on track.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which might contribute to recidivism. However, living with his biological mother might provide some stability, so this could be a mixed factor.\n\nHe doesn't feel that God has control over his life. Lack of religious affiliation or belief can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism, but it can also mean less of a support system if he doesn't have other community ties. This one is a bit tricky, but I might lean towards it being a lower risk factor compared to others.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a good indicator here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. Moderate factors include his age and living situation. The lower factors are his mental health and religious beliefs. Overall, these factors lean towards a higher risk of rearrest, so I would predict YES with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing development and stabilization.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and a conviction significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential recidivism due to impaired judgment and illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce certain support systems but isn't a strong risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive indicator reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
