    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, showing a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future offenses, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight, 6'3\" and 208 lbs, might make him stand out, but I don't see this as a direct risk factor. It's more of a physical descriptor without a clear link to recidivism, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which could be a medium risk factor. However, it's not as strong as other factors, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and lack of structure. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so his abstinence lowers his risk here. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe felt down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because it's not severe but could be a concern.\n\nLiving in a household of size four at a young age might not have a direct impact, but larger households can sometimes have more resources, so I don't see this as a significant risk factor. Maybe low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, lowering his risk. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age, prior arrests/convictions, unemployment, and mental health. The protective factors are no drug use and religious beliefs. The prediction leans towards a higher risk, so I'll predict YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma but no current employment increases the risk of recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate underlying mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Living in a larger household at a young age does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
