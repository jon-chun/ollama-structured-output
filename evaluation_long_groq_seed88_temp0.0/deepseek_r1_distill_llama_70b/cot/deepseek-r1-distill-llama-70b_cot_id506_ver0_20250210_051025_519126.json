    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 260 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see a direct correlation between physical size and criminal behavior. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 18 is common. I'm leaning towards low risk here.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing structure and opportunities. This should be a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior due to lack of income and purpose. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common, but it can be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. This is a low risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he has a mix of low, medium, and one high risk factor (unemployment). The high risk from unemployment is significant, but the presence of positive factors like education and family background might mitigate it. I'm predicting a higher chance of rearrest, so prediction is YES. My confidence is around 75% because while there are concerning factors, there are also positive elements that could reduce the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"A history of arrest, even without conviction, suggests some engagement with the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"While physical size might influence interactions, it's not a direct indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is common and doesn't strongly indicate increased risk.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Education provides structure and opportunities, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment can lead to financial instability and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can indicate potential substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depressive symptoms can increase recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"stable family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents provides stability, a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
