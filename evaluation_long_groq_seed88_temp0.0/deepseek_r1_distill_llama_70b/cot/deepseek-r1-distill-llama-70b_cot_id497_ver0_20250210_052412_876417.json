    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean it was a minor offense or a one-time mistake. That seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't impact much. I don't think physical build is a significant factor here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. That sounds like a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not having more than a diploma might limit job opportunities, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is important; having only one job might indicate some instability, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing, can increase the likelihood of recidivism, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. A stable family environment is positive, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, and several mediums. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is low for rearrest, but I'm about 65% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not excessively high risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history and low risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate some instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate ongoing substance use, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate mental health issues that could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may expose to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
