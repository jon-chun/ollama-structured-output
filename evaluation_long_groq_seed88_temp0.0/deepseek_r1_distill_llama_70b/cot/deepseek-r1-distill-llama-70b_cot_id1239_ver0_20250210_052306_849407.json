    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really influence recidivism much, so I'll consider that low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending because he doesn't have a strong support system. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low to medium risk. I'll say low because he does have a diploma.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Having a steady job can reduce the likelihood, so having just one job suggests instability, which is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit or impair judgment. Recent use, even if not constant, still poses a risk, so this is high.\n\nHe's experienced some depression recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other negative behaviors. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in a large household in a rural area. Rural areas might have fewer resources and opportunities, which could contribute to higher risk. Living in a larger household might also have its own challenges, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase risk, but this can vary. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are employment instability and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are age (though it's on the higher side), education, physical build, and religious beliefs. \n\nThe high factors are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are significant risk factors, some mitigating factors like education and no conviction might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"high\", \"Having only one job in the past year suggests instability, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a rural area with a large household may have contributed to environmental risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce social support but is less significant.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
