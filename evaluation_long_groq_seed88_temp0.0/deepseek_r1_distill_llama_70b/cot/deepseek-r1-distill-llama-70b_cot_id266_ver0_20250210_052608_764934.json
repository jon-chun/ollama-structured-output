    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had legal issues before, but it's not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHis height is 5'6\", which is average, so I don't see this as a significant risk factor. It doesn't really influence behavior or recidivism, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might mean less social support, which could increase risk. Living alone could also mean fewer people to provide support or supervision. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal behavior. So, medium risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially illegal drugs, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. However, marijuana is legal in some places, but it's still a drug that can affect judgment. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So, low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor, making it low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is education, mediums are age, employment, arrest history, living situation, and upbringing. Lows are height, mental health, and religion. The high education risk is significant, but the other mediums balance it out. I think the overall prediction is YES for recidivism, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates past legal issues but isn't a repeated pattern.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital support may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits job opportunities, increasing criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can affect judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
