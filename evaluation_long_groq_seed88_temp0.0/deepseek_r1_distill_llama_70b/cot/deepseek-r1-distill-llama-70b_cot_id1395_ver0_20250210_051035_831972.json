    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old woman based on the given information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, might have higher impulsivity, which can sometimes lead to criminal behavior. However, she's not a juvenile anymore, so maybe her age isn't the highest risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men. That might be a positive factor in her case.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction do indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history. I'm not sure if two is considered low or medium. Maybe medium because it's more than one but not multiple.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'3\" and 170 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor in recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes, which isn't mentioned here. So probably low risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor against recidivism. Support from a partner might help her stay on a positive path. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her job opportunities. However, she's held three jobs in the past year, which shows she's employable and maybe has some stability. So maybe medium risk because limited education could affect her future employment, but she's managing so far.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's a strong positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so her sobriety is a good sign. Low risk here.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but she hasn't felt depressed recently. That's another positive. Low risk.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a small household. Stable family background can reduce recidivism risk. Low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which might lower recidivism risk. Low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: she has some medium risk factors like two arrests and limited education, but several low risk factors like stable marriage, employment, no drug use, and positive mental health. So overall, her risk seems lower. I think her prediction for rearrest is NO, and my confidence is around 75% because while there are positives, the criminal history is still a factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 22, while young, she is an adult with potential for maturity.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female, associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse suggests stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED with no college limits opportunities but she's employed.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held three jobs shows employability and stability.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide support and purpose.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
