    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and male. I know that younger males, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So age and gender might be a medium risk factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things. Maybe he's been in situations where he was arrested but not found guilty, or perhaps he's had charges dropped. However, multiple arrests do suggest some level of involvement in activities that lead to police interaction, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor. Physical build isn't typically a major indicator for recidivism unless it's extreme, which it's not here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal behavior. So, this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to dependency, which often correlates with criminal activity to obtain drugs. Recent use, even if not constant, still poses a risk, so I'd rate this high.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of reoffending if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it's not as directly linked as substance abuse or criminal history.\n\nHis family background: living with his biological mother in a small household. A stable family environment can be protective, but since he's living alone now, maybe he doesn't have that support anymore. However, the fact that he did live with his mother might have provided some stability, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor, but I'm not sure how strong it is. Maybe it's a low risk factor or even a protective one, but since the question is about risk factors, I might consider it low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are prior arrests, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, unstable employment, and mental health. Lower factors are family background and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while there are strong indicators, there are also some mitigating factors like religious beliefs and past family stability that might reduce the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially males, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Three arrests without conviction indicate frequent police interaction, suggesting high risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits job opportunities, increasing criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, potentially driving criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depressive feelings can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother provided some stability, though current living alone may reduce support.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
