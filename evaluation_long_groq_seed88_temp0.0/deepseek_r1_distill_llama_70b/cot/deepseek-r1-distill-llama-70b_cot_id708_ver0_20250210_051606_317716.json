    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of behavior that could continue. This seems like a high risk factor because it shows repeated involvement with the law.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 195 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, by itself, physical size isn't a direct indicator of recidivism. So I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and support, which are protective against recidivism. Without these, he might lack such support, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a key factor in reducing recidivism because it provides better job opportunities and personal development. Lack of education is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and income. Having two jobs might indicate some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, but it's better than none. I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a major risk factor, so not using is a low risk factor. However, he's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. Larger households might have more support, but it depends on the environment. Without more info, I'm not sure, so maybe low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which is protective. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are criminal history and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living alone, employment instability, and mental health. Low factors are physical size, household size, and religious beliefs. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher chance of rearrest, maybe 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of legal involvement, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"While physical size might intimidate, it isn't a direct indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital support can indicate instability, which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits opportunities, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having two jobs suggests some instability, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Larger households may offer more support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
