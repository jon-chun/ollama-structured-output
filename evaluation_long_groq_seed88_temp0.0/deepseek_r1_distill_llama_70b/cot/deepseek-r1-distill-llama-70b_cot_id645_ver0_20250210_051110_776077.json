    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and may not have fully developed impulse control. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some level of involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had a brush with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see any particular risk there. That's probably a low factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support. I'm considering this a medium risk because without a support system, he might be more likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to situations where he might reoffend. I think this is a medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This could be a medium risk because job instability can lead to financial stress, which might increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed. This is a medium risk because untreated mental health can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is a low risk. However, urban areas might have higher crime rates, but since he had both parents, it's more positive than negative.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. This is a low risk because it can offer support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a significant concern. The medium factors around age, arrest, living alone, education, employment, and mental health add up. The protective factors like family background and religion help, but the overall picture leans towards a higher risk. So, I predict a YES for rearrest, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, and individuals in this age group are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law, but the lack of conviction may reduce the risk compared to a convicted individual.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some stability, but frequent job changes could indicate instability, which might increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use, especially recent use, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps could indicate underlying mental health issues, which, if untreated, might increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a positive factor, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor that reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
