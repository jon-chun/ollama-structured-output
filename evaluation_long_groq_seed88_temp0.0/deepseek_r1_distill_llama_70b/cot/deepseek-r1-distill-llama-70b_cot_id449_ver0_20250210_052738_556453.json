    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age-related risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because the absence of a conviction might mean it wasn't a serious offense or there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nHis height and weight\u20146'2\" and 170 lbs\u2014don't immediately stand out as risk factors. Unless there's a specific reason related to physicality, this might not be a significant factor. I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might mean less stability, but not living alone could imply he has a support system. This is a bit mixed, but I'll lean towards medium because living with others might provide some stability, but not being married could indicate less life stability.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could be a risk factor. I'll rate this medium because education can impact employment stability.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Two jobs in a year might suggest some instability, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Living with a biological parent is generally positive, but urban environments might have higher crime rates. This could be a medium risk factor because the environment might expose him to more criminal opportunities or influences.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has control over his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but if he feels disconnected, it might not provide the same support. I'll rate this as low because it's not as directly impactful as other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, living situation, education, job instability, and upbringing. The low factors are arrest without conviction, physical build, mental health, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high drug use and several medium factors might push the prediction towards a higher likelihood. However, the absence of a conviction and stable living situation might mitigate some risks. I'm about 65% confident he might reoffend, so the prediction is YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"While an arrest indicates potential criminal activity, the lack of conviction suggests it may not have been a serious offense.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with criminal behavior and are not significant risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and living with others could indicate some instability or lack of strong social bonds.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year could indicate instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator, reducing the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing and environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological parent is positive, but an urban environment may expose him to higher crime influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not provide the same protective factors as active religious engagement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
