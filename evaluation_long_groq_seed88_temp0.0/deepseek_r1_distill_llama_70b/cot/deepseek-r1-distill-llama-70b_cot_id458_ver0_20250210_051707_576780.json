    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a moderate risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior, so I might rate this as a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Being divorced at 20 is unusual and might indicate some instability in her personal life. Living alone could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, potentially leading to situations where she might reoffend. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which could increase the likelihood of criminal activity. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support a habit. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might reduce the likelihood of recidivism. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, and several medium factors like age, arrests, living situation, education, and employment. The protective factors are her mental health and religious beliefs. Considering all these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some mitigating factors. I'll set confidence at 72%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral patterns.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college limits opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial issues.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment exposure to crime.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
