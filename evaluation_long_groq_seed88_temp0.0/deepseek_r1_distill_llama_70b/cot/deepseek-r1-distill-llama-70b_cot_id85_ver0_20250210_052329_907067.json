    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests aren't extremely high, but having a conviction does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some history, but it's not an extensive record.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 155 lbs. That's a bit on the slender side, but I don't see how that directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a strong predictor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. But it's not a strong indicator on its own, so medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit his opportunities, but it's not a high risk. So medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk. So medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's recent. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally positive. So this is low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, and several mediums. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal involvement, though not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest less social support, a potential risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not attending college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests possible instability in employment, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother is generally positive, though urban areas may have higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
