    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without convictions, it's a bit unclear. I might rate this as medium because it shows some risk but not the highest.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I can probably ignore those factors.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor against recidivism because they provide support and structure. This might lower her risk, so I'd rate this as low.\n\nShe has a GED, which is a basic education. Not having higher education could limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity. However, she's held one job in the past year, which shows some stability. Maybe this is a medium risk because while employment is positive, limited education could still pose some challenges.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used cocaine in the past four years, which can lead to dependency and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior to obtain drugs. This is a high-risk factor because substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism.\n\nHer mental health is another concern. She's felt down for most of the past month, which could indicate depression. Untreated mental health issues can increase the risk of reoffending, especially if she turns to drugs as a coping mechanism. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHer upbringing in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of four might not be a significant risk factor on its own. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but she was with her mother, which is a stable family environment. I might rate this as low.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This would be a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are drug use and mental health issues. The medium factors are her arrests without convictions and limited education. The low-risk factors include her stable marriage, employment, upbringing, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high-risk factors are significant, but the protective factors might mitigate them somewhat. However, drug use and mental health are strong predictors, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. But since she has a stable marriage and job, maybe the confidence isn't extremely high. I'll predict YES with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is young but not significantly high risk\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"two arrests without conviction indicate some risk\"),\n    (\"stable marriage\", \"low\", \"married and living with spouse provides stability\"),\n    (\"limited education\", \"medium\", \"GED and no college limits opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"held one job shows some stability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"cocaine use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"depression increases risk\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"stable household with biological mother\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
