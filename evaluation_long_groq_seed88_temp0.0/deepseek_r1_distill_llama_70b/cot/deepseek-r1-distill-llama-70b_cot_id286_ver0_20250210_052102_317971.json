    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and might not have fully developed impulse control. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some level of involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had a brush with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHis physical build is 5'10\" and 180 lbs, which is average. I don't see this as a significant risk factor either way, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 22 isn't unusual, so I'm considering this a low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which lowers his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or transient employment. However, it's better than being unemployed, so I think this is a low risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this isn't a concern. So low risk here.\n\nHis living situation as a child was with non-biological adults in an urban area. Growing up in non-stable family environments can increase risk, and urban areas might have higher crime exposure. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern, but he has several protective factors like education and religious beliefs. The other factors are medium or low. I think the overall prediction is that he won't be rearrested, but I'm about 65% confident because the drug use is a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but is less severe than multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being single at 22 is common and not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Engagement in higher education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held jobs suggests some stability, though frequent changes could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to potential for impaired judgment and criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable family and urban environment may increase exposure to crime.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
