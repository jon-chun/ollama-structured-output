    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 19 times already. That's a significant number, especially by the age of 18. A high number of prior arrests is a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe has a conviction, which means he's already been through the criminal justice system. A prior conviction can lead to a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll mark that as high as well.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really contribute to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can sometimes provide stability and reduce recidivism, so living alone without such support might increase his risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college indicates a lack of education, which can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of returning to criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities. So, this is high.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit and impair judgment. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a low risk factor because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to recidivism, but in this case, it's not a concern.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less access to resources, which might increase risk, but living with his mother could provide some stability. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase risk, so I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his risk factors are high, which makes me lean towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is pretty high, around 85%, because multiple significant factors point towards recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"19 arrests by age 18 indicates a high likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A conviction suggests prior involvement in serious criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a stable relationship may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may increase exposure to criminal influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
