    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested seven times. That's a significant number, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Multiple arrests, especially at a young age, are a strong predictor of future offenses. So this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has a conviction, which means he's been through the criminal justice system, which might not have been a deterrent. Having a conviction is another indicator, so that's medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't see, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can be protective factors against recidivism. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can provide stability and opportunities, so not pursuing higher education might limit his options, increasing the risk. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if it's frequent or combined with other substances, can increase recidivism risk. However, marijuana alone might be less severe than harder drugs, so I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might actually be a protective factor. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five in an urban area. Larger households might have more stress or less supervision, and urban areas can have higher crime rates. This could contribute to higher risk, so medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several medium and high-risk factors, especially the number of arrests and conviction. His age and employment instability also contribute. However, he has some protective factors like education and religious beliefs. Overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"Seven arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having a conviction suggests exposure to the criminal justice system, which may not have been a deterrent.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not appear to be significant risk factors in this context.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe than other drugs, can still contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests a lower risk compared to individuals with current mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing and environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household in an urban area may have exposed him to higher crime rates and less supervision.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
