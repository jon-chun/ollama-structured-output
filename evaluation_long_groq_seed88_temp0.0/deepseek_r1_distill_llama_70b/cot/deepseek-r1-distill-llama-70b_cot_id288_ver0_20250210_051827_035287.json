    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's enrolled in a 4-year college, which suggests she's on a positive path. So, I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor because while young, her education could mitigate that risk.\n\nNext, she's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history. This could be a medium risk factor because it shows some past issues, but not a long-standing pattern.\n\nShe's living alone, which might mean less social support. Without a strong support system, the risk could be higher. I'm leaning towards medium here because while living alone isn't a direct indicator, it can contribute to higher risk if she doesn't have others to help her stay on track.\n\nHer education is a high school diploma and she's in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor as it provides skills and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a low risk factor because it's a positive influence.\n\nEmployment-wise, she's held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is a protective factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. I'm considering this a low risk factor because having any employment is better than none, but frequent job changes could be a concern.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not currently depressed, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child is generally a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but her stable family background might offset that. I'm thinking this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. This could be a low risk factor as it can help her stay on a positive path.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors are her age and criminal history. The rest are low. So, the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are positive factors like education and employment. I'll set confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity but her education may mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal involvement but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs suggests some stability, though frequent changes could be a concern.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, reducing mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background provides protective factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may offer support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
