    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old individual to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested seven times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of behavior that's concerning. Prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors. While being 5'8\" and 240 lbs might make him stand out in certain contexts, there's no direct correlation with criminal behavior, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and a sense of responsibility, which can reduce the likelihood of recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive as it shows he has some level of education. However, he's not enrolled in college and has only held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So employment instability is a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some times in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. However, since it's marijuana and not harder drugs, I might rate this as medium rather than high.\n\nHe's experienced some depression, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other negative behaviors. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing in an urban area with a larger household could contribute to environmental factors that increase risk, such as exposure to crime or limited resources. However, he did live with his biological mother, which provides some stability. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis religious beliefs might provide a sense of purpose and community, which can be protective against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and prior criminal history. The medium factors include employment instability, drug use, mental health, and upbringing. The low factors are his physical build, marriage, education, and religion. The high factors are strong indicators, so despite some protective factors, the prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are significant risk factors, there are also some stabilizing elements in his life that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Seven arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior predictive of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can provide emotional support and responsibility, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"medium\", \"GED is positive, but unstable employment may lead to financial instability and increased criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while concerning, is less severe than harder drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed, potentially leading to negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban, large household may expose to crime, but living with biological mother provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer purpose and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
