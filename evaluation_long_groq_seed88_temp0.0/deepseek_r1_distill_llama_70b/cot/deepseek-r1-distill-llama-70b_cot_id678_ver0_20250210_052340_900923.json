Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or higher impulsivity. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that he's had some involvement with the law, but since there was no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to pose any particular risk. I don't think this is a significant factor, so low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but being unmarried at 22 is pretty common. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a Bachelor's degree, which is a positive factor. Education often reduces recidivism risk because it provides better opportunities. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending due to financial stress. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe it's a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not feeling depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes in God, which can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are his age and job instability, both medium. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is NO for rearrest, with a confidence of 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate substance use issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common at this age and doesn't strongly indicate risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a Bachelor's degree is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
