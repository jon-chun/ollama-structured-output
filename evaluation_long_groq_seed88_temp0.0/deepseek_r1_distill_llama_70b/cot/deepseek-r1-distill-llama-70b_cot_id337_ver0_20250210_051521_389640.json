Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement in criminal activity, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might slightly increase risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor because it provides stability and income, reducing the need for criminal activity. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a big positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence lowers the risk here.\n\nShe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so that's a medium factor.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a stable household. A supportive family environment is a protective factor, so that's low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. While spirituality can be a protective factor for some, the absence of it doesn't necessarily increase risk, so I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are her age and mental health, but the presence of a high school diploma and stable employment are positives. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment provides stability and reduces criminal incentives.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
