    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 195 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, by itself, it's not a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective against recidivism. Living alone without such support might increase his risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a strong protective factor. It suggests he's engaged in positive activities and building a future, which reduces recidivism risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment provides stability and structure, which are positive signs. However, having two jobs might indicate some instability or difficulty maintaining employment, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments might expose him to higher crime rates. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. This is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his criminal history and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, employment stability, and mental health. Protective factors are education, family background, and religion. The high-risk factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, the protective elements like education might mitigate some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes alone are not strong indicators of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without strong social support may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having two jobs may indicate instability, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
