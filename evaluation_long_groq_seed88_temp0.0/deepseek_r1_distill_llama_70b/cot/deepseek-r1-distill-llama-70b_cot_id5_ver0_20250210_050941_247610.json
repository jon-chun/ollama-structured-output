    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where charges didn't stick, or perhaps he's had close calls. However, multiple arrests can still point to a pattern of behavior that's risky. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some engagement with the justice system, even without convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 200-224 lbs. While this might make him stand out in certain contexts, by itself, it's not a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships can sometimes reduce recidivism, so not being married and living alone might increase his risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. However, having some employment is better than none, so I'm leaning towards low risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it all the time in the past month. Drug use, especially frequent, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to impaired judgment and engagement in risky behaviors. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month. Depression or low mood can increase the likelihood of substance abuse or other risky behaviors. Mental health issues are a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and living with a single parent could have its challenges, but having a biological parent present is a positive. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, arrests, living alone, education, and mental health. The low factors are physical build, employment, upbringing, and religious beliefs. The presence of a high-risk factor and several medium ones suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the presence of some stabilizing factors like employment and education might temper that risk a bit. So, I'm predicting a YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors as well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics alone are not strong indicators of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having some employment is positive, though job instability could be a concern.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Frequent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase risky behaviors and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in an urban area has challenges but also support.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support but isn't a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
