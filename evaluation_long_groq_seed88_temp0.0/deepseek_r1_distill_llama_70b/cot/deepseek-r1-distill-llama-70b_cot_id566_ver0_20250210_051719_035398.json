    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger offenders, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, especially by the age of 20. Multiple arrests often indicate a pattern of behavior that's more likely to continue, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHer education level is another point. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might push someone towards criminal activities out of necessity or because they don't see other options. This seems like a medium risk factor because while it's important, it's not as directly linked as criminal history.\n\nEmployment-wise, she's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. I'd rate this as medium as well because it's a contributing factor but not the most critical one.\n\nDrug use is another factor. She's used marijuana in the past four years and some in the past month. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent. However, since it's not a harder drug, maybe the risk is lower. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nMental health is a concern too. She's felt down and couldn't be cheered up sometimes in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHer living situation as a child was with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally more stable. I don't see this as a high risk factor, so maybe low.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a support system or moral framework. This might lower her risk, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the most concerning. The other factors like education, employment, and drug use add to the risk but aren't as severe. Her mental health is a moderate concern. The protective factor of her beliefs might help a bit, but overall, the high-risk factors dominate. So, I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment history can contribute to financial instability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, even if not severe, can still be a risk factor for recidivism, especially if combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed mental health issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate some level of independence, but it can also contribute to isolation, which might be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
