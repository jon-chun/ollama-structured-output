    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because she's at an age where decision-making isn't fully matured yet.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to convictions. I'd rate this as medium because it shows some involvement but not a strong pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but not being married at 18 is pretty common. This might not be a significant factor, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could be a high risk factor. Lack of education often limits job opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or due to fewer opportunities.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, especially if left untreated. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of 10 in an urban area might indicate a higher-risk environment. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide some protective factor, as religion can offer support and reduce recidivism. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education and unemployment. Medium factors include age, arrests without conviction, drug use, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are her living situation, physical attributes, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high factors are significant, but the presence of some protective factors like religion might lower the overall risk. However, the lack of education and employment are strong predictors. So, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest some engagement with the criminal justice system, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while not as severe as harder drugs, can still impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to poor decision-making and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide some stability, though the large household size in an urban area could expose her to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a protective factor against recidivism by offering support and moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
