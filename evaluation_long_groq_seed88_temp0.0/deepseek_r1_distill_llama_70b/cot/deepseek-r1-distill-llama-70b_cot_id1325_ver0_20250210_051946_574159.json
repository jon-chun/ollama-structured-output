    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Hispanic female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism. So I might rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction isn't too high, but it does show some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think that's a low risk factor because it's not a repeated offense.\n\nHer marital status is married and living with her spouse. Being married can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. So I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, potentially increasing stress or instability. I'm leaning towards medium here because while she has a diploma, the lack of further education could be a factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate financial stress or difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to criminal activity. So I'd rate employment history as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence lowers her risk. Definitely a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so being mentally stable is a good sign. Low risk here.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. Having both parents can provide stability, but a large household in an urban setting might have its own challenges, like limited resources or exposure to higher crime areas. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low risk factor because the family support is there despite the large size.\n\nShe believes God influences her personally. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism by offering a support network and moral framework. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of her factors are low risks, with a couple of mediums. Her stable marital situation, lack of drug use, and mental stability are positives. The medium factors like age and job instability are present but not as significant. So I think her overall risk is low, and I'm about 75% confident she won't be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, she is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction suggest limited criminal involvement, indicating a lower risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with her spouse provides stability and support, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which could indicate financial stress.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years significantly lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the likelihood of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents provides stability despite the large household size.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer a support system and moral framework, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
