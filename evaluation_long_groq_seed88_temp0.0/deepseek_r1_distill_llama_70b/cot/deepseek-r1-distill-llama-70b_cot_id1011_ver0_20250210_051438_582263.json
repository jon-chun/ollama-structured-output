    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions, which are stronger predictors. So I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'5\" and 215 lbs. While physical size might intimidate, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I don't see this as a significant risk factor, maybe low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but having a diploma is positive. Not attending college might limit his opportunities, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a job suggests some stability, so this is a low risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common and not as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not depressed now, this is a low risk.\n\nHis living situation as a child with non-biological adults in an urban area could indicate instability or exposure to higher-risk environments, which might increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors are age, living situation, and living alone. But he has protective factors like a job, education, and religious beliefs. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction is a weaker predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job suggests some level of stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in an urban area may indicate exposure to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
