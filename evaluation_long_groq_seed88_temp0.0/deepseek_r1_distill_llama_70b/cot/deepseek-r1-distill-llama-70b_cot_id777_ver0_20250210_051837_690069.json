    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or less stable life circumstances. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions, so I think that's a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to pose any particular risk. I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual. I'm not sure, but maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor; it usually reduces recidivism. So that's definitely a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having two jobs might indicate instability or perhaps she's just trying different things. I'm not certain, but maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to illegal activities or impaired judgment. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Living with a biological parent is generally positive, but urban environments might have higher crime rates. However, since she was in a stable family setting, maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high risk factor is drug use. The rest are mostly low. So her overall prediction for rearrest is probably low, but I'm not super confident because drug use is a strong indicator. Maybe around 65% confidence she won't be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests limited criminal history, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build does not typically correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried at 22 is common and does not significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college indicates stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs suggests some stability, though frequent job changes could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area provides some stability, though urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
