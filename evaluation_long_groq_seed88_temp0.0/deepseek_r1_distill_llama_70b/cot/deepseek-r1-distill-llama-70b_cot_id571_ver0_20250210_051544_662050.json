    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it still indicates some involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had legal issues before, but it's not a repeated pattern.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 210 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, by itself, it's not a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor because it can lead to better job opportunities and more stability. Being enrolled in college suggests he's actively trying to improve his situation, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased stress. This seems like a high risk factor because without a steady income, he might be more tempted to engage in illegal activities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, but since he's been clean for four years, this is a positive sign. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed, but feeling down occasionally isn't as severe as a diagnosed mental illness. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because it could indicate some emotional instability.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of size four when young. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is unemployment, which is significant. The medium factors are his age and mental health, which contribute but aren't as strong. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the overall prediction is that he might reoffend, so the prediction is YES. My confidence is around 65% because while there are some concerning factors like unemployment, there are also positive elements like education and no recent drug use that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, he is in a higher risk demographic for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate some legal involvement but not a repeated pattern.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate emotional instability, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
