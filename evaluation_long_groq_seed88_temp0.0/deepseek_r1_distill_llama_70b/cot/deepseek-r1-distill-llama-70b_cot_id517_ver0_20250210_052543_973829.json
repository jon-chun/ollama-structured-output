    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peers or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. The more interactions someone has with the criminal justice system, the higher the likelihood they might reoffend.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so I'll note that as low impact.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being single and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk, but it's not as strong as other factors.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college is a big one. Education is a key factor in reducing recidivism. Without it, he might struggle to find stable employment, leading to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a protective factor, but job instability (having two jobs in a year) might indicate issues with maintaining employment, which could increase recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use is another major factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially recent use, is a red flag. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\nHe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, as they might lead to self-medication with drugs or other risky behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing with both biological parents in an urban area might have provided some stability, but urban environments can sometimes expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences. However, having both parents could be a protective factor, so this might be a medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might lower recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use. The medium factors include age, living alone, job instability, mental health, and upbringing. The low factors are physical build and religion. The combination of these, especially the high-risk ones, makes me lean towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a significant interaction with the criminal justice system, a strong predictor of future behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment can hinder stable employment, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having two jobs in a year suggests instability, which might contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depression could lead to risky behaviors or substance abuse if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment might expose to higher crime rates, but living with both parents provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer protective factors, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
