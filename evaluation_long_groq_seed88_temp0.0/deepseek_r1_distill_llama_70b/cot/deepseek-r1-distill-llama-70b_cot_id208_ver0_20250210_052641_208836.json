    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, males are more likely to be rearrested, so being female might lower her risk. I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll note that as low.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean she's independent, but it might also indicate a lack of support, which could be a risk. I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk.\n\nHaving five jobs in a year suggests instability, which could be a medium risk factor. Job instability can correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them in the past month. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism, so that's high risk.\n\nShe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so medium risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so that's a medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider religion important. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can reduce recidivism, so not having that might be a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern. The medium factors like living alone, job instability, depression, and urban upbringing add up. However, being female and enrolled in school are positives. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't super high because of the mitigating factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest less severe criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate lack of support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability, a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime exposure, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"lack of religious affiliation\", \"low\", \"Religious affiliation can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
