    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time that might lead to criminal activity. So, I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor because while young, her enrollment could mitigate some risks.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate a lower risk since it didn't result in a guilty verdict. However, the fact that she was arrested at all could suggest some involvement in risky behavior. I'm leaning towards low risk here because the lack of conviction might mean it was a minor offense or a one-time mistake.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 125-149 lbs. These are average and don't particularly stand out as risk factors. Unless there's something specific about her physical appearance that's relevant, which isn't mentioned here, I don't see this as a significant factor. So, low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also mean less social support. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not being married and living alone might slightly increase risk, but it's not a major factor. I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a protective factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing opportunities and structure. This should lower her risk, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity. However, since she's in school, she might be focusing on her education instead of working, which is a positive. Still, unemployment is a known risk factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism, so her abstinence is a positive sign. This should lower her risk, so low.\n\nShe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because it could lead to poor decision-making or further issues if untreated.\n\nHer living situation as a child was with her biological mother in a household of five. A stable family environment with biological parents is generally a protective factor. However, a larger household size might have its own challenges, but overall, this seems more positive than negative. So, low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has control over her life. This could indicate a lack of religious support, which some studies suggest can be a protective factor against recidivism. Without this support, she might have fewer community ties, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk, with a couple of medium ones like age and unemployment. Her mental health is a concern, but the protective factors like education and no drug use are strong. So, I think the overall prediction is low, and I'm about 70% confident in that assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, but being enrolled in school provides structure.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"Arrest indicates potential risk, but no conviction suggests lower severity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, no specific risk indicated.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support but isn't a major risk.\"),\n    (\"enrollment in school\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Joblessness can lead to financial instability, though education may mitigate this.\"),\n    (\"no drug use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence is a strong protective factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression could increase risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"childhood living situation\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious support might reduce community ties.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
