    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement in criminal activity. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows a history, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. It's more of a neutral factor, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might suggest a lack of stable social support. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because it could contribute to instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This could be a medium risk factor because job instability is a concern.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has used them recently. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents as a child, which is generally a positive factor. Stable family environments can reduce risk, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence in his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a strong indicator. The medium factors like age, employment instability, and lack of marriage and education add up. The low factors like stable upbringing and average build don't outweigh the others. So, I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, hence a YES prediction with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, as young adults are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates some involvement in criminal activity, but it's not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and not living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college and having held only two jobs in a year may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age is a stable upbringing, which generally reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious affiliation may have some correlation with recidivism, but it is not a strong predictor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
