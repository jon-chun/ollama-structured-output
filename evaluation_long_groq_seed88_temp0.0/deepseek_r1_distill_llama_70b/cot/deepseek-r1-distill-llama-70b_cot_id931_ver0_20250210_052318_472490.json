    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. This is a high risk factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future recidivism.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'1\" and 135 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical size isn't a significant factor unless it's related to the type of crime, which isn't mentioned here. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment or low employment history can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's part of a pattern that could lead to more serious substance abuse. However, since it's only marijuana and there's no mention of current use or dependence, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, this might actually be a protective factor. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six. A larger household might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which can be a risk factor for delinquency. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are prior convictions and lack of education. Medium factors include young age, living alone, unstable employment, drug use, and household size. Low factors are physical size, recent mental health, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high factors are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are significant risk factors, there are also some protective elements like recent mental health and religious beliefs that might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities and increases risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may have contributed to delinquency.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
