    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making might not be optimal.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does show some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'd rate this as medium because it's a prior offense, but not a repeated pattern.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor. Maybe low risk because there's no indication that his physical stature would contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. However, not being married at 21 isn't unusual, so I'm leaning towards low risk here.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher stress and fewer positive outlets. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk because it's not a strong positive indicator.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Drug use is a major risk factor, so not using is a low risk here.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This could be a medium risk factor because it might lead to poor decision-making or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and community. This would likely be a low risk factor as it can be a positive influence.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education and maybe the urban upbringing. Medium factors include age, prior conviction, mental health, and job instability. Low factors are physical build, living alone, no drug use, and religious beliefs. The prediction is YES because the high and medium factors outweigh the low ones. Confidence is around 75% because while there are several risk factors, there are also some protective elements like no drug use and religious beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is young and may still be developing impulse control, which could influence decision-making.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not a repeated pattern.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs suggests some instability, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression might affect his ability to make positive choices if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose him to higher crime rates and negative influences.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
