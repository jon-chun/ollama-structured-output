    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he's been arrested nine times. That's a significant number, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Multiple arrests, especially this many, are a strong indicator of potential recidivism. So, I'll mark prior arrests as high risk.\n\nHe has a conviction, which means he's been through the criminal justice system and possibly served time. A history of convictions is another strong predictor, so that's high risk as well.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. Physical build isn't typically a major risk factor for recidivism, so I'll consider that low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might suggest a lack of stable social support, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one, but he's not in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism, so not pursuing higher education might be a medium risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment is a key factor in reducing recidivism because it provides stability and income. Having limited employment could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is definitely a high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up with his biological father in an urban area. Having a stable family structure can be protective, but urban environments might have higher crime rates. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor, making it low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are prior arrests, conviction, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, education, and family background. Low factors are physical build, mental health, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high-risk factors are quite strong, so I'm leaning towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while there are several high-risk factors, there are also some protective factors like education and religious beliefs that might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, suggesting a pattern of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted shows involvement in serious criminal activity, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone and being unmarried may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit stability and opportunities, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential continued criminal behavior to support drug habits.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological father in an urban area may have exposed him to higher crime environments, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a protective factor, reducing recidivism risk through social support and personal guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
