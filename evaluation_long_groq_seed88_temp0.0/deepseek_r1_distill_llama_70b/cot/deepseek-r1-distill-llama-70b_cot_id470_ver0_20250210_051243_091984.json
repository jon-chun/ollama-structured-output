    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and might not have fully developed impulse control. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement in criminal activity. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows a history, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 130 lbs. While this might make him less physically intimidating, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can be stabilizing factors. Not being married and living with others might indicate less stability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it might lead to financial instability. Having two jobs in a year isn't too bad, but it's not very stable either. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor, but it's not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can increase the likelihood of recidivism, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a small household in a rural area. A stable family environment can be protective, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is the lack of education, which is significant. The medium factors include age, employment stability, drug use, and living situation. The low factors are his physical build, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high education factor is a strong indicator, but the other factors are mixed. I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are both positive and negative factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Physical stature does not strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital and living status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital stability and living with others may indicate less life stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in a year suggests some instability in employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common factor but not as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with biological dad is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
