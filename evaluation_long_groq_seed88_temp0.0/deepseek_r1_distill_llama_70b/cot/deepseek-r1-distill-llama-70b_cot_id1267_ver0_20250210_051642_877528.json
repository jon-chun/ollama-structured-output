    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis living situation is alone, which could mean less support and more isolation. Living alone, especially at a young age, might contribute to higher risk, so I'll mark that as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year, which indicates instability in employment. Job instability can lead to financial stress, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So, I'll rate employment history as high.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor as it might be linked to other behaviors or addictions that contribute to recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced some depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing was with non-biological adults in an urban area. Growing up in such an environment might expose him to higher crime rates and less stable home life, which could be a risk factor. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a belief in God, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs often provide a support system and moral framework that can reduce recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, education level, and employment history. Medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, drug use, mental health, and upbringing. The only low factor is his religious belief. Considering the balance, the high factors are significant, but there are several medium ones that might mitigate the risk a bit. However, the presence of multiple high-risk factors leans the prediction towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, some mitigating factors like religious belief might help reduce the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate social isolation and lack of support, which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, which can lead to financial stress and increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs, still potentially contributing to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, increasing recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
