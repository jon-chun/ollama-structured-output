    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does show some involvement in criminal activity. I'll mark this as low because it's not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might suggest a lack of stable social structures, which could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism because it provides stability and income. Having two jobs might indicate some instability or difficulty keeping a job, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk here.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a large household as a child. Stable family environments can be protective, so this seems low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the medium factors are age and employment stability, with the rest being low. This makes me think the overall prediction is low, so I'll say NO to rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are some medium factors, the positives like education, employment, and no drug use are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and potential involvement in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate some criminal involvement but does not yet establish a pattern of repeat offending.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year may indicate some instability in employment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not being enrolled in college may limit future opportunities.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and not living alone may indicate a lack of stable social structures, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better mental health, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a stable household suggests a supportive upbringing, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
