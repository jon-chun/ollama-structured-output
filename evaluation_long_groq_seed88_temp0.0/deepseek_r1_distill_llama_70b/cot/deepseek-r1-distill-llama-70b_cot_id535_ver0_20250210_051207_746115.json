    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake. That seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't play a significant role. I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Living with others might provide more stability and support, which is a protective factor. So that's low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a strong positive factor; it suggests she's engaged in productive activities and has better opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. That's definitely a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate some issues, maybe with employment or personal life. That might be a medium risk factor because frequent job changes can sometimes correlate with instability.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and while it's a drug, it's not as strongly associated with recidivism as harder drugs. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Good mental health is a positive sign, so that's low risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so that's low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. That's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The only medium factor is her age and job instability. However, her education and stable upbringing are strong positives. So, I think the overall prediction is low, and I'm about 80% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, but 21 is not extremely young.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests a minor or first-time offense.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build, no significant risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide stability and support.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment indicate positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs in a year could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is common and less associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide purpose and community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
