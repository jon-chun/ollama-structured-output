    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while she's an adult, her age might still contribute to higher risk behavior compared to older individuals.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. This could be a medium risk factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'1\" and 130 lbs. I don't think physical size is a significant factor in recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can be significant risk factors because they often correlate with instability and fewer opportunities, which can lead to criminal behavior. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of four. Having a stable family environment can be protective, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which might reduce recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are unemployment/education and drug use. Medium factors include age, arrests without conviction, and living alone. The rest are low. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. But considering some protective factors like education and religious beliefs, maybe the confidence isn't extremely high. I'll predict YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to medium risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Shows legal involvement but not severe enough for conviction.\"),\n    (\"unemployment/education\", \"high\", \"Lack of job and education can lead to instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide moral support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
