    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and might not have fully developed impulse control. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, which indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, are a strong indicator of potential recidivism. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's particularly relevant here. It doesn't contribute much to the risk assessment, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with family can sometimes provide stability, so not being married and living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which could increase the risk. But I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit and can impair judgment. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is good because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to recidivism. So I'll mark mental health as low.\n\nHis living situation as a child was unstable, living with non-biological adults in a small household in a rural area. Unstable childhood environments can increase the risk of delinquency and later criminal behavior, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support and higher risk, but I'm not sure how strong this factor is. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, unemployment, and drug use. These are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while there are strong factors, some elements like his education and lack of current depression might slightly mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marital support may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"childhood living situation\", \"medium\", \"Unstable living conditions in childhood can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
