    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of criminal behavior, so I'll consider this low.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean instability or lack of support, which might increase the risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might lead to criminal activity. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor, so this is low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good, but mental health can change. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child might expose him to higher crime environments, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis spiritual beliefs, or lack thereof, don't have a clear correlation with criminal behavior, so I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher risk factors are education and employment. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression are positives. I think the prediction leans towards a higher risk, so I'll say YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is not severe.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build is not a strong indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability and increased risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health stability.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of spiritual beliefs does not strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
