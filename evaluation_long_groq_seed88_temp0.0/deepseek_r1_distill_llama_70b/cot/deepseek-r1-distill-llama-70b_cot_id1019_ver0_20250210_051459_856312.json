    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So age could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 147 lbs. His physical build doesn't stand out as particularly strong or weak, so I don't think this is a significant factor. Maybe low.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might mean less supervision or support, which could be a medium risk factor because it might lead to poorer decision-making without guidance.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. Both are positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are known risk factors, so their absence lowers the risk. Both are low.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stable family might offset that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support, acting as a protective factor. So this is low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low, with a couple of mediums. The protective factors like stable upbringing, employment, and no substance abuse are strong. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some involvement but is not highly concerning.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may reduce supervision and support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held jobs suggests stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
