    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a low risk factor because it's a first-time conviction.\n\nHer height is 5'4\", which is average, so I don't see that as a risk factor. It's neutral, so low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and possibly more opportunities to engage in criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor because unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor because it might lead to other behaviors or associate with peers who engage in criminal activities. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not currently depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer living situation as a child was unstable\u2014living with non-biological adults in a large household in an urban area. Unstable childhood environments can contribute to higher recidivism rates because they might expose individuals to more risks early on. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework. So this would be a low risk factor, possibly reducing her likelihood of recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is her unstable childhood, which is significant. The medium factors are her age and unemployment. The rest are low. Considering these, I think her overall risk is medium, but I'm about 65% confident she won't be rearrested because she has some protective factors like education and religious beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate some criminal involvement but is not highly predictive on its own.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but this is not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment status\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but no current employment or college enrollment could increase idle time and opportunities for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is a minor risk factor compared to harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"childhood living situation\", \"high\", \"Unstable living conditions in childhood can increase exposure to criminal influences and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
