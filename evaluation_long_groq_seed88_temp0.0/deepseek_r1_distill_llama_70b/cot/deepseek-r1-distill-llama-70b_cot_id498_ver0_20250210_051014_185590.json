    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some past issues but not a strong criminal history.\n\nHis physical build is 5'10\" and 155 lbs, which is average. I don't see this as a significant factor either way, so low risk.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So I'll mark living situation as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the risk. So medium here.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income. Having two jobs suggests some stability, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common but can be a risk if it leads to other behaviors. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so not feeling depressed is a protective factor. Low risk here.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and limited social support. Medium factors include prior arrest, living situation, education, and drug use. The rest are low. Overall, I think the risk is medium, so a 60% confidence in rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some level of stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a concern but not as severe as harder drugs; however, it can still influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
