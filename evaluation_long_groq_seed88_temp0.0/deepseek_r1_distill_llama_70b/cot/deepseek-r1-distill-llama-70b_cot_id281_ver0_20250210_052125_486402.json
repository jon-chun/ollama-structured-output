    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he was suspected but not found guilty, or perhaps he's had close calls. This could mean he's in environments where legal issues are more common, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't see any indication that his physical build would contribute to recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not being married and living alone could be a medium risk.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can provide stability, but having only one job might indicate some instability or difficulty in maintaining employment. I'm not sure if this is high or medium. Maybe medium because it's not a strong stable history.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, and not using drugs lowers his risk. So this is low.\n\nHe felt down some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five could mean either more support or more stress, depending on the dynamics. I'm not sure, but maybe it's a low risk factor since it's not a clear indicator.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of medium and low factors. His age and living situation are medium risks, but education and no drug use are positives. I think the prediction is NO for rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests without conviction may indicate exposure to high-risk situations or environments.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which may increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability or difficulty in maintaining employment.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing feelings of depression could increase the risk of recidivism if left unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school provides structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no drug use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs in the past four years significantly lowers the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may not necessarily indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
