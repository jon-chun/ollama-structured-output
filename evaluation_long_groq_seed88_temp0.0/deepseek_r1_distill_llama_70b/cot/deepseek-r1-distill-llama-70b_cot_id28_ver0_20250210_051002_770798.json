    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old woman over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that might continue, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some instability or lack of support, which could contribute to higher risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So, I'll rate this as high.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit or impair judgment. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can change, so I'll note this as low for now.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area is generally a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. So, this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like age, job instability, and drug use. However, she also has some protective factors like stable upbringing and religious beliefs. The prediction is that she might reoffend, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the mitigating factors. So, I'll predict YES with a confidence of 65.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral patterns, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate instability or lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes can indicate instability, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor due to potential for impaired judgment and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background with both biological parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
