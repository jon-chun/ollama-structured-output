    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 4 inches. I don't recall height being a significant factor in recidivism. It might be more relevant in specific contexts, but generally, it's not a major predictor. So, I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Being single and living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nHe's enrolled in school. Education is usually a protective factor. It suggests he's engaged in a positive activity that can reduce the likelihood of recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Moving through multiple jobs quickly might suggest instability or behavioral issues, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to further criminal behavior, either through drug-seeking activities or impaired judgment. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and unable to be cheered up. This indicates possible mental health issues, like depression. Mental health struggles can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. Household size might relate to family support. A larger household might offer more support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'm not sure about this one, but maybe it's a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community. This might reduce the risk, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, job instability, and mental health issues. The low factors are age, height, education, household size, and religious beliefs. \n\nThe presence of a high-risk factor like drug use is concerning, but he's also in school, which is positive. The combination of these factors makes me think there's a moderate risk, but I'm not overly confident. I'll predict a YES for rearrest but with a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old, while young, is not in the highest risk bracket for recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior arrest\", \"medium\", \"one prior arrest without conviction indicates some criminal involvement but not extensive\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"height is not a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"never married and living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"enrolled in school, which is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"four jobs in a year suggests instability, a known risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"past drug use, especially cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"periods of feeling down could indicate unaddressed mental health issues\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"household size of four is not indicative of neglect or overcrowding\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs can be a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
