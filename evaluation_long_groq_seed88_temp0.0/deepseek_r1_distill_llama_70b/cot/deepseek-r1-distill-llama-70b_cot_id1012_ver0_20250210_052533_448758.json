    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't the highest risk, but it does show some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'd say that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't play a significant role. I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk, but not being married at 21 isn't unusual. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. That seems high.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and poor life choices. Definitely a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a big one. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has used some in the past month. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so that's high.\n\nShe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending, especially if untreated. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. Maybe medium.\n\nShe believes in God, which can be a protective factor, providing support and reducing recidivism. So that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like unemployment, lack of education, and drug use. These are strong predictors. However, her belief in God might help lower the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment in the past year is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a biological mother is a neutral to moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide protective support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
