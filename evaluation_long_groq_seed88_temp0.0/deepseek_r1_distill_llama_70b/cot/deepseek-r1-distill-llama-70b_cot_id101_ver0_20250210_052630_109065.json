    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 190 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see a direct correlation between physical size and recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can be stabilizing factors, so not being married and living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but having only a high school diploma without further education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this might lower the risk a bit. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of size three. A stable family environment can reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his criminal history and drug use. The medium factors include his age, living situation, education, and employment. The low factors are his physical size, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high-risk factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some mitigating factors like education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential involvement in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical size and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of strong social support may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having only a high school diploma might limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs may indicate instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
