    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. Each prior arrest increases the likelihood, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor here. I don't think physical build is a major contributor to recidivism unless it's extreme, which it's not in this case.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective factors. Without them, he might be at higher risk, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college limits his employment opportunities. Education is a key factor in reducing recidivism because it can lead to better job prospects and stability. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year, which suggests instability in employment. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor as it can be associated with other risky behaviors. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I might rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so the absence of recent depression is a lower risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a household size of four with his biological mother. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might increase risk. Household size isn't too large, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a lower risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his criminal history and lack of education. Medium factors include employment instability, drug use, living situation, and upbringing. Protective factors are his religious beliefs and lack of recent depression. Overall, these factors lean towards a higher risk, so I predict YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits job prospects, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs in a year suggest instability, which can lead to financial stress and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"No marriage or living alone may reduce stability and support.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment might expose to higher crime rates and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
