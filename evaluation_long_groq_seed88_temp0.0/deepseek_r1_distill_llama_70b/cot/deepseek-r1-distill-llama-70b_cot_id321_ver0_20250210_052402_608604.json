    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions, so I think that's a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose a risk. That's low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk a bit, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So that's medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive signs. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so not using drugs lowers the risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces that risk. Both of these are low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a large household might have its own stressors, but living with a biological parent is a stabilizing factor. I'm not sure how much this contributes, so maybe low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which is a protective factor. So that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are his age and job instability, both medium. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is NO for rearrest, with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction is a lower risk factor compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but it's not a strong risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not pursuing further education could limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year may indicate instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering the risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in a large household in an urban area has mixed implications but is not a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide stability and purpose, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
