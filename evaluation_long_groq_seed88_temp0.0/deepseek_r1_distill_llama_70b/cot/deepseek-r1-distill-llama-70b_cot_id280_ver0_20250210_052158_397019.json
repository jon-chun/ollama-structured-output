    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. Multiple arrests could indicate a pattern of behavior, so that's probably a high risk factor. However, no convictions might mean he's either not committing serious offenses or is getting off, which could lower the risk a bit, but I think the high number of arrests still points to high risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 170 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor here, so that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Not being married could also indicate instability, so I'll rate that medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is another risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, so that's medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive factors. Substance abuse is a major risk, so not using drugs lowers the risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces the mental health risk, so both of these are low.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background is a protective factor, so that's low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the family stability probably outweighs that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are prior arrests and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living alone, and unstable employment. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because there are some positive factors too. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Six prior arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to future legal issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which may increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
