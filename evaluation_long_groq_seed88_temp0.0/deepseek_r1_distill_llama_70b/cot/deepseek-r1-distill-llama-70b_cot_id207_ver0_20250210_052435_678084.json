    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so gender here is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement in criminal activity, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll note that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability; being single and not living alone might mean she has a support system, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could be a significant factor. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and stability. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with maintaining steady employment, which is a risk for recidivism. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so her abstinence lowers her risk here, making this a low factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is a medium factor.\n\nGrowing up in a small household (size 2) might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk, but it's not as significant as other factors. I'll consider this low.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence in her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social support, but this isn't a strong indicator, so low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is education, medium factors are age, job instability, and mental health, and the rest are low. The high education factor is significant, but the others are manageable. So overall, I predict a lower likelihood of rearrest, so prediction is NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being single and not living alone may indicate a support system.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet needs increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Small household size may have less supervision or support.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
