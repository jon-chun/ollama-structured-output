    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and might be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 17 times and has a conviction. That's a lot of arrests at a young age, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior criminal history is a strong predictor, so this is definitely high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor. Maybe low risk because it doesn't particularly stand out as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might mean less stability. Living alone could also mean less social support, so I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which is linked to higher recidivism. So, medium risk here.\n\nDrug use is significant. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them all the time in the past month. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so this is high.\n\nHis mental health is a concern. He's felt down for the past month, which could indicate depression. Untreated mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium risk.\n\nHe grew up in a large household with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could be stabilizing. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means less social support, but it's not as strong as other factors. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his factors are high or medium. His criminal history, drug use, lack of education, and mental health issues are significant. So, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while most factors point to high risk, some like living situation and religious views are less clear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"17 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, not a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital stability may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent and frequent drug use is a major risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms could increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment might have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Less social support without religious affiliation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
