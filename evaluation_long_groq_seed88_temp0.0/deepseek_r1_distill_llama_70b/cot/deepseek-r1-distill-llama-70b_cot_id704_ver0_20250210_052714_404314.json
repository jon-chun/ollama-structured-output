    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own.\n\nShe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a lot for someone so young. Prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism because they indicate a pattern of behavior. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 125-149 lbs. I don't think physical size is a significant factor here unless it's related to the type of crime, which isn't mentioned. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not living alone might mean she has a support system, but if she's in an unstable environment, it could be a risk. I'm leaning towards medium here because it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities and stability. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and income. Having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk. I'm thinking medium risk here.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a major risk factor, so her abstinence lowers this risk. However, she's been feeling down lately. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological dad in a large household in a rural area. A stable family environment is positive, but rural areas might have less access to resources. This could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the biggest concerns. Other factors like education and mental health are moderate. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 19, while young, age alone isn't a strong predictor without other factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a significant pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism unless crime-related.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital status may indicate instability or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED can limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs suggest possible instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence for four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with biological parent is positive.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
