    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some criminal history, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive record. I think this is a medium risk factor because while it's a concern, it's not multiple offenses.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'3\" and 190 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living alone can sometimes correlate with less social support, which might increase recidivism risk. However, being single isn't a strong indicator on its own, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Moving through multiple jobs quickly might suggest he's struggling to maintain steady employment, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. Recent use, even if not frequent, still poses a risk, so I'll rate this high.\n\nHe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not properly addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other negative behaviors. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might contribute to recidivism. However, living with his biological mother might provide some stability, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use. Medium factors include prior conviction, education level, job instability, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are physical size, marital status, living situation, and religious beliefs. The presence of multiple medium and high factors suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism, so I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal history but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"Size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being single isn't a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest potential struggles with maintaining steady employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depression could lead to negative behaviors if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment might contribute to higher crime exposure, but living with mother provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
