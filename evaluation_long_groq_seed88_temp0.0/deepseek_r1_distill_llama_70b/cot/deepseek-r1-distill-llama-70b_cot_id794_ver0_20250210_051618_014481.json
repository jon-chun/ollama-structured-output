    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests for someone so young. A high number of prior arrests is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. People with multiple arrests often have a pattern of behavior that's hard to break, so this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 170 lbs. I don't think physical build has much to do with recidivism, so this might be a low-risk factor or not relevant at all.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence behavior. Being unmarried and not living alone might mean less stability or fewer responsibilities, which could contribute to higher risk. I'm leaning towards medium here because it's not as direct as other factors but still relevant.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can impact employment opportunities. Without higher education, job prospects might be limited, which could lead to higher recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might indicate difficulty maintaining steady work, which can lead to financial instability and possibly criminal activity. So, this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if it's frequent, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So, this could be a low-risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which would lower the risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stable family part is more influential, so this is probably a low-risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is likely a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions is a major red flag. The employment instability and drug use add to the risk, but the stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some of that. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and my confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 20 years old, while young, age alone isn't a strong predictor without other factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a pattern of illegal activities likely to continue.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year may indicate instability, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe than other drugs, can still influence behavior and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate a lack of stability or support system.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents provides a stable upbringing, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
