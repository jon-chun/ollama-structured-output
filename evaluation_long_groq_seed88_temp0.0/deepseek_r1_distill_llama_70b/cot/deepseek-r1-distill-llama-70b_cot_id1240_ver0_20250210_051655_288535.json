    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but perhaps not to the point of being found guilty. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that's concerning. I'd rate this as a medium risk factor because it shows some engagement with the legal system, but without convictions, it's not as severe as it could be.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't contribute much to the risk assessment, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Without a stable family structure, individuals might have fewer resources to help them stay out of trouble. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so lacking it could increase the risk. This is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and provide more opportunities for criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to dependency, which in turn can drive criminal behavior to obtain drugs. Recent use, even if not frequent, still poses a risk. I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe's felt down and depressed in the past month. Mental health issues, especially untreated ones, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including criminal activity. This is a medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it's not as directly linked as some other factors.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in a large household in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources and support systems. Living in a larger household could mean less individual attention, but I'm not sure how significant this is. I'll consider it a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but if it means he doesn't have a support system from a religious community, it might be a low risk factor. However, this can vary widely among individuals, so I'm not too certain about this one. I'll mark it as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education level and unemployment, both of which are strong predictors. Drug use is another high factor. The medium factors include age, arrests, living alone, and mental health. The low factors are physical build, upbringing, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high risk factors are quite significant. However, the lack of convictions and some lower risk factors might balance it a bit. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some mitigating factors. Maybe around 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to dependency and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health issues\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or criminal behavior if left untreated.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"While living in a rural area with a large household may have some challenges, it is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support, but its impact on recidivism is less direct.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
