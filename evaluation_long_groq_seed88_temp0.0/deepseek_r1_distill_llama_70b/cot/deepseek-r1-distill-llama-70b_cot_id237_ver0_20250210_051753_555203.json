    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So age could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but perhaps hasn't committed more serious offenses, or maybe he's had close calls. The number of arrests could suggest a pattern, so I might rate this as medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't think physical build is a major contributor here, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism, so this could be a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities and stability, which are protective against recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be protective, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a medium risk. However, having some employment is better than none, so maybe it's on the lower side.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a significant risk factor, so not using is a low risk. However, he's felt down recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size four. Stable family environment as a child is protective, so this is a low risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means less social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education. Medium risks include age, arrests, living alone, employment instability, and mental health. Low risks are physical build, stable upbringing, and religious views. The high education factor is significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk prediction. But since he hasn't been convicted and has stable employment history, maybe the confidence isn't too high. I'll predict YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED can limit job opportunities and stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year may indicate instability, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps could indicate underlying mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
