    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily guilty, or perhaps he's had close calls. However, multiple arrests can still point to a pattern of behavior that's risky, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 149 lbs. That's a bit underweight for his height, but I don't see a direct correlation between physical build and recidivism. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal behavior out of necessity or boredom. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So this is high.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a major risk factor, but since he's abstained, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism if not addressed. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a large household with his biological mother. A stable family structure can be protective, so this is low.\n\nHe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, reducing recidivism. So this is low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, lack of education, and unemployment. Medium factors include living alone, mental health, and prior arrests. Low factors are physical build, drug abstinence, family background, and religion. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also protective elements like no drug use and religious beliefs that might mitigate some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues, though lack of convictions may indicate other factors at play.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate limited social support, which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between physical build and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug abstinence\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background with biological mother is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral framework and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
