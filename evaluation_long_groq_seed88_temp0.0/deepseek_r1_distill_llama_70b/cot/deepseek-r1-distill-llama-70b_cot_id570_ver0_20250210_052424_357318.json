    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be too high, but having a conviction shows that he's had more serious involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not an extensive criminal history, but it's still a concern.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. It's probably a low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not continuing to college might limit his opportunities. This could be a medium risk factor because it shows some education but not higher, which might affect his employability.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having a steady job can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal activity. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to relapse and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but the family stability is a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are employment instability and drug use. Medium factors include age, criminal history, living alone, and education. The rest are low. So overall, I think he's at risk, but I'm about 65% confident because while there are significant risks, there are also some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and potential involvement in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator of mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
