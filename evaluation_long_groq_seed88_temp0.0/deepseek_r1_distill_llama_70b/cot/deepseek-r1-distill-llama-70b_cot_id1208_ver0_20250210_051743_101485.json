    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of stable social support, which might contribute to higher risk. However, living alone at 18 isn't uncommon, so maybe medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some stability and employment history. This could be a protective factor, so I'll rate employment as low risk.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a concern. Drug use can be linked to criminal behavior, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll consider it a medium risk factor.\n\nFeeling down in the past month could indicate mental health issues, which if unaddressed, might increase recidivism risk. However, it's a single factor, so maybe medium.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child might expose him to higher crime environments, but urban upbringing alone isn't a direct risk factor. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHis religious beliefs might provide a support system, which can be a protective factor. So, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and education, mediums are arrest history, living situation, drug use, and mental health. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest indicates some criminal involvement but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Limited education can reduce opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held jobs suggests some stability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could affect behavior if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban environment exposure but not a direct risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
