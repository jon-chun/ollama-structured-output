    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'd rate this as medium because it shows she's had legal issues before, but it's not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 120 lbs. Physical build isn't typically a strong indicator for recidivism, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not being married might mean less social support, and not living alone could indicate she's still dependent on others, which might be a medium risk factor as instability can contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, but since she hasn't used any recently, this is a low risk factor. However, she's been feeling down for the past month, which could indicate depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might be a medium risk factor. However, living with her biological mother in a stable household might mitigate some risks, so maybe this is low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might be a low risk factor, but it's not as significant as other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are her lack of education and employment instability. Medium factors include her age, single conviction, living situation, mental health, and urban upbringing. Low factors are her physical build, drug abstinence, and religious views.\n\nConsidering all these, her overall risk seems moderate. She has some significant risk factors like education and employment, but also some protective factors like no recent drug use. So, I'll predict a YES for recidivism but with a confidence level around 65% because while there are concerning factors, they aren't overwhelmingly high across the board.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal involvement but not a pattern.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability can lead to financial stress and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable living conditions may contribute to instability.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban environment but stable household may mitigate risks.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
