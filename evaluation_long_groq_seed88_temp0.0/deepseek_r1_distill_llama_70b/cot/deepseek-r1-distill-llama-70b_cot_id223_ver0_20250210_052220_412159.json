    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 160 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong predictors of recidivism, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should lower his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Having two jobs might indicate responsibility, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to obtain drugs or while under the influence. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this might be a low risk factor. However, if he had a history of depression, that could be different, but the info given doesn't indicate that.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Living in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal activity, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is significant. The medium factors are prior arrest, living alone, and urban upbringing. The low factors are age, education, employment, mental health, and religion. The high drug use is a strong indicator, but the protective factors like education and employment might balance it out. So I'm leaning towards a lower confidence in predicting rearrest, maybe around 40%. The prediction would be NO because the protective factors might outweigh the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 20 years old, while young, this is not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some risk but not a strong pattern.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college is a protective factor, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs indicates stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime opportunities.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective, stabilizing influence.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
