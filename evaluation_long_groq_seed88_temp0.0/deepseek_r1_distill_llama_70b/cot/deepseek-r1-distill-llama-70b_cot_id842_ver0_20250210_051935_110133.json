    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more prone to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, which could suggest a pattern. However, it's not an extensive history, so maybe this isn't the highest risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 145 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor here. It doesn't really correlate strongly with recidivism, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often provide stability and reduce recidivism, so not being married and living alone could be a medium risk.\n\nHe's enrolled in school. Education is a protective factor. Being in school can provide structure, reduce idle time, and offer better future opportunities, which are known to lower recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment is another protective factor. Having a job can reduce the likelihood of reoffending by providing income and structure. However, only having one job might indicate instability, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit and impairs judgment. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is low.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a small household. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up with both parents can provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so this is low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. This is low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are drug use and maybe the living situation. The protective factors are education, job, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. The prediction is that he might reoffend, but I'm about 65% confident because while there are risk factors, there are also strong protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction suggest some criminal involvement but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school provides structure and opportunities, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job indicates some stability but may suggest instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide purpose and community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
