    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but combined with other factors, it might influence the prediction.\n\nHe's been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, like in Example #6 and #25, led to \"YES\" outcomes. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and between 175-199 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to be significant predictors on their own, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In some examples, living alone was associated with higher risk, like in Example #6. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education was a factor in several \"YES\" cases, like Example #6 and #25. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment was a factor in Example #10 and #29, which were \"YES\" outcomes. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use with marijuana. Many examples with drug use, especially multiple drugs, led to \"YES\" outcomes, but marijuana alone was sometimes in \"NO\" cases. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nFelt down some of the past month. Depression or low mood was present in some \"YES\" cases, like Example #10 and #29. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environment was in several \"YES\" cases, so maybe a medium risk.\n\nDoesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, like #10 and #29, this was a factor in \"YES\" outcomes. So medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are arrest history, lack of education, and unemployment. Medium factors include living alone, drug use, depression, urban upbringing, and lack of religious influence. The low factor is his physical build. The combination of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism. Comparing to examples, cases with similar factors often resulted in \"YES\". So I'll predict \"YES\" with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a range where recidivism is possible but not strongly indicative on its own.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Held no jobs during the year, indicating instability and potential for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but not as severe as other drugs in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area may contribute to higher risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might reduce social support, increasing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
