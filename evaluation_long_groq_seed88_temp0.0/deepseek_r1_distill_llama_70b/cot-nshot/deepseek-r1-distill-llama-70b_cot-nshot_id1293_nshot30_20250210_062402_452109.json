    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, like in example 6 and 19, led to YES outcomes. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 152 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between physical size and recidivism in the examples, so this might be low risk.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. In the examples, living alone or not didn't seem to be a major factor, but maybe living with others could provide some support, so perhaps medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma might lower risk, but not being enrolled could mean less stability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but only having one job might indicate instability, so medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive factor, as drug use is often linked to higher recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nHe's been feeling depressed all the time recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a small household in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could be supportive. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his arrest history and depression. The medium factors include age, living situation, education, and urban upbringing. The low factors are physical size, no drug use, and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors might outweigh the others, leading me to predict a YES, but I'm not extremely confident because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age group but not extremely young\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and conviction indicate a significant criminal history\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"no clear correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone may provide some support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma is positive, but no college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"1 job suggests some instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"no drug use is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"severe depression increases risk\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"urban area but living with biological mother\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs may reduce risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
