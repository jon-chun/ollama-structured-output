    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old mixed-race female and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But I'm not sure how significant age is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most cases are male, but some females had outcomes of both YES and NO. Gender alone might not be a strong indicator, so maybe low risk.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, often led to higher recidivism. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant, so low risk.\n\nLiving alone: Some examples showed living alone as a factor, possibly indicating instability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED: This is a significant factor. Many examples with no diploma had higher recidivism. High risk.\n\nNot enrolled in college: Similar to no diploma, lack of education might be a risk. Medium to high, but maybe medium since she's not enrolled but might have other opportunities.\n\nHeld one job in the past year: Employment can reduce recidivism. Having a job might lower risk, but only one job could indicate instability. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use (marijuana): Drug use is a common factor in recidivism. Even though it's only marijuana, it's still a risk. Medium to high, but maybe medium since it's not harder drugs.\n\nNo depression: This is a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nLiving in a household of size 6 as a child: Larger households might indicate instability or neglect. Medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life: In some examples, this was protective. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are arrest/conviction history and lack of education. Medium factors include living alone, employment instability, drug use, and household size. Protective factors are gender, no depression, and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors might outweigh the protective ones, leading to a prediction of YES, but I'm not very confident because some factors are mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate instability or lack of support, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism as it limits employment opportunities and social mobility.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests some instability in employment, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but still indicates substance use, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of recidivism compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"household size during youth\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger household (size 6) may indicate instability or overcrowding, which can contribute to delinquency.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with personal events may provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
