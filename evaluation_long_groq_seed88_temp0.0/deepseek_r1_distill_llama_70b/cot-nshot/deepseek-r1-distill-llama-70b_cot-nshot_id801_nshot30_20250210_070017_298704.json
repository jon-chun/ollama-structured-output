    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but it's a factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction didn't always lead to a YES outcome, but multiple arrests did. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 220 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between size and recidivism in the examples, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was present in some YES cases, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor; not being enrolled might slightly increase risk, so medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having multiple jobs might lower his risk. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor. This seems high.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, so low.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was a factor, but it's not clear. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high drug use is a strong indicator. However, his employment and stable upbringing might mitigate that. The examples show that even with some positives, high drug use often leads to YES. But in this case, I'm a bit uncertain because of the mitigating factors. I'll predict YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate but not high.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest with conviction shows some criminal history but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between size and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate instability but isn't definitive.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is positive, but not being enrolled might indicate lack of engagement.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs suggests stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk but isn't the strongest factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing lowers risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might slightly increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
