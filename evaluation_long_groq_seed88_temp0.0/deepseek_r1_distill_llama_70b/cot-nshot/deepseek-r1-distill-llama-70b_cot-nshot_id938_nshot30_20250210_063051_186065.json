    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, I saw that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, might have a higher risk because they might still be in a phase where they're more likely to engage in risky behaviors. But 22 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he's been arrested five times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, seem to correlate with a higher likelihood of recidivism. For instance, Example #6 had 7 arrests and a conviction, leading to a YES. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 165 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between physical build and recidivism in the examples, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. In the examples, living alone didn't seem to be a major factor, but being unmarried might indicate less stability, which could be a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Many examples with lower education had higher recidivism, so this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having multiple jobs might indicate instability, but it's better than having none. Maybe this is a medium risk because frequent job changes could suggest instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple substances, was a risk in the examples. Since he's only used marijuana, it's a medium risk compared to harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues, like depression, were a risk in some examples. Since he's not feeling depressed, this might lower the risk, so low.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower recidivism, so this might be a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his arrest history and lack of education. Medium factors include his age, employment instability, and living situation. Lower factors are his beliefs and mental state. So, I think he's at a medium-high risk, but considering the examples, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young but not extremely high risk\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"holding 3 jobs suggests some instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone may indicate some social support\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"no recent depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"urban environment may pose challenges\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide stabilizing influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
