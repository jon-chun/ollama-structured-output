    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but it's a low risk factor because he's not a juvenile anymore.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction often led to a \"NO\" outcome, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'5\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him stand out, in the examples, physical size didn't seem to correlate strongly with recidivism. So, I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was sometimes associated with higher risk, but in many cases, it didn't lead to rearrest. So, medium risk here because it could indicate isolation or instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, so this is low risk.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate instability. So, medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was a common factor in many examples, often leading to higher risk. So, medium risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable upbringing can increase risk, so medium here.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are the single job and living alone, but the lack of conviction and stable education are positives. I think the risk is on the lower side, so I'll predict \"NO\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate, but not excessively high.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability but limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can indicate potential substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults could indicate instability in early life.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
