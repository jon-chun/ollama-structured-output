    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, might have a higher risk because they're still developing and might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure if 18 is considered high risk. Maybe medium.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, seem to correlate with higher recidivism. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'8\" and between 200-224 lbs. I don't recall weight or height being significant in the examples, so maybe this is a low-risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a medium risk factor. Not being married at 18 is common, so maybe that's not as significant.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems high because without education, job prospects are limited, which can lead to criminal activity.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment can be a protective factor, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. In the examples, drug use, especially multiple substances, was a significant risk factor. This is probably high.\n\nShe's felt depressed most of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living conditions can contribute to higher risk, so medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. In some examples, religious beliefs were a protective factor, so maybe low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, drug use, and mental health issues. However, she's also held multiple jobs, which might reduce the risk a bit. The examples showed that multiple high-risk factors often led to a YES prediction, but sometimes other factors could lower the confidence. I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not 100% confident because of the employment factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, but 18 is on the cusp of adulthood.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 2 times and convicted\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation with recidivism observed in examples.\"),\n    (\"Living alone, never married\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"Employment can be protective, but frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Felt depressed most of the past month\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"Lived with non-biological adults in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Unstable living conditions can contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences her life\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
