    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males, seem to have a higher risk. But I'm not sure how significant age is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests and a conviction. In the examples, higher arrest numbers often correlated with a higher risk, like example #6 where 7 arrests led to a YES. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 240 lbs. That's quite heavy for his height, which might indicate health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties to recidivism. Maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. In the examples, being married and living with a spouse sometimes lowered the risk, like example #11 where the outcome was NO. So this might be a protective factor, low risk.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one, but not as good as a high school diploma. In some examples, having a GED didn't necessarily prevent recidivism, but it's better than nothing. Maybe medium risk.\n\nNot enrolled in college. Several examples showed that not being enrolled could be a risk, but it's not as bad as having no diploma. Maybe medium.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but only having one job might indicate instability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years. Many examples had drug use, and it sometimes correlated with higher risk, especially if combined with other factors. So medium risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, lowering risk. So maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and conviction are the biggest red flags. His marriage and belief in God might help, but the criminal history is significant. I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, but not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can be a stabilizing factor, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is better than no diploma, but not as protective as a high school diploma or college enrollment.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held 1 job suggests some stability but may indicate instability compared to more consistent employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can contribute to recidivism, especially with other factors.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed can increase recidivism risk by impairing judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
