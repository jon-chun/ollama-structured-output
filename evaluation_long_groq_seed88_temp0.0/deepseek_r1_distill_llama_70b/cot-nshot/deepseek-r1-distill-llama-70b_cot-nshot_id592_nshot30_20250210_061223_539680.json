    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have a higher risk. But 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators. For instance, Example #6 had 7 arrests and a conviction, leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 145 lbs. This is on the lower side, but I don't see a strong correlation in the examples between physique and recidivism. Maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone didn't seem to be a major factor, but being unmarried might indicate less stability. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower education is a risk, as seen in some examples where lack of diploma correlated with higher recidivism. So medium risk.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor. Many examples with no jobs had higher recidivism, so this is high risk.\n\nDrug use with cocaine is a big red flag. Cocaine use was present in several cases that resulted in YES outcomes. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's a positive, so low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in an urban area. Urban environment might have higher crime exposure, but living with a biological parent could be stabilizing. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was linked to higher risk, so medium.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are arrests/convictions and unemployment. Medium factors include age, living situation, education, urban environment, and lack of religious influence. Low factors are physique and no depression. The high factors are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but not with the highest confidence because some factors are medium or low. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Below-average physique is not strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marriage may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but no college enrollment is a moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year suggests instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation at young age\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence could correlate with higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
