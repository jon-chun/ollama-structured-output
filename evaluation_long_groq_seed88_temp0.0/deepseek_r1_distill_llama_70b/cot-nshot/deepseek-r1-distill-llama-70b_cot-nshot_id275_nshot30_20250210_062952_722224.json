    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those with higher arrest counts, seem to have a higher risk. But age alone isn't the biggest factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested 19 times and has been convicted. That's a lot. In the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially when convicted, often led to a YES outcome. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 185 lbs. Looking at the examples, physical build didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme, which this isn't. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, but not always. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor; lack of it increases recidivism risk. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. High risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. The examples showed that multiple drug use, especially harder drugs, increased risk. This is high.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk, but the absence might lower it a bit. So low here.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so this might be a medium factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. In some examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower recidivism, so this could be a medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors like multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use are strong indicators. Despite some lower factors, the overall prediction leans towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is a young age, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not the most significant factor.\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"19 arrests indicate a high likelihood of recidivism as frequent arrests are a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction status\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a history of serious offenses and a higher probability of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it limits employment opportunities and social integration.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Held no jobs during the year indicates instability and lack of social ties, which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine) increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity to support drug habits.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, which can contribute to recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a biological mother in a household of size 4 may have exposed him to higher crime environments, but the impact is moderate.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with personal events may reduce a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 92\n}\n```",
