    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, I saw that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, might have a higher risk, but 22 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests and a conviction. In the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, often led to a YES outcome. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 190 lbs. Looking at the examples, size didn't seem to be a major factor unless it was extreme. This seems average, so low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, maybe due to less social support. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than nothing, but not being enrolled might limit his opportunities, so medium risk.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor. Having only one job might indicate instability, so medium.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple substances, was a high risk in examples. Even though it's only marijuana, it's still a risk. Medium, maybe, since it's not as severe as cocaine.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime exposure, so medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high arrest and conviction count are major red flags. Other factors like living alone, limited education, and drug use add up. Despite some protective factors like his belief, the high-risk factors dominate. So I'm leaning towards predicting YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a range associated with higher recidivism risk, though not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"9 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED suggests some education but lack of enrollment may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job in a year indicates instability, a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
