    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But I'm not sure how significant age alone is. Maybe medium risk because it's a factor, but not the strongest.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example #2 and #9. So maybe this is a low risk factor because the lack of conviction might mean less severe charges or first-time offense leniency.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 160 lbs. Looking at the examples, physical build didn't seem to play a major role. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, like Example #6 where the person lived alone and had a \"YES\" outcome. But others living alone had \"NO\" outcomes too. Maybe medium risk because living alone could indicate less social support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This seems important. Many examples with no diploma, like Example #6 and #10, had \"YES\" outcomes. Education is a stabilizing factor, so lack of it might increase recidivism risk. High risk here.\n\nHe's held 5 jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate higher risk. In Example #6, the person held 2 jobs and had a \"YES\" outcome. Multiple job changes might suggest instability, so medium risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years. Many examples with drug use had varying outcomes, but consistent use can be a risk. Maybe medium risk because it's a common factor but not the most severe.\n\nFelt down some of the past month. Depression or low mood can increase recidivism as it might lead to poor decision-making. Example #3 had depression and a \"NO\" outcome, but others with similar feelings had \"YES\". Maybe medium risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child. This could indicate unstable upbringing, which might increase risk. Example #10 and #29 had similar backgrounds and \"YES\" outcomes. High risk.\n\nUrban area upbringing. Several examples from urban areas had higher recidivism, like Example #6 and #10. So maybe medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal happenings. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, like Example #2 and #5. So maybe low risk as it could provide a support system.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are lack of education and unstable upbringing. Medium factors include living alone, job instability, drug use, depression, and urban area. Lower factors are age, arrest without conviction, and religious beliefs. The combination leans towards a higher risk, but not extremely high. So I'll predict \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding five jobs in a year indicates instability, which can correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common factor but not as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could impair judgment and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological adults could indicate a unstable childhood, raising risk.\"),\n    (\"urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing is associated with higher crime exposure and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a support system, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
