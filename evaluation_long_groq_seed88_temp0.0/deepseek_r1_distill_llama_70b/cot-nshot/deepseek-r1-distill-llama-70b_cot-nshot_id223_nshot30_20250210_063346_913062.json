    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 20 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to \"NO\" outcomes, like in Example 9 and 12, but others with more arrests had \"YES\". So maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 160 lbs. That's average, so probably not a significant factor. Low risk.\n\nLiving alone might indicate less support, which could be a risk, but in some examples, living alone didn't necessarily lead to rearrest. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. People enrolled in college, like in Example 1, had lower recidivism. So low risk.\n\nHeld two jobs in the year. Employment is generally a positive factor, reducing recidivism. So low risk.\n\nDrug use with cocaine is a concern. Cocaine is a harder drug than marijuana, and in Example 6, multiple arrests and drug use led to \"YES\". So high risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he's not feeling depressed, that's a positive. Low risk.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, but urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates. Maybe medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, like Example 5. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from drug use, but several low-risk factors like education and employment. The lack of conviction and stable living situation might offset the drug use. So I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (20)\", \"medium\", \"Young adults may have higher risk due to impulsivity, but 20 is not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"First-time offenders without conviction often have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Average height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant risk associated with physical build.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"Urban upbringing with biological mother\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may pose challenges, but stable family background helps.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
