    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White female who's been arrested 9 times and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males, seem to have higher recidivism, but she's female. I'm not sure how gender affects it, but age itself might be a medium risk factor since she's still young.\n\nShe's been arrested 9 times and has a conviction. Looking at the examples, higher arrest numbers like 7, 8, 10 often led to YES outcomes. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 105 lbs. In the examples, weight didn't seem to be a major factor unless extreme, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, but not always. Maybe medium risk because living situation can influence support systems.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not continuing might be a medium risk.\n\nShe held 1 job in the past year. Employment is generally a protective factor, but only having one job might indicate instability, so medium risk.\n\nDrug use is marijuana in the past four years. In examples, marijuana use was common but not as risky as cocaine. So maybe medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but she's not feeling depressed, so low risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments sometimes had higher risks, but living with a biological parent is stable, so maybe low risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence. In examples, this sometimes correlated with higher risk, maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, high arrest/conviction count is a strong indicator. Other factors are mixed but lean towards medium. So I think the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher recidivism rates, especially for males, but being female may mitigate this risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"9 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests that the legal system has found her guilty, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"5 feet 3 inches and 105 lbs are within normal ranges and do not strongly correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone could indicate a lack of stable relationships, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year suggests some employment history, but limited job stability could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but less severe than other drugs; however, any drug use can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month reduces the risk of recidivism compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area suggests a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Not considering God's influence might reduce a potential protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
