    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males, seem to have higher recidivism, but she's female, which might lower the risk a bit. I'll consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those convicted, had higher risks. Since she hasn't been convicted, this might be a lower risk. So, low for arrest/conviction history.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. In the examples, being married and living with a spouse seemed to correlate with lower recidivism. So, that's a protective factor, low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might not be a big risk. I'll say low.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having a job is positive. Maybe low risk here.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than others. So, medium risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime exposure, so that's a medium risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism, so that's a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are her drug use and depression. However, she has several protective factors like being married, employed, and having a high school diploma. So, I think the prediction is NO, but I'm about 65% confident because while there are some risks, the protective factors are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate, though being female may lower it slightly.\"),\n    (\"arrest/conviction history\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not being enrolled in college may have minimal impact.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job in the past year indicates some stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism compared to harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed some of the time can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation at young age\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can act as a protective factor, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
