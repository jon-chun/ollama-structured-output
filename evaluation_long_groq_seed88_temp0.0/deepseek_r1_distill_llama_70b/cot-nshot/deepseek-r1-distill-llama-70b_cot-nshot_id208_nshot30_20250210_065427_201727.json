    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, might have a higher risk because they're still developing and might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure if 18 is considered high risk or medium. Looking at the examples, some 19-year-olds had medium risk, so maybe 18 is medium.\n\nShe's female. In the examples, most cases were males, but some females had higher risks, especially if they had multiple arrests. Since she's female and only one arrest, maybe her gender isn't a high risk factor. I'll say low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with one arrest but not convicted often had lower risk, like Example 4 and 9. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 113 lbs. That's pretty average, maybe even underweight. I don't see height/weight being a major factor unless it's extreme. So probably low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, which might increase risk. But being never married at 18 is common, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's enrolled in school. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled suggests she's engaged and less likely to reoffend. So low risk.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs in a year. That's a lot, indicating instability or difficulty keeping a job. Job instability can be a risk factor for recidivism because it might lead to financial stress. So high risk.\n\nShe's used drugs: marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor. It can lead to impaired judgment and legal troubles. High risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. So medium risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs were a protective factor. Not having them might slightly increase risk, but it's probably low.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are job instability and drug use. Medium factors include depression, living situation, and age. The rest are low. So overall, the prediction might lean towards YES, but her being in school and only one arrest might lower the confidence. I'll say 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which may indicate higher impulsivity but not yet fully developed decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest suggests limited criminal history, though the lack of conviction may indicate other factors at play.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight, no indication of physical risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone could indicate less social support, which might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school suggests engagement in positive activities, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Holding five jobs in one year indicates instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate underlying mental health issues that may increase risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may provide some stability but urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk, though this is less significant compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
