    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those who have been convicted, are higher risks. Since he hasn't been convicted, this might lower his risk. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 220 lbs. While being overweight can sometimes be a factor, in the examples, weight didn't seem to play a significant role unless it was extreme. So, maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, maybe due to less social support. So, this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might not be as protective as being enrolled. So, this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Stable employment usually reduces recidivism risk. So, having two jobs is a positive sign, making this a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, so not using drugs is a strong protective factor. This is definitely a low risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a positive. This is a low risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some studies, religious beliefs can reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his factors are low risk. The only medium risk is his age and living alone. Since the majority are low, I think the prediction is NO, and I'm about 85% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism, though not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment with two jobs suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk factors associated with mental health.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents indicates a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
