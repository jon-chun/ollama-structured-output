    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but being young might mean more life instability, so I'll consider it a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction didn't always lead to rearrest, but it does indicate some past involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows a history, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 163 lbs. This is slightly below average weight for his height, but I don't see a strong correlation between physique and recidivism in the examples. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate independence, but not living alone might mean he has family support, which could be a protective factor. However, in some examples, living alone was associated with higher risk. I'm a bit conflicted here, but I'll lean towards medium risk because living situation can influence behavior, but it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, so I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Having steady jobs suggests stability and responsibility, which lowers the risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health can play a role, but since he's not experiencing depression now, it's a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size six. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up in a larger household might have its challenges, but having biological parents suggests stability, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism, so this could be a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his factors are low or medium. The conviction and living situation are the main medium risks, but the presence of a high school diploma, employment, and stable family background are strong positives. Therefore, I predict he won't be rearrested, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a range where individuals may still be establishing stability, which could pose a moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some legal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might indicate less independence or support, which could be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression lowers the risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
