    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female who's been arrested 10 times and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might not have stable support systems. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a lot of arrests, which suggests a pattern of behavior. High arrest frequency is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5 feet and 109 lbs. That's quite petite. I don't think physical size is a significant factor here, so low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Having some employment could be a stabilizing factor, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign, so low risk.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression. Mental health can play a role, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this is low risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally positive. Maybe medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high arrest frequency and lack of education are strong indicators. However, she's employed, not using drugs, and has a supportive belief system. The high factors might outweigh the low ones, but her current stability might reduce the risk. I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age: 18\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and potential lack of stable support systems.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 10 times, convicted\", \"high\", \"High frequency of arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height: 5 feet, Weight: 109 lbs\", \"low\", \"Physical size is not a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Never married, living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs during the year\", \"medium\", \"Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of drug use reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No feelings of depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health stability reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally positive.\"),\n    (\"Believes God has something to do with her life\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
