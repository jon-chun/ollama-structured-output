    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, might have a higher risk because they're still developing and might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure if 19 is considered high risk. Maybe medium.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most cases are male, but some females had outcomes of both YES and NO. Gender alone might not be a strong indicator, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's White. The examples include various races, and race doesn't seem to directly correlate with the outcome, so probably low risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had NO outcomes, while others with more arrests had YES. Since she hasn't been convicted, this might lower her risk. Maybe medium because the arrest is still a factor.\n\nHer height and weight (5'9\", 140 lbs) don't seem to be significant factors in the examples. So low risk.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living alone didn't seem to be a strong factor, but being unmarried might relate to stability. Maybe low risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. In the examples, lack of education was a risk factor for recidivism. This could be medium or high. Since she's not enrolled in college either, that might compound the issue. So high risk.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate higher risk because it suggests instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a known risk factor. So high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium risk.\n\nLiving in a household of size 2 as a child. Smaller household size might not be as risky as larger ones, but it's not a strong indicator. Maybe low.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was a factor, but it's not clear how significant it is. Maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are lack of education and job instability. Medium factors are her age, arrest without conviction, and depression. The rest are low. So overall, I think she's at medium risk, but considering the examples, maybe she's more likely to not recidivate because she hasn't been convicted and has no drug use. So prediction is NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a range where individuals may still be developing impulse control, posing a moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to male.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race does not specifically indicate a higher risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some risk but not as severe as multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married is common and not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Holding 5 jobs in a year indicates instability, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Small household size is not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is not a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
