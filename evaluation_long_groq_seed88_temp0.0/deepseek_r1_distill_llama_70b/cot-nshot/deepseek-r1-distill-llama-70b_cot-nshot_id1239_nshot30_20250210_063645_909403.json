    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but being young might mean more life instability, so I'll consider it a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to \"NO\" outcomes, like in Example #9 and #12, but others with more arrests had \"YES\". Since he's only arrested once, this might be a lower risk, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 149 lbs. These are average and don't stand out as high risk factors. I don't see a strong correlation in the examples where physical size was a major determinant, so this is low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was present in some \"YES\" cases, like Example #6 and #19, but also in many \"NO\" cases. It might indicate less social support, so I'll rate it medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might limit opportunities. This could be a medium risk because lack of higher education sometimes correlated with higher recidivism, but it's not the strongest factor.\n\nHe held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate instability. This is a medium risk factor because consistent employment is a positive sign, but one job isn't as strong as multiple.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor. Many examples with multiple drug uses, especially harder drugs like cocaine, had higher recidivism. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's feeling down some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. This is a low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was linked to higher recidivism, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate it low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high drug use is the most concerning. However, he has a diploma and a job, which are positives. The mental health issue and living alone are negatives. The examples show that even with some positives, high drug use and mental health can lead to recidivism, but since he's only arrested once and not convicted, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a range where individuals may still be establishing stability, which could pose a moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job indicates some stability but may not be sufficient to mitigate other risks.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of both marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate underlying issues that may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may have some correlation but is not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"living situation at young age\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a rural area suggests a stable upbringing.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
