    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. So I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests without conviction sometimes led to a 'YES' outcome, like in example 6 and 10. So prior arrests without conviction might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 149 lbs. That's on the lower side for weight, maybe underweight. I don't see a strong correlation in the examples, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could indicate instability or lack of support, which might increase risk. So living situation is medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. In the examples, lack of education often correlated with higher recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this is high.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive, so low risk.\n\nFelt down some of the past month. Depression can increase recidivism risk, so medium.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 5. Stable family background might lower risk, so low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was protective, so low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are education and employment. Medium factors include age, arrests, living situation, and depression. The rest are low. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a 'YES' prediction, but not with very high confidence because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction may indicate potential risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing may reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"May act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
