    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. But I'm not sure how significant age is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some people with one arrest but no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example #9. But others with more arrests, even without conviction, sometimes had \"YES\". So maybe the number of arrests is more important than conviction status.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 170 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between physical build and recidivism in the examples. So maybe this is a low factor.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone was a factor in some examples, but not sure. Maybe living situation isn't a big risk factor here.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Education level seems important. Those without a diploma or GED had higher recidivism in some cases, like Example #6. So having a GED might lower the risk compared to not having one, but not being enrolled in college might not be as positive as being enrolled.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment seems to reduce recidivism. People with more jobs, like Example #5 with two jobs, had \"NO\" outcomes. So this might be a protective factor, lowering risk.\n\nHe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor. Examples like #6 and #25 had drug use and higher recidivism. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Depression was a factor in some cases, but its absence might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban upbringing sometimes correlated with higher recidivism, but not always. Maybe a medium factor.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, those who didn't consider God had higher recidivism, like Example #10 and #29. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the main high-risk factors are the drug use and possibly the lack of divine influence. Employment and having a GED are protective. The arrest without conviction is a bit of a mixed signal. I think the drug use is a strong indicator, so I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction, but I'm not super confident because employment and education might mitigate it a bit. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, but not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs indicates stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not being enrolled in college may not provide sufficient stability.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may reduce isolation but isn't a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may correlate with higher recidivism in some cases.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing can be a risk factor but isn't definitive.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
