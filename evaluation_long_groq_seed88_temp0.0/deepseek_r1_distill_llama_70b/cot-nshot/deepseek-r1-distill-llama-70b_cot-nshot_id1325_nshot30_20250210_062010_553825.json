    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic female and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, younger males, especially those under 21, seem to have higher recidivism, but she's female and a bit older. I'm not sure how much age plays a role here, but maybe it's a low factor since she's not in the higher-risk younger group.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most of the higher recidivism cases are males. So being female might lower her risk. That could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's Hispanic. The examples don't show a strong correlation with ethnicity directly, so maybe that's a low factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially multiple ones, had higher recidivism. One arrest is on the lower side, so maybe medium risk because it's a first offense but still a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so probably not a significant factor. Low risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. In the examples, being married or living with someone seemed to correlate with lower recidivism. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, so having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might not be a big issue. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the year. Stable employment usually reduces recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples, so not using drugs is a low risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so being mentally stable is a low risk.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The only medium factor is the single arrest and conviction, but since it's a first offense, it's not as high as multiple arrests. So overall, the prediction is NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is within a lower risk age range compared to younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is associated with lower recidivism rates in the examples.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic background doesn't strongly correlate with higher recidivism in examples.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight, not significant.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse is protective.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is protective, not being in college is neutral.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment with three jobs reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is protective.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is associated with lower recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
