    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But I'm not sure how significant age alone is. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a lot. In the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, often led to YES outcomes. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 170 lbs. I don't see height and weight being major factors unless extreme, which this isn't. So low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone didn't seem to be a big factor, but being unmarried might indicate instability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, but not being enrolled might mean less structure. Medium risk.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having two jobs might lower his risk. Maybe low.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a common risk factor, but marijuana alone is less severe than harder drugs. Medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, so this might lower it. Low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might reduce risk, so low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism. So maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the biggest red flags. Other factors are mixed but lean towards lower risk. However, the high arrest count is a strong indicator. So I'm leaning towards predicting YES with high confidence, maybe 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"9 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests that the arrests led to serious charges, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college may indicate less engagement in rehabilitative activities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs suggests some stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but still indicates substance use, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide some social support, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces risk factors associated with unstable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a protective factor against recidivism, as it can offer social support and moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
