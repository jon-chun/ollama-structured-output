    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction didn't always lead to a YES, but multiple arrests did. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate some instability, but in the examples, living alone didn't always correlate with higher risk. Maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. In the examples, lack of education was a significant factor, often leading to higher recidivism. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be protective, but only having one job might indicate instability. Maybe medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive, so low risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, so low.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was linked to higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education and medium from mental health and living situation might tip the prediction towards YES, but not with high confidence because other factors are low or medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"low\", \"One arrest and conviction may indicate some risk but is not as significant as multiple offenses.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age could indicate instability or lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests some instability in employment history.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate underlying mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a small household suggests a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may be associated with higher risk in some studies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
