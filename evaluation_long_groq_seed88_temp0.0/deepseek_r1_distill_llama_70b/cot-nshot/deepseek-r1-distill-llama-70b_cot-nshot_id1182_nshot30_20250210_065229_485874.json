    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but combined with other factors, it might influence the prediction.\n\nHe's been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, higher arrest numbers (like 5, 7, 8, 10) often correlate with a \"YES\" outcome, especially when there's a conviction. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 142 lbs. In the examples, weight and height don't seem to be significant predictors on their own, so I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, marital status and living alone don't strongly correlate with recidivism, so this is probably a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might not be as protective. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Employment is generally a protective factor. Having steady work can reduce recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor. However, he's only used marijuana, which is less severe than cocaine or multiple drugs. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling depressed, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban upbringing can have higher crime exposure, so this might be a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs can be a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and conviction are the strongest indicators. Despite some protective factors like employment and education, the high arrest count and drug use tip the prediction towards \"YES.\" My confidence is around 75% because while the factors are concerning, there are elements that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a range where recidivism is possible but not strongly indicative.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"7 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a serious offense history, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs suggests some stability, reducing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not enrolled in college may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
