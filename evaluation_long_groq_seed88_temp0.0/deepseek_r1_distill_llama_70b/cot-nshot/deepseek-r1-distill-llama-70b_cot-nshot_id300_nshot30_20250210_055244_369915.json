    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their early 20s, seem to have varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but it's a low risk factor because he's not a minor anymore, which might mean he's more responsible, but still young enough that impulsive behavior could be a factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are a red flag. In example #6, the person had 7 arrests and was convicted, leading to a YES. Similarly, example #19 had 5 arrests and a conviction, also YES. So, two arrests with a conviction might be a medium risk factor because it's not as high as 5 or 7, but still significant.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 155 lbs. That's on the lower side for weight, maybe underweight. I don't see a strong correlation between weight and recidivism in the examples, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone didn't seem to be a major factor, but being unmarried might indicate less stability. However, since many examples had similar living situations without rearrest, I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, which could be a medium risk. However, in some examples, people without college still didn't reoffend, so maybe it's lower. I'll go with medium.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment is a stabilizing factor, but only having one job might indicate instability. In example #6, the person had 2 jobs but still reoffended. So, having one job could be a medium risk because it shows some employment but maybe not enough stability.\n\nDrug use is marijuana and cocaine. In the examples, multiple drug use, especially harder drugs like cocaine, was a significant factor. For example, #6 used marijuana, and #19 used marijuana as well. So, using two drugs is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. In example #3, feeling down was a factor, and he didn't reoffend, but in others, it was a contributing factor. I'll consider this a medium risk because it's not constant but still present.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. So, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were present in both YES and NO outcomes, so it's not a strong indicator. I'll mark this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are drug use and maybe employment. The medium factors are conviction history, education, and mental health. The rest are low. So, the overall prediction is YES because the drug use and conviction history are significant, but my confidence isn't too high because other factors like education and employment might mitigate it a bit. I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is considered young but not a minor, which might indicate some level of maturity.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests with a conviction indicate a history of legal issues, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"5 feet 11 inches and 155 lbs is within a normal range and not indicative of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Never married and living alone is common and not a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job in the past year suggests some stability but could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Using both marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed some of the time could contribute to higher risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation as a child\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area is a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is not a strong indicator of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
