    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and between 125-149 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between physical size and recidivism in the examples, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. In the examples, living alone or not didn't seem to be a major factor, but being unmarried might be a low risk factor as it could relate to stability.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs during the year. Employment can be a protective factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability, so maybe a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological dad in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but living with a biological parent could be stabilizing. So maybe a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life. In the examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so maybe a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are multiple arrests/convictions and lack of education. Medium factors include her age, employment instability, and mental health. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old, which is a young age that may correlate with higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"6 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a significant criminal history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"holding 2 jobs may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"recent feelings of depression could impact behavior and decision-making\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"not living alone may provide some stability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"living with biological father in a rural area may provide some support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide a positive influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
