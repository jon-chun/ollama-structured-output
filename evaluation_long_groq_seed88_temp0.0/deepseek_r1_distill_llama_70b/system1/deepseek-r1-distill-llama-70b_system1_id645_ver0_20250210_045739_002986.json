    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 155 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate some social isolation, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. He's held two jobs in the past year, which might suggest some instability or perhaps he's still figuring out his career path.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Marijuana use is common, but feeling down could indicate potential mental health issues, like depression. However, it's noted that he sometimes feels down, not constantly, so it's not a severe indicator yet.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Also, he believes God has something to do with his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the arrest, job changes, and occasional feelings of sadness. However, without a conviction, stable upbringing, and religious support, these factors don't strongly indicate a high risk. The confidence is moderate because while there are some flags, they aren't severe enough to push it into high risk territory.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\", \"felt down in the past month\", \"held 2 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
