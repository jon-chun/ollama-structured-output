Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to societal factors, but without context on how that influences risk, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean she's at risk of future legal issues, but it's not a strong indicator alone. It depends on the circumstances of the arrest.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 110 lbs. These are average and don't typically indicate any specific risk unless related to health, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect stability, but not living alone doesn't inherently mean high risk. It could mean she has a support system.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, indicating stability and lower risk of negative outcomes.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than other drugs. It's also common, so the impact might be lower unless it's frequent or problematic.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Good mental health is a positive sign, reducing some risks associated with mental health issues.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and job instability. However, the presence of education, stable upbringing, and mental health are protective. The drug use is mild. So, overall, the risk isn't high. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"held 3 jobs in a year\", \"past marijuana use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
