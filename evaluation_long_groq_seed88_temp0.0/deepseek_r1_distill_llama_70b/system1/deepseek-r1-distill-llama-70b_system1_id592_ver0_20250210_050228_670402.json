    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. His age is relatively young, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to recidivism. Each arrest and conviction adds to the likelihood of future issues.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 145 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might contribute to higher risk factors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, especially if it affects employment opportunities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential risk, as it can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but the absence of depression doesn't necessarily negate other risk factors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. The family structure here seems stable, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a protective factor for some, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the history of arrests, convictions, unemployment, and drug use are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like age and living situation might contribute, the combination of criminal history and substance use are particularly concerning. I'm about 85% confident that these factors indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
