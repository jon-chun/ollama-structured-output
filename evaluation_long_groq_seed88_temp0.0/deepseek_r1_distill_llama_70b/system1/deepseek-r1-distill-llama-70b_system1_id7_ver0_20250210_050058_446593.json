    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 220 lbs. That's a high BMI, which is around 33, so he's obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors or outcomes, but I'm not sure how it ties into social or behavioral risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect job prospects and income, which might relate to risk factors, but having a diploma is a positive point.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a strong positive indicator. No recent substance abuse or mental health issues suggests lower risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but with a stable home, the risk might be mitigated.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor against negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the negative factors are the arrest, job changes, and living alone. However, the positives are no drug use, stable upbringing, religious beliefs, and education. The lack of conviction and no recent mental health issues are also positives. So, the overall risk seems low. I'll predict \"NO\" with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"high BMI\", \"job instability\", \"lives alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
