    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law. I should consider this as a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED could be a risk factor because education often correlates with stability and opportunities. Not being enrolled in college might limit his future prospects, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor, as it might indicate issues with employment or financial stability. However, at 18, it's not uncommon to have limited work experience.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. These are positive signs and lower the risk factors related to substance abuse and mental health.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. A larger household might indicate economic stress, but living with a biological parent could provide stability. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or coping mechanisms, but I'm not sure how significant this is in terms of risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest, lack of education, and job instability. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression, along with living with a biological parent, might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" but with lower confidence, maybe around 40%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"no high school diploma\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
