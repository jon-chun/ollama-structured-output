    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. A criminal history is a significant risk factor because it suggests past engagement in illegal activities, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and 148 lbs. Physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk behavior, so I can probably ignore that. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not too strong on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment and criminal behavior. He's held two jobs in the past year, which might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, but since he hasn't used any in four years, that's a point against high risk.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase risk if left untreated. However, feeling down doesn't necessarily mean severe mental illness, so the impact here is moderate.\n\nHe grew up in a household of eight. A large family size might indicate overcrowding or less attention from parents, which can be a risk factor for behavioral issues. However, this alone isn't definitive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might lower risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, lower education, job instability, and mental health issues are significant. However, no recent drug use and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The overall risk seems moderate, so I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"criminal history\",\n    \"lower educational attainment\",\n    \"job instability\",\n    \"mental health issues\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
