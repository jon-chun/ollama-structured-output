    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can indicate a higher risk, especially if it's related to violent offenses, but the type of crime isn't specified here. However, having a conviction does point towards some level of risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 120 lbs. That's average and doesn't seem to pose any risk factors.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but not living alone doesn't directly indicate high risk. It might mean she has family around her, which could be a protective factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other personal issues, potentially increasing risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. That's a positive factor, as drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHowever, she's felt down for the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health can be a significant risk factor for self-harm, suicide, or other negative outcomes.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and other stressors, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nShe feels that God has nothing to do with her life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a protective factor for some people. Without it, she might have fewer coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, lack of education, job instability, and current depression are significant risk factors. However, the absence of drug use is a mitigating factor. The mental health issue is concerning and could elevate the risk. Considering all these, I think the overall risk is high, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors like the type of conviction and exact mental health state aren't detailed. So, I'll predict high risk with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
