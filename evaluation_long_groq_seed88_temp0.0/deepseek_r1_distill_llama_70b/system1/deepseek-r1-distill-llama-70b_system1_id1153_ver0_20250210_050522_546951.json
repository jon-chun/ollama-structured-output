    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but since there are no convictions, it might not be as severe. However, multiple arrests could indicate a pattern of behavior that's risky.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 160 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 30, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, which is a risk factor, but I'm not sure how this ties into the overall risk assessment unless it's related to other behaviors.\n\nShe hasn't finished high school and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges. Not having a job in the past year adds to that, as unemployment can lead to financial instability and other issues.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. However, marijuana is legal in some places, so the risk might be lower compared to harder drugs.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe grew up in a large household of 10 in an urban area. Living in a crowded household might indicate socioeconomic challenges or lack of resources, which can contribute to higher risk factors. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and other environmental risks.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, but it depends on how she uses this belief.\n\nPutting it all together, the lack of education, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and challenging upbringing all point towards higher risk factors. However, the absence of convictions and the presence of religious beliefs might lower the risk a bit. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors could mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"arrests without conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"large household\", \"urban environment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
