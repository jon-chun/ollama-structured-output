    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean less life experience, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of legal issues. This could point to a higher risk, especially if the convictions are for serious offenses, but the type of crimes isn't specified here.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. Physical attributes alone don't usually indicate risk unless in specific contexts, like sports injuries or something else, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for various issues, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socio-economic challenges, which might contribute to higher risk in certain contexts.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor for financial instability, which might lead to other issues, but again, it's context-dependent.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors, so their absence lowers the risk.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 14 in an urban area. Living in a crowded household might indicate economic challenges or less individual attention, which can be risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are concerning, but the absence of drug use and depression, along with religious support, might mitigate some risks. However, the lack of education and employment could still pose challenges. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. So, the prediction would be \"YES\" for high risk, but with a confidence level that's not too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"high arrest and conviction history\", \"lack of education and employment\", \"large household and urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
