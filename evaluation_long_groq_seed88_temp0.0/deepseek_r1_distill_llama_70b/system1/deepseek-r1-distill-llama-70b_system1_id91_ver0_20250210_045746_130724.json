    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 155 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but unless there's a health issue, this might not be a significant risk factor. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, suggesting stability and lower risk. He's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some employment history but could also indicate instability if he's moving jobs frequently.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can be associated with more severe issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. He believes God has a role in his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the drug use, particularly cocaine. However, other factors like education and stable upbringing mitigate this risk. His lack of depression and stable living situation also lower the risk. So, while there's some risk, it's not high overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"arrested once\", \"living alone\", \"held 2 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
