    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if he's committed serious offenses. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 149 lbs. Physical characteristics don't typically indicate risk unless in extreme cases, which this isn't.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, but it might indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is associated with higher risk of unemployment and other issues, which is a significant risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years. This is a positive factor, reducing the risk associated with substance abuse.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can be a risk factor if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five. A stable family structure with biological parents is generally a protective factor, so this might lower risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education and unemployment are significant risks. However, no drug use, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are protective. The mental health aspect is a concern but not as severe without other factors. The arrests without convictions are a moderate risk. Overall, while there are some risk factors, the presence of protective factors might balance them out, leading to a moderate confidence that the risk isn't high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 19 (young adult, higher impulsivity risk)\",\n    \"Race: Black (socioeconomic factors may play a role)\",\n    \"Arrested 2 times (potential legal issues, though no convictions)\",\n    \"No high school diploma or GED (limited opportunities)\",\n    \"Unemployed (financial instability)\",\n    \"Recent feelings of depression (mental health concern)\",\n    \"Living alone (potential social isolation)\",\n    \"Religious beliefs (possible protective factor)\",\n    \"Stable family upbringing (protective factor)\",\n    \"No drug use (positive behavior)\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
