    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can indicate a higher risk, especially if it's related to more serious offenses, but I don't know the nature of the conviction here. It could be a misdemeanor or something more severe.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 150-174 lbs. That's within a normal range, so I don't see that as a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, which isn't mentioned.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also mean limited social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors or mental health issues.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky behaviors. It can limit opportunities and contribute to a cycle of poverty or instability.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky activities, whether criminal or otherwise. It can also contribute to mental health issues due to lack of purpose or income.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can impair judgment, lead to legal issues, health problems, and can be a sign of underlying issues like mental health disorders. Recent use, especially cocaine, is more concerning than marijuana because of its higher potential for addiction and negative consequences.\n\nShe's felt down and unable to be cheered up some of the time in the past month. This indicates possible depression or mood disorders. Mental health issues can increase risk factors, especially if left untreated. It can lead to self-medication with drugs, which she's already using.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to risky behaviors, but living with a biological parent might provide some stability. Household size isn't directly a risk factor, but urban areas might expose her to more risks.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of community, which might reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and mental health issues are all significant risk factors. However, her belief in God might offer some support. The presence of multiple risk factors, especially drug use and mental health, leans towards a higher risk assessment. But I'm not 100% confident because some factors like living situation and belief system might mitigate some risks. So, I'll predict high risk with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
