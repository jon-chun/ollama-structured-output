    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate independence, but it might also suggest limited social support, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, associated with lower risk. She's held two jobs in the past year, which might indicate stability or perhaps instability if she's moving jobs frequently, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can be more indicative of substance abuse issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Depression is a risk factor for other issues, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 3. A stable family environment with biological parents is generally a protective factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than personal risk factors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and are often associated with lower risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the main risk factor here is the drug use, especially cocaine. However, she's educated, employed, and has a stable upbringing. The lack of depression and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk overall. Therefore, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"arrested once\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
