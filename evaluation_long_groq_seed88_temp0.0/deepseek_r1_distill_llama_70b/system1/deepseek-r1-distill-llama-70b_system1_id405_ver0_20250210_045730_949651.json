    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Age and gender can be factors, but being young might mean she's still developing and could be more impressionable or vulnerable to certain risks.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're recent or related to serious offenses. However, without knowing the nature of the crimes, it's a bit hard to gauge, but it's still a red flag.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'8\" and between 200-224 lbs. While BMI can be a health indicator, alone it might not directly correlate with high risk unless it's related to other health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of support system, which can be a risk factor for various issues like mental health or financial instability.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This is a significant risk factor because education level is linked to employment opportunities, income, and social mobility. Without a diploma, she might face more challenges in securing stable jobs, which can lead to economic hardship and other related risks.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, lack of skills, or other underlying problems. It could also suggest she's still figuring out her career path, but frequent job changes can be a risk factor for economic instability.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a clear risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug with more severe addiction potential. Recent use (within the past four years) suggests ongoing issues that could impact her health, legal status, and personal life.\n\nShe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health can significantly impact overall well-being and can be a risk factor for other issues like substance abuse, poor job performance, or social withdrawal.\n\nHer living situation as a child: lived with non-biological adults in an urban area. This could mean she had an unstable home environment, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including behavioral issues, mental health problems, and difficulty in school.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. While spirituality can be a support system, if it's used to avoid dealing with problems or seeking help, it might not mitigate risks effectively.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors here point towards high risk: criminal history, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, mental health issues, and a potentially unstable upbringing. These factors can compound each other, leading to a higher likelihood of negative outcomes. However, her belief in a higher power might provide some support, which could slightly lower the risk. But overall, the presence of multiple significant risk factors leans towards a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"unstable employment\", \"substance abuse\", \"mental health issues\", \"unstable upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
