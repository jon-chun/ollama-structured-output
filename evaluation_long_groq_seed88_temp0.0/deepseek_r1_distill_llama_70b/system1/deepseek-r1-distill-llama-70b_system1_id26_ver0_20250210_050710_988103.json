    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law. That could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 135 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but I don't see how that directly relates to risk unless it's a sign of other issues, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might not be unusual, but it could indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education can limit opportunities, which might contribute to higher risk situations, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate financial instability or other issues.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and not as high risk as other drugs, but any drug use can be a factor depending on frequency and context.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. Depression can be a risk factor, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nHe lived in a household of six as a child. A larger household might indicate overcrowding or financial stress, which can be risk factors for various issues.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest and job instability are the main concerns. However, the absence of conviction, no depression, and only marijuana use are mitigating factors. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk overall. I'm about 65% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"job instability\", \"living alone\", \"limited education\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
