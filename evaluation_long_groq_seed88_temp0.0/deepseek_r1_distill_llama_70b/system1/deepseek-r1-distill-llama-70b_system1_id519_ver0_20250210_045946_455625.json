    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. So, this might not be a significant factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches tall. Height alone isn't typically a risk factor unless it's related to physical intimidation, but that's not specified here. So, I don't think this is a major concern.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, especially if he's in school. Not being married at this age is pretty common, so this might not be a risk factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. This is a positive factor because being in school can indicate stability and a focus on the future, which might lower risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Changing jobs frequently might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to other problems like reliability or behavioral issues.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Recent use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, is concerning.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health can be a risk factor if it's not addressed, leading to further problems.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. A larger household might have its own challenges, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is a risk factor. It could mean more support or more stress, depending on the family dynamics.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can be a positive factor, providing support and structure, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and recent feelings of depression stand out as significant risk factors. The job instability is also a concern. However, being in school and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, I think these factors do indicate a high risk, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors are positive. Maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"job instability\", \"arrest history\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
