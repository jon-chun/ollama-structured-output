    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and race aren't inherently risk factors, but being young might relate to other factors like impulsivity or lack of stable life experience.\n\nShe has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in illegal activities. This could indicate a higher risk of reoffending or being a danger to others.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'6\" and 135 lbs. These are average and don't pose a specific risk on their own unless related to substance use or other health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age might indicate independence, but without a support system, it could also mean isolation, which might contribute to other risk factors like mental health issues.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior or other negative outcomes.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is legal in some places, frequent use can impair judgment and contribute to other risk factors, especially if it's used as a coping mechanism.\n\nShe's felt down and uncheerable some of the time in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for self-harm or other negative behaviors.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose, which might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, possible mental health issues, and a challenging upbringing in an urban area all point towards higher risk. However, her belief in God might offer some support. The confidence level is high because several significant risk factors are present, but not all factors are negative.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Drug use\", \"Possible mental health issues\", \"Challenging upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
