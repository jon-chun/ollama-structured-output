    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender aren't necessarily risk factors on their own, but they can influence other aspects. Being young might relate to impulsivity, but that's not directly indicated here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could still indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 120 lbs. These are average and don't pose any specific risk factors.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 21 is common, and living situation might affect social support, but not necessarily a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college isn't a risk factor by itself.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a factor; frequent job changes might indicate instability, but two jobs in a year isn't excessive.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years. This is a positive sign, indicating she's avoided substance abuse, which is a protective factor.\n\nShe's felt down some times in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, but it's not at a level that suggests severe mental health issues unless it's persistent or severe.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of four. A stable family background is a protective factor, suggesting a supportive environment.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This might relate to coping mechanisms or support systems, but it's not a direct risk factor unless it leads to isolation.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are neutral or positive. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern, but without other negative factors, the overall risk seems low. The occasional feeling down could be a minor concern but not indicative of high risk. So, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"occasional feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
