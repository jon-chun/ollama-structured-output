    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher risk behaviors. Next, he's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. That might suggest some risky behavior but not necessarily a high risk of future issues.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 165 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could indicate independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower earning potential, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors. He's held two jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another potential risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. However, he's felt down recently, which could point to mental health issues. Depression can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of four. Stable family environment might lower risk, but without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's hard to assess. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life, which might affect his support system or coping mechanisms, but that's more about personal belief than a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: young age, multiple arrests, lack of education, job instability, and recent depression are concerning. However, no drug use and a stable upbringing might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"multiple arrests\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"recent depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
