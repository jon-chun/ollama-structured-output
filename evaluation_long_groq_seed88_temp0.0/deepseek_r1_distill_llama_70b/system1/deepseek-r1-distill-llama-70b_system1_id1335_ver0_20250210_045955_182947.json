    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risks.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 175-199 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for his height, but not necessarily a risk factor unless related to health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for various issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a red flag. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher risks in employment, income, and potentially criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability can indicate financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than harder drugs. However, it's still a consideration.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so this is a protective factor.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 8 with his biological mother. Large family size can sometimes lead to less individual attention, potentially increasing risks, but living with a biological parent is a stabilizing factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, low education, job instability, and drug use are significant risk factors. However, his mental health is good, he has a religious support system, and living with a biological parent as a child is positive. The presence of criminal history and socioeconomic factors (education, employment) are strong indicators, but the protective factors might lower the overall risk slightly. So, I'd predict high risk but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
