    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but in this case, being young might relate to inexperience, but I'm not sure how that ties to risk yet.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're recent. However, I don't know the nature of the arrests or convictions, which could affect the assessment. If they were for violent crimes, that's different from non-violent ones.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'3\" and 170 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 31.8, which is obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain contexts, like health risks, but I'm not sure how it ties to behavioral or recidivism risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing risk of reoffending or other negative behaviors.\n\nShe has a GED, so she has a basic education. Not being enrolled in college might limit her opportunities, but having a GED is better than not having any diploma. Education can sometimes correlate with lower risk if it leads to stable employment.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk if it's due to behavioral problems or could be a sign of searching for better opportunities.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign, as substance abuse is a significant risk factor for many negative outcomes.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health is important; lack of depression could lower risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a small household as a child. Stable family environment is a protective factor, which might lower risk.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some negative factors like arrests and job instability, but also several positive factors like stable marriage, no drug use, good mental health, and a supportive upbringing. The convictions are concerning, but without knowing the severity, it's hard to weigh. Overall, the positive factors might outweigh the negatives, leading to a lower risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
