    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but it's not a conviction, so it's a bit neutral.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 160 lbs. That's a bit on the lighter side for his height, but not significantly underweight. Physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of strong family support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit opportunities, leading to higher risks of unemployment, lower income, and potentially engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with commitment, behavior, or perhaps underlying personal problems. This could be a risk factor for financial instability or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Marijuana use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. It can also affect motivation and decision-making.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase risk of various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living conditions as a child can be a risk factor for behavioral issues, as it might indicate neglect or an unstable home environment.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, job instability, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable childhood are all risk factors. However, the absence of a conviction and the presence of religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence is moderate because while there are several concerning factors, some elements like the arrest without conviction and religious influence lower the overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"gender\", \"arrest_history\", \"education_level\", \"employment_history\", \"substance_use\", \"mental_health\", \"living_situation\", \"childhood_environment\", \"religious_beliefs\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
