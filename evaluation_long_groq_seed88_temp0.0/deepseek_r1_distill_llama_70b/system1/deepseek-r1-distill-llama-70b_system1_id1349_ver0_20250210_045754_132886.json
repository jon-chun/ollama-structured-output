    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Her age is quite young, which might indicate less life experience, but being young can sometimes mean more resilience. Her race and gender might not directly indicate risk, but could be contextual based on societal factors, though I shouldn't make assumptions there.\n\nShe's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or ongoing legal issues. However, I should consider the nature of the arrests and convictions, which isn't provided here. Still, multiple arrests do raise a red flag.\n\nHer height and weight are 5 feet and 109 lbs. That's a bit below average height but within a normal weight range. I don't see how this directly relates to risk factors unless in specific contexts, but it's probably not a major factor here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk factor for various issues, including recidivism or mental health concerns.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the risk of unemployment, poverty, and potentially criminal activity as a means of survival. This is a significant risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, another risk factor. However, having had jobs shows some level of engagement, so it's a bit mixed.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive; substance abuse and mental health issues are major risk factors, so their absence lowers the risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and more challenges, but living with a biological parent might provide some stability. Household size isn't directly a risk factor, but urban environments can have their own set of challenges.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by offering a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the high number of arrests and convictions are concerning. Lack of education and job instability are risk factors, but the absence of recent drug use or depression, along with religious support, might mitigate some risks. Her young age could mean she's still developing and might have more opportunities to change her trajectory.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but considering the multiple arrests and convictions, it's probably on the higher side. However, without knowing the context of the arrests, it's a bit tricky. The lack of education and job instability are significant, but the absence of substance abuse and mental health issues are positives.\n\nSo, I think the prediction is YES for high risk, but the confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors. Maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Job instability\", \"Living alone at a young age\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
