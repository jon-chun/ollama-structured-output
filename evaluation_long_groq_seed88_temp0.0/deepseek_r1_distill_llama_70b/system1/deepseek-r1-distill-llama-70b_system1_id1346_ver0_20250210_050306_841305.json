    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but I'm not sure how significant they are on their own. Being young might mean less life experience, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of problematic behavior, which might suggest a higher risk, especially if the convictions are for serious offenses. However, without knowing the nature of the arrests, it's a bit tricky, but it's still a point to consider.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, so I don't think that's a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and possibly higher involvement in risky behaviors. This could contribute to a higher risk assessment.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or illegal activities. This is another point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities. This is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can be a risk factor, the absence of depression here might lower the risk compared to someone who is depressed. However, other mental health issues could still be present, but it's not indicated here.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of size 4. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risky behaviors, which might contribute to higher risk. Living with his mother suggests some family support, which could be a protective factor, but the urban setting might counteract that.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or a different coping mechanism, but I'm not sure how significant this is as a risk factor. It might vary depending on individual circumstances.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are the arrests, conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These factors together do point towards a higher risk. However, the absence of depression and living with family might slightly mitigate the risk, but not enough to outweigh the other factors. So, I would predict a high risk with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
