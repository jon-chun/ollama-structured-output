    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 113 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest some independence, but it's not inherently a risk factor. Being enrolled in school is actually a positive factor as it indicates engagement and potential for stability.\n\nShe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can be associated with more severe issues. Recent use in the past month is concerning.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles are risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of three. Living in an urban area might have its own challenges, but the household size isn't unusually large or small. The fact that she doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life might indicate a lack of social support or different coping mechanisms, but this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and mental health issues are the most concerning factors. While other aspects like job instability and arrest are notable, they aren't as severe. The presence of drug use, especially cocaine, and recent feelings of depression are strong indicators of potential high risk. However, she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign that might mitigate some risks.\n\nI think the risk is present, but considering her age and the fact that she's in school, the confidence might not be extremely high. Maybe around 70% confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"mental health issues (feeling down)\", \"job instability (5 jobs in a year)\", \"arrest history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
