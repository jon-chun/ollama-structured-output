    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant because they indicate a history of legal issues, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a risk factor. Not being married and not living alone might suggest less social support, which can be a risk factor for various issues, including mental health or recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities, which could be a risk factor for unemployment or other issues.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor for financial instability, which might contribute to other risks.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a known risk factor, so not using is a good sign.\n\nHowever, he's felt down for the past month. That's a red flag for depression or mental health issues, which can increase risk factors for various negative outcomes, including self-harm or other behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more challenges, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator. The recent depression is concerning. However, the absence of drug use and having a supportive belief system are positives. The employment instability and lack of social support (not living alone, not married) are negatives. \n\nI think the risk is present, especially considering the legal history and mental health issues. But the confidence isn't 100% because there are mitigating factors like no drug use and religious support. So, I'll predict YES with a confidence level around 80.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"recent feelings of depression\", \"unstable employment\", \"lack of social support\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
