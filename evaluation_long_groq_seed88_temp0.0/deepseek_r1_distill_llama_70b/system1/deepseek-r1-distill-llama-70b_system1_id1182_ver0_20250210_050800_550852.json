    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested 7 times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 142 lbs. I don't see how that directly relates to risk assessment. Maybe in certain contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a major risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but living alone doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk. It's more about social support, which could be a factor, but not a strong one.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which might influence risk, but having a diploma is a positive point. Not being in college isn't a negative per se.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to financial instability and possibly illegal activities.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor for recidivism, as it can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but the absence of depression might lower that aspect, though other mental health issues could still be present.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. A large household in an urban setting might indicate exposure to higher crime areas or resource limitations, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. The job instability and drug use add to that. However, the high school diploma, lack of depression, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. So, I'm leaning towards high risk but not with absolute certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
