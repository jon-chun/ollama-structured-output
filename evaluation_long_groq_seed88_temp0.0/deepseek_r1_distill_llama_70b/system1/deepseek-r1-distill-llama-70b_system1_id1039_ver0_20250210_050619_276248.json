    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHer height is 5'4\", which is average and probably not relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of support system, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment and lack of higher education can be risk factors for various negative outcomes, including financial instability or getting into trouble.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults in a large household in an urban area as a child. Unstable living conditions and a large household might contribute to environmental risk factors, such as exposure to violence or neglect.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of community.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, unemployment, living alone without a support system, and unstable childhood are significant risk factors. However, the absence of recent depression and her religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"unstable living conditions\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
