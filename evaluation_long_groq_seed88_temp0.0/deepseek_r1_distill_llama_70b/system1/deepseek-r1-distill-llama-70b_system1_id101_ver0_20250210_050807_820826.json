    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 22 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 190 lbs. While physical size might be a consideration in certain contexts, it's not a direct indicator of risk behavior. More important is his marital status and living situation. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment stability, which in turn can influence risk factors. He's held two jobs in the past year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another potential risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign as mental health can also play a role in risk.\n\nHis living situation as a child was with his biological mother in a household of size three. A stable family environment can be protective, so this might lower his risk. He believes God has a role in his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant factors are the criminal history and drug use. These are strong indicators of potential high risk. However, the presence of a stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some of that risk. His employment history is a bit unstable, which could contribute to risk but isn't as severe as the other factors.\n\nSo, considering all these, I would predict a high risk, but with moderate confidence because there are both strong risk factors and some mitigating circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"employment instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
