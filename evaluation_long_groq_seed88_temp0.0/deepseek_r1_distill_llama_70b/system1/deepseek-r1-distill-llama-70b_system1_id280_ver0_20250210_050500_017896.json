    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate some risky behavior but not necessarily a high risk of future issues.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower socioeconomic status, which might correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign; substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors, so their absence lowers risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but his family stability might mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education and job instability are risk factors, but the absence of drug use, mental health issues, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are protective. The multiple arrests without convictions are concerning but not conclusive. Overall, the protective factors seem to outweigh the risks, so I'd predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 21\",\n    \"Gender: Male\",\n    \"Race: Black\",\n    \"Arrests: 6 times (no convictions)\",\n    \"Height: 5 feet 7 inches\",\n    \"Weight: 170 lbs\",\n    \"Marital Status: Never married\",\n    \"Living Situation: Living alone\",\n    \"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Employment: Held 1 job during the year\",\n    \"Drug Use: No drug use in the past four years\",\n    \"Mental Health: No depression in the past month\",\n    \"Family Background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age\",\n    \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
