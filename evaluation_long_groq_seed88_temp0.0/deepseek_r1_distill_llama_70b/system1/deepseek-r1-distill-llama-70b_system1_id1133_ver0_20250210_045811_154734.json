    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might indicate less life experience and possibly higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested 17 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of run-ins with the law, which suggests a pattern of behavior that could be risky or problematic.\n\nHe's 5'3\" and 155 lbs. I don't think physical size is a significant risk factor here. Moving on, he's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of unemployment or involvement in risky activities. He's held only one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for various issues, including legal problems, health issues, and impaired judgment. Additionally, he's felt down for the past month, which could indicate depression. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area. A larger household might mean less individual attention, and urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates or exposure to risky environments. His belief that God has nothing to do with his life might suggest a lack of spiritual support, which can be a protective factor for some people.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, convictions, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, possible depression, and living alone. These factors are all pointing towards a high-risk scenario. His young age might mean he's still developing, but the accumulation of these issues is concerning.\n\nI think the prediction should be \"YES\" for high risk. As for confidence, considering the number of significant risk factors, I'd say around 85%. There's a strong indication here, but maybe not 100% because there might be mitigating factors not mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Drug use\", \"Possible depression\", \"Living alone\", \"Urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
