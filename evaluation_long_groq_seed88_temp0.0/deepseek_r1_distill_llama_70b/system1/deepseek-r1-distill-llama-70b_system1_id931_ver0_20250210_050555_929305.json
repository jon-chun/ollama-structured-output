    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female of mixed race. Age and gender can be factors, but race less so in many contexts. Being young might indicate less life experience, which could be a risk factor depending on other variables.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant because they indicate past involvement with the law, which could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risky behaviors.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'1\" and 135 lbs. These are physical attributes, but I don't see how they directly relate to risk factors unless in specific contexts like physical crimes, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Living alone at a young age might indicate independence, but it could also mean less support, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Employment instability can be a risk factor as it may indicate financial instability or difficulties in maintaining employment, which can lead to other issues.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, marijuana is generally considered less risky than other drugs, but it's still a factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive indicator. Current mental health status is important; not feeling depressed suggests better mental well-being, which can lower risk factors.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six. A large household might indicate a higher risk if it was due to overcrowding or economic hardship, but it could also mean a supportive family environment. The impact could go either way.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risk factors by providing a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors here are the criminal history (arrests and convictions), lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use. However, her current mental health is positive, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The other factors like age, living alone, and household size are less directly impactful.\n\nI think the presence of multiple negative factors (criminal history, education, employment, drug use) suggests a higher risk, but the absence of depression and religious support might lower the confidence a bit. So, I would predict high risk but with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
