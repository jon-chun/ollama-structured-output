    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in risky or illegal behavior, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a risk factor. Not being married and not living alone might indicate less stability or fewer ties to the community, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could point to issues with employment, which might be a stressor or indicator of other underlying problems.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is legal in some places, frequent use could impair judgment or be a sign of substance use issues, which can contribute to risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Depression can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with biological parents is generally a stable factor. Household size of four isn't particularly large, so that's neutral.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant factors are the multiple arrests, convictions, lack of education, and job instability. These are strong indicators of higher risk. However, the absence of depression and having a religious belief might lower the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards high risk but not with absolute certainty. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
