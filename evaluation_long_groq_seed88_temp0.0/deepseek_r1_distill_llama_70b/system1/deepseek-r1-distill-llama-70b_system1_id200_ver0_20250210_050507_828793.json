    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes. Arrests and convictions are often correlated with higher risk levels.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and between 150-174 lbs. That's within a normal range for his height, so I don't see that as a risk factor. Physical build doesn't typically indicate risk unless it's extreme, which it's not here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not being married at 22 isn't unusual, but living with others might indicate a lack of independence or stability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities and stability. Not attending college might limit his future prospects, which could contribute to higher risk factors, especially if he's struggling to find stable employment.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Changing jobs frequently might indicate issues with employment stability, which can lead to financial instability and other problems.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Recent use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, increases the risk.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase risk factors, especially if they lead to further substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four. A stable family background can be protective, but if there were issues within the family, it might not be. However, the information given doesn't specify any family problems, so this might be a lower risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he lacks a support system, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are the criminal history, drug use, mental health issues, and job instability. These factors together suggest a higher risk. However, some factors like education and living situation are less severe. So, I would predict a high risk but with moderate confidence because while there are several concerning factors, some elements like stable family background might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
