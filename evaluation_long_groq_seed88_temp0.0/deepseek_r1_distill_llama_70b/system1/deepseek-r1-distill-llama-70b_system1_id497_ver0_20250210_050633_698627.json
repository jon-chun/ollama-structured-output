    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'8\" and weighs 165 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor. She's married and living with her spouse, which could indicate stability, so that might lower risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. She's held one job during the year, which might indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and generally considered lower risk compared to other drugs, but it's still a factor. She's felt down some times in the past month. That could indicate mental health issues, which can be a risk factor if severe.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have different challenges, but living with a biological parent is usually a positive. She believes God influences her life, which might provide emotional support, potentially lowering risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the arrest, job stability, drug use, and mental health. However, the absence of a conviction, stable living situation, and religious support might mitigate these risks. So, I don't see a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\", \"mental health concerns (felt down)\", \"job stability (held 1 job in the past year)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
