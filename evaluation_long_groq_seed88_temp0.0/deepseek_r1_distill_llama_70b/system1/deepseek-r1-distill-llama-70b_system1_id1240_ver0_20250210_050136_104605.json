    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if he's committed serious offenses. This could indicate potential risk but isn't definitive.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 148 lbs. Physical characteristics don't typically indicate risk unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, but it might indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is associated with higher risk of unemployment and other issues.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which has higher potential for addiction and legal issues.\n\nFelt down in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which is a risk factor for self-harm or other negative behaviors.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area as a child. Larger household size might indicate less individual attention, but rural areas can have different challenges, like less access to resources.\n\nHe feels God has nothing to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social support, which might be a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: unemployment, lack of education, drug use, possible mental health issues, and social isolation are significant risk factors. However, the absence of convictions and the fact that he's living alone without other overt indicators might lower the confidence a bit. So, I'd predict high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\", \"social isolation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
