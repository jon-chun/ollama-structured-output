    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 22 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested six times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because multiple arrests and a conviction can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 170 lbs. Physical characteristics don't really play into risk assessment much, so I can probably ignore that. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's not a direct indicator. He hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might lower the risk compared to someone with current mental health issues.\n\nHis living situation as a child was with non-biological, non-foster, non-adoptive adults in a rural area. Unstable living conditions in childhood can be a risk factor for future issues. The household size was 2, which is small, but I'm not sure how that specifically impacts risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not as significant as other factors like criminal history or drug use.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, conviction, unemployment, drug use, and unstable childhood are all pointing towards a higher risk. However, the absence of recent depression might slightly lower the risk. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but maybe not the highest confidence because some factors are mixed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"unstable childhood\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
