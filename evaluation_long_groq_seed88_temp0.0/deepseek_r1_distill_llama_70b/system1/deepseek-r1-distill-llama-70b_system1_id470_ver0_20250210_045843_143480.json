    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior.\n\nHe's 5'4\" and 130 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight aren't typically strong indicators of risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not living alone might mean he has some family support, which could be a protective factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment and recidivism.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history can be a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, having jobs shows some stability, but frequent job changes might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other substances. However, since it's only marijuana, the risk might be lower compared to harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but the absence of recent depression might lower this aspect.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a small household in a rural area. A stable family environment can be protective, but rural areas might have different challenges, like less access to resources.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the conviction and lack of education are significant risk factors. However, the presence of a stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The drug use is moderate, and employment history is a bit mixed. Overall, while there are some concerning factors, they might not collectively indicate a high risk. So, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"conviction\",\n    \"lack of education\",\n    \"moderate drug use\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
