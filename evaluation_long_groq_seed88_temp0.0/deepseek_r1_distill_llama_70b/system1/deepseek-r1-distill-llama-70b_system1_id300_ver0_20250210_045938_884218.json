    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 21 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a point towards high risk.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 155 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually correlate strongly with risk, so I'll note that but it's probably not a major factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. Not being married at 21 isn't unusual, though.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, which might influence risk, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate financial instability or other issues.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent. Using drugs can lead to other risky behaviors and can be a sign of underlying issues.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger household might have more stressors, but living with a biological parent is generally a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: arrests, convictions, drug use, mental health issues, and job instability are all pointing towards higher risk. However, his education level and religious beliefs might mitigate some of that risk. I'm leaning towards high risk but not extremely certain. Maybe a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"drug_use\", \"mental_health_issues\", \"job_instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
