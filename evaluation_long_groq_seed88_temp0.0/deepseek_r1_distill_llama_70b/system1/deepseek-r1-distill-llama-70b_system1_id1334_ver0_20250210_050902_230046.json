    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This might indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 130 lbs. That's within a normal BMI range, so no health red flags there.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 could suggest independence, but it might also indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education often correlates with lower risk behaviors as it provides structure and future opportunities.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Having a job shows responsibility, but only having one job might indicate instability or perhaps she's focusing on studies, which is common for students.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common, especially among young adults, but it can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, she hasn't used it in the past month, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is good. Depression is a significant risk factor, so not experiencing it recently lowers the risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a larger household might mean more support, but urban areas can have higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor. However, living with her mother suggests a stable family environment.\n\nShe feels that God has nothing to do with her life. This could indicate a lack of religious support, which might be a protective factor for some, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are neutral or positive. The arrest and drug use are the main concerns, but without conviction or recent drug use, the risk isn't high. She's in school and employed, which are positive indicators. So, the overall risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
