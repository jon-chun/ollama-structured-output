    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. His age is relatively young, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of engaging in risky or illegal activities, which might point towards higher risk behavior.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 160 lbs. His physical characteristics don't immediately stand out as risk factors unless we're considering something specific, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator by itself.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but again, it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, suggesting possible issues with employment or financial stability.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of depression could be a positive factor, but mental health can be complex, and other issues might still be present.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment is generally a protective factor, which might lower risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and might reduce certain risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and criminal history stand out as significant risk factors. While other elements like living alone and job instability are present, they aren't as strong. The stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. So, I would predict high risk, but with moderate confidence because not all factors are strongly indicative.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
