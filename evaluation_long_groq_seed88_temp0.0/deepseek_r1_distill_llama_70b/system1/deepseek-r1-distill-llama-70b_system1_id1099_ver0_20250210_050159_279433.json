    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Hispanic alone isn't necessarily a risk factor. Next, he's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which definitely points towards a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 155 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. So I can probably disregard that.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes indicate stability. Not being married and not living alone might suggest a lack of stable social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes be linked to higher risk, as it might limit job opportunities and contribute to other issues. Holding only one job in the past year could indicate instability in employment, which is another risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism and other negative outcomes. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign because mental health issues can also contribute to risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological father in an urban area. Living with a biological parent can be a stabilizing factor, but urban environments might have higher crime rates or exposure to negative influences. His belief in God might provide some protective factor, as religious involvement can sometimes reduce risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, conviction, limited education, unstable employment, and drug use are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living with a parent and religious belief might mitigate risk a bit, the overall picture leans towards high risk. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Limited education and employment\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
