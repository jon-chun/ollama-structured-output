    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Black alone isn't a risk factor\u2014it's more about systemic issues. Next, he's been arrested 19 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests and a conviction, which definitely points towards a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 185 lbs. That's average build, so not particularly a risk factor. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. No high school diploma or GED and not in college\u2014lower education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. He's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit or impair judgment.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive, but mental health issues can fluctuate. Growing up, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family structure here seems stable. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life, which might indicate a lack of spiritual support, but that's more neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and living alone are strong indicators. His age is also a factor since younger individuals might still be in higher-risk phases. The confidence is high, but not 100% because there's no info on current behavior or support systems beyond what's given.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Unemployment\", \"No high school diploma or GED\", \"Drug use\", \"Living alone\", \"Young age\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 92\n}\n```",
