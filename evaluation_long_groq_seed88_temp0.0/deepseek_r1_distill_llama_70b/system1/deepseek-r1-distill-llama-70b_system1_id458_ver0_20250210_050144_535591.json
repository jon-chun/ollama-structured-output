Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate some risky behavior, but not definitively.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 155 lbs. That's within a normal range, so probably not a risk factor.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Divorce at a young age could indicate stress or instability, but living alone might also suggest independence. Not sure how this ties to risk.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate financial instability or other issues.\n\nShe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug. This could point to substance abuse issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of depression is a positive sign, but mental health can change, so it's something to note but not a current risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Large family size and urban environment might relate to socioeconomic status, which can be a risk factor, but again, not definitive.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use is a red flag, as is the job instability and young divorce. However, the lack of convictions and no current depression are positives. The other factors are neutral or mixed. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't overwhelmingly point to high risk. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\", \"young divorce\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
