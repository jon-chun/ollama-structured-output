    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on the context, but alone, they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might have been a minor offense, or perhaps the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as having a criminal record.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 155 lbs. That's within a normal range for his age and doesn't pose any particular risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, especially if he's just starting his independence. Not being married at this age is also common and doesn't necessarily indicate instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is a positive factor. Not attending college might limit future opportunities, but it's not a direct risk factor unless it's related to other issues like employment stability.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a risk factor if there's a pattern of frequent changes without good reason, but two jobs in a year could just mean he's exploring different opportunities or had temporary work.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is relatively common, especially among young adults. Unless it's heavy use or leading to other issues, it's not a major risk factor on its own.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive indicator. Mental health is important, and not feeling depressed suggests he's managing well in that aspect.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban environment can have its challenges, but living with a biological parent is a stable factor. Household size of three is average and doesn't indicate neglect or overcrowding.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and structure, which is generally a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these factors are neutral or positive. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern, but without more context, it's not enough to indicate high risk. His stable living situation, education, and mental health are all positives. Therefore, the overall risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"young age\", \"living alone\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
