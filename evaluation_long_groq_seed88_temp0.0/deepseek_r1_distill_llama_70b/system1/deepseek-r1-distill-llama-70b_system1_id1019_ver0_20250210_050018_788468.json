    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 147 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually correlate with risk behavior unless in extreme cases, which this isn't. So, probably not a significant factor.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of support system. Not married is common at his age, so maybe not a big risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect future opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not attending college isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it's due to other issues.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. This shows some stability and responsibility, which is a positive sign. It suggests he's employable and capable of maintaining work, which lowers risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. This is a strong positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, and avoiding it is a good sign. Not feeling depressed recently also lowers mental health risks.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household of six. A stable family background with both parents is a protective factor. Urban areas can have higher risks, but the family support likely mitigates that.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which is generally a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards low risk. The arrest is a concern, but without a conviction, it's not too severe. His stable upbringing, employment, and positive health indicators suggest he's at lower risk overall. So, I'd predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"living alone\", \"not in college\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
