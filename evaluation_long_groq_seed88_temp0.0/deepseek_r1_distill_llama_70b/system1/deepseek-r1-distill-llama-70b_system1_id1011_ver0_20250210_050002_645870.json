    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean he's had a run-in with the law, but it didn't lead to a guilty verdict. This might indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'5\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him stand out, physical size alone isn't a risk factor unless it's used in a harmful way, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, but it's not a direct risk factor. Not being married at 21 is pretty common, so that's probably not a big issue.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a factor, but one job in a year isn't necessarily unstable, especially at his age when people might be exploring careers.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and, while it can have risks, it's not as severe as other drugs. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living situations can increase risk factors, but urban areas also have more resources sometimes. The household size was 3, which isn't too large, so that might mitigate some risks.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these factors are either neutral or low risk. The arrest without conviction and living situation might be the only points that could indicate some risk, but they're not strong enough on their own. The lack of conviction, stable education, and religious support suggest lower risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"lived with non-biological adults as a child\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
