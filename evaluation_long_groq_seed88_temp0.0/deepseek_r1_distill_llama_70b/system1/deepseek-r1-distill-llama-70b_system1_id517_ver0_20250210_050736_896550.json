    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 185 lbs. His physical size might be a factor in certain contexts, but without more information, it's hard to assess how this contributes to risk. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college could indicate limited opportunities and higher stress, which might increase risk factors.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, which could mean instability or a struggle to maintain employment, potentially leading to financial stress. Drug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, is a red flag. Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month, which could point to mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can elevate risk factors. His living situation as a child\u2014living with both biological parents in an urban area of size five\u2014might not be a strong risk factor on its own, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates. His belief in God could be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the history of arrests, convictions, drug use, and mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living with both parents and religious beliefs might mitigate risk, the combination of negative factors leans towards a high-risk assessment. I'm about 85% confident in this prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"substance abuse\", \"mental health issues\", \"unstable employment\", \"lack of education\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
