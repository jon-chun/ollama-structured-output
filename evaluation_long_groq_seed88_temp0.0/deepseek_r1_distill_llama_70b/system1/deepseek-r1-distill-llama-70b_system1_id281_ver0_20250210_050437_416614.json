    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges, so maybe not a strong indicator.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 160 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest some independence, but not necessarily a risk factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor as it indicates he's engaged in productive activities. He's held one job in the past year, which shows some employment history, though maybe not extensive.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. However, he's felt down some times in the past month, which could indicate some mental health issues, but it's not severe enough to be a major risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five, which is a larger family. Larger households can sometimes have more stress, but it's not a direct risk factor. He believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor, providing support and structure.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are the arrests without convictions and some feelings of sadness. However, he's in school, employed, not using drugs, and has a spiritual outlook. These positive factors likely outweigh the negatives, so the risk might not be high. I'm about 65% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"felt down in the past month\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
