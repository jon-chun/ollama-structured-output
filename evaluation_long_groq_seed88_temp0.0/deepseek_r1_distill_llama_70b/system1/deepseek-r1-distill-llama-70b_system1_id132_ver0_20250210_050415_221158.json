    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how race plays into this beyond potential systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant because they indicate past involvement with the law, which could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. That's a point towards high risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 185 lbs. Physical size might be a factor in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can relate to social support. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor if someone is isolated.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment can limit opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can indicate instability or difficulty maintaining a job, which might contribute to higher risk if it leads to financial stress.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some drug use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor, especially if it's frequent or if it's impacting his life. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but still a factor.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in a household of five. Unstable living conditions in childhood can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including behavioral issues.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor if it provides emotional support, but it depends on how it's influencing his behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, limited education, unstable employment, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable childhood. These factors do point towards a higher risk. However, the presence of religious belief might offer some support. The confidence level is high because several significant risk factors are present, but not all are the most severe. So, I'd say high risk with around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"limited education\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"unstable childhood\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
