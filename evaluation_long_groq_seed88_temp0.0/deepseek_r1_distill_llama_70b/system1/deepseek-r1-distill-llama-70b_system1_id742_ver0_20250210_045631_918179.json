    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor because a history of multiple arrests and a conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that could be risky.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 170 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's married and living with his spouse, which might be a stabilizing factor, reducing risk. However, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor. He hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but he's been feeling down most of the time in the past month. This could indicate depression, which is a mental health concern and might increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background might be a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life, which might affect his support system or coping mechanisms, but this is less directly related to risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. The lack of education and job instability add to that. While marriage and stable living situation are positives, the overwhelming negative factors likely point to a high risk. His recent depression could also contribute if it's severe. So, I would predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Job instability\", \"Recent depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
