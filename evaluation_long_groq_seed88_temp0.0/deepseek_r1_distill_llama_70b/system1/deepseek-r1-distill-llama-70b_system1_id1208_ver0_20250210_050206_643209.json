    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might indicate less life experience. He's been arrested once and convicted, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending, but it's just one incident.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 145 lbs. That's a bit underweight for his height, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk factors. Maybe health issues, but not directly related to behavioral risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest some isolation or lack of support system, which could be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit opportunities, leading to higher risks of unemployment, poverty, and potentially criminal activity.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, another risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some depression symptoms. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, can increase risk behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks. Living with his mother might provide some stability, but the urban setting could be a negative influence.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose, which might lower risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and living situation are all risk factors. However, his belief in God might mitigate some risks. The factors don't seem overwhelmingly high, but they do present a moderate risk. So, I'd predict a moderate confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
