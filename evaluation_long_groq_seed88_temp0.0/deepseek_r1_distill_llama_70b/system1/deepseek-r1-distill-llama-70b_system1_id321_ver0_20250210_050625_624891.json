    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without other factors, it's not a big issue.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might have been a minor offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. Without a conviction, the risk here is lower than if he had a criminal record.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. Being 5'8\" and 160 lbs doesn't stand out as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially these days. Not being married at a young age doesn't necessarily indicate instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is a positive factor. Not attending college might limit his opportunities, but it doesn't directly indicate risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a concern. Changing jobs frequently might suggest issues with employment, but it could also mean he's exploring different opportunities or industries.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so not using drugs is a good sign.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health is crucial, and not experiencing depression is a positive indicator.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a large household in an urban area. A stable family environment with both parents can be protective. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors here are either neutral or positive. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern, but without other issues, it doesn't point to high risk. The job changes could be a slight concern but not enough on their own. Overall, the positive factors like education, no drug use, stable upbringing, and mental health outweigh the minor concerns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 3 jobs in a year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
