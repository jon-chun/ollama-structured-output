    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could indicate potential issues, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a risk factor. Being single and living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being enrolled in college might limit his future prospects, but it's not a direct risk indicator.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially cocaine, is a strong risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nHe's experienced feelings of being down in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which is a risk factor for self-harm, substance abuse, and other negative behaviors.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. A larger household might indicate economic stress or less individual attention, which can be a risk factor. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could contribute to risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on the individual. For some, it might reduce a sense of community or support, which could be a risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and mental health issues are the most concerning. The arrest and job instability add to the risk. However, the lack of conviction and having a high school diploma are mitigating factors. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but the confidence isn't 100% because some factors are less severe.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"mental health concerns (felt down in the past month)\", \"arrest history\", \"job instability\", \"living alone\", \"lack of higher education\", \"upbringing in a large household\", \"lack of religious belief\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
