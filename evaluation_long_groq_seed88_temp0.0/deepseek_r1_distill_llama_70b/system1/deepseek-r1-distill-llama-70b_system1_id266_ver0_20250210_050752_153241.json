    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher risk of reoffending, depending on the nature of the offense. However, since it's only one arrest and conviction, I'm not sure if that's enough on its own.\n\nHe's 5 feet 6 inches tall. I don't think height is a significant risk factor here. It doesn't really correlate with behavior or risk levels.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone could be a minor risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a red flag. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates and can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with maintaining employment, which could lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, since it's only mentioned as past use, it might not be as significant as other factors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he's not currently depressed, that's a good indicator.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so growing up there might expose him to more risks. Living with a biological parent is generally positive, but the urban setting could be a negative factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, and urban upbringing are risk factors. However, his religious beliefs and lack of current depression might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" but with lower confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
