    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but in this case, being young might indicate less life experience, but I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's unclear how serious those incidents were. It could indicate a higher risk if the arrests were for serious offenses, but without that info, it's a bit of a neutral point.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 156 lbs. That's within a normal range, so I don't see that as a risk factor.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing risk. So that's a positive point.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so her education level is complete. Not being in college doesn't necessarily indicate a risk; many people don't pursue higher education and do just fine.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a risk factor if it's due to instability, but having one job might just mean she's in a steady position, so I'm not sure if this is a high risk.\n\nShe used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially with a substance like cocaine, can be a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, health problems, and other risky behaviors.\n\nShe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse, poor decision-making, and other health concerns.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but a stable family structure with biological parents might mitigate some of that risk.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behaviors and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors here are the drug use and the recent feelings of depression. These two factors are strong indicators of potential high risk. The arrests without convictions and job stability are less clear. Her stable living situation and religious beliefs might lower the risk a bit, but the drug use and mental health issues are concerning. So, I think the prediction is YES, but the confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are mitigating. Maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (cocaine)\", \"mental health issues (depression)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
