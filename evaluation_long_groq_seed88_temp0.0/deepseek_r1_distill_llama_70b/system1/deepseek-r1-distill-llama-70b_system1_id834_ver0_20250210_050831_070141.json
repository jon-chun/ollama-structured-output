    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior. However, it's just one arrest and conviction, so I need to consider the context, like the severity of the offense, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. His height and weight don't seem directly related to risk factors unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here. He's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes relate to stability, but not necessarily risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but it's not a direct risk factor. He's held two jobs in the past year, which might indicate some instability or perhaps he's just exploring career options. Employment history can be a factor, but two jobs in a year isn't too concerning.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive because substance abuse and mental health issues can significantly increase risk. His upbringing was with his biological mother in a large household, which might suggest a stable family environment, though large families can sometimes have their own challenges.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose. \n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the arrest and conviction. Without knowing the details of the offense, it's hard to gauge the severity. However, considering the other factors like stable mental health, no recent substance abuse, and a supportive belief system, the overall risk might not be high. His employment and education status are neutral to slightly positive. So, I'm leaning towards a low risk assessment with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once and convicted\", \"held 2 jobs during the year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
