    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race isn't typically a direct indicator. So, I don't think race is a significant factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It's something to note but maybe not a major red flag.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 195 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but unless there's a health issue, this alone isn't a risk factor. Maybe if there's a history of health problems, but that's not mentioned.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not definitive. It depends on other factors too.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or other issues, so this is something to consider.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, or other behavioral problems. This is a red flag.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive, but mental health can change, so it's something to monitor but not an immediate risk.\n\nHe grew up in a household of seven in an urban area. A large household might indicate overcrowding or resource strain, which can contribute to stress or other issues. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's another point to consider.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use is a significant risk factor. Unemployment and living alone might contribute, but without more context, they're moderate. The arrests without convictions are a concern but not as severe. The living situation as a child could have some impact but isn't as direct.\n\nSo, I think the main risk here is the drug use. The other factors add some risk but not extremely high. Therefore, the prediction is YES, but the confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"unemployment\", \"arrests without conviction\", \"living alone\", \"large household in urban area\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
