    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could indicate a lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall. Height alone isn't a risk factor unless it's in a context where it might intimidate others, but that's speculative.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for mental health issues, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect job prospects, which might tie into economic stability, a known risk factor for various issues.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate financial instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years. This is a positive factor, as drug use is a known risk factor for many issues, so not using is a lower risk.\n\nHe's felt down some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, which is a risk factor for mental health issues, but it's not severe enough to be a high risk on its own.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a larger household might have its challenges, but urban areas can have varying levels of support and risk factors. It's a neutral factor unless there were specific negatives like poverty or violence.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. This can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of community, which can lower risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest, job instability, and recent feelings of being down. However, the absence of drug use, having a high school diploma, and religious beliefs are protective factors. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. The overall risk seems moderate, but not high. So, the prediction is NO with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"job instability\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
