    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but in this case, they don't immediately stand out as high risk indicators. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor. She's never been married and isn't living alone. Not living alone could mean she has some support system, which might lower risk. Not being married at 19 is pretty common, so that's probably not a big issue.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities and lead to financial instability. She's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial problems or personal issues.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a bigger risk factor, so this is good. However, she's felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month. That could indicate mild depression or emotional distress, which is a risk factor for mental health issues.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size two at a young age. A smaller household might mean less support, but it's not necessarily a strong indicator. She doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the lack of education, job instability, and recent feelings of depression. However, she hasn't used drugs recently, which is a positive. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk. So, I would predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
