    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. So, this might not be a significant factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 155 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. Being underweight could be a health concern, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment unless it's related to other factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially if he's in college. Not being married at this age is pretty common, so this might not be a significant risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. This is a positive factor. Education is often associated with lower risk behaviors as it can provide stability and better opportunities.\n\nHe's held 5 jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with commitment, behavior, or perhaps he's still figuring out his career path. However, at 20, it's not too uncommon as people explore different fields.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is widespread, especially among young adults. While drug use can be a risk factor, marijuana is generally considered lower risk compared to other substances. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign. Recent mental health stability is good.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size 4. A larger family might have provided more support, but it's not directly a risk factor unless there were issues like neglect or abuse, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nPutting it all together, the main potential risk factors are the arrest and job instability. However, the lack of conviction and his current enrollment in college are positive signs. His drug use is relatively low risk, and he's mentally stable now. So, while there are some flags, they don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. I'd say the confidence is around 20% for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 5 jobs in a year\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
