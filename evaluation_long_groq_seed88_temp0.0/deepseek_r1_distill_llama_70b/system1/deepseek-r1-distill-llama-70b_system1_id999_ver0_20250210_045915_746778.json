    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Being young might mean she's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested six times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 170 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 30, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to various health issues, which might be a risk factor for health-related problems, but I'm not sure how this ties into behavioral or legal risk.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 19 is pretty common, so that's not a big deal. Not living alone could mean she has a support system, which might be a protective factor, reducing risk.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school. Education is generally a positive factor as it can lead to better opportunities and stability, which might lower risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor for financial instability or other problems.\n\nShe's used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to addiction, legal issues, and other negative behaviors. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban household of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which might lower risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents might mitigate that.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the multiple arrests and convictions are big red flags. Drug use is another concern. However, being in school, living with family, and religious beliefs are positive factors that might reduce risk. Her age and current enrollment in school suggest she's in a phase where she might be turning her life around. The job changes could be due to her being a student and still figuring things out.\n\nSo, while there are some risk factors like criminal history and drug use, the presence of protective factors like education and family support might lower the overall risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. Maybe a confidence level around 60% for indicating some risk, but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Drug use\", \"Job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
