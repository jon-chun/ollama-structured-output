    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, though it's just one incident.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 210 lbs. His physical size might be relevant in certain contexts, like if he's involved in physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which might be a risk factor for mental health issues, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college is positive; education usually correlates with lower risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a stronger indicator of risk, so this is good.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month. This indicates possible depression or low mental health, which can be a risk factor for self-harm or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4 at a young age. A stable family environment is generally a protective factor, so this might lower his risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal happenings. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors and providing a support network.\n\nPutting it all together: he has a conviction, which is a risk factor, and unemployment, which could be a risk. However, he's educated, not using drugs, has a stable upbringing, and religious support. The mental health concern is there but not severe enough based on the information. So, the overall risk seems moderate. I'll predict \"NO\" with 70% confidence because the positive factors outweigh the negatives, but there are some concerns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"unemployment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
