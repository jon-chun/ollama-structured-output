    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant because they indicate a history of legal issues, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other problematic behaviors.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 195 lbs. While this might make him physically imposing, without context on how he uses his size, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky activities.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might relate to financial instability or other stressors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years. This is a positive factor, as drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes. However, he has felt down recently. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can be a risk factor if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four. Household size isn't a strong indicator, but it might relate to family support or overcrowding, which can influence behavior.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: the history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of potential high risk. However, the absence of drug use and the presence of religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The lack of education and job instability are concerning but not as severe as the legal history. The mental health aspect of feeling down could increase risk if it leads to further issues.\n\nI think the legal history is the most significant factor here, so the prediction is YES, but the confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
