    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean he's had a run-in with the law, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 165 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's married and living with his spouse, which is a positive factor as it suggests stability and support.\n\nHe has a GED, so he completed his education, but he's not in college. Not being enrolled in college isn't necessarily a risk factor, but it might relate to employment opportunities. He hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which could indicate unemployment. Unemployment can be a risk factor for various issues, including financial instability or increased stress.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it most of the time in the past month. Marijuana use, especially frequent, can be a concern, but it's not as severe as harder drugs. However, it could indicate a substance use issue, especially if it's affecting his mood or daily life.\n\nHe's felt down most of the time in the past month, which is a clear indicator of depression. Depression is a significant risk factor for mental health issues, which can lead to other problems like substance abuse or social withdrawal.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with a household size of five. A stable family background is a protective factor, but living in a rural area might have limited access to resources or support. He believes God has a role in his life, which can be a positive coping mechanism, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together: the main concerns are unemployment, recent marijuana use, and depression. These factors can interact. Unemployment can lead to feeling down, which might be exacerbated by substance use. However, he has a stable family life and a belief system that might help mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk because while there are concerning factors like depression and substance use, there are also protective factors like a stable marriage and family background. The confidence level is around 60% because the risk isn't extremely high, but it's notable enough to warrant attention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"unemployment\", \"marijuana use\", \"depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
