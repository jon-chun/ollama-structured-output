    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if she's a high risk. Maybe she's had some issues, but not severe enough to lead to convictions.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'1\" and 130 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is pretty common, so I don't see that as a high risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit her future, but it's not a direct risk indicator.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or other issues, but it depends on the context. Maybe she's looking for work or has other support.\n\nShe used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Cocaine can lead to addiction and other problems, so this is a red flag.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive, but it doesn't rule out other mental health issues or past problems.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four when young. Stable family environment as a child is a protective factor, so that's good.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spirituality can be a positive coping mechanism, so that's a good sign.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the drug use and unemployment. However, she hasn't been convicted, has a stable upbringing, and is spiritually active. The drug use is concerning, but without more information on frequency or current usage, it's hard to gauge the severity. Her other factors seem to mitigate the risk somewhat. So, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not high. Therefore, the prediction is NO with a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested twice\", \"unemployed\", \"past cocaine use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
