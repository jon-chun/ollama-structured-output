Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of criminal behavior, which might suggest a higher risk of reoffending. That's a significant factor.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 155 lbs. Physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk behavior, so I can probably ignore that.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Marital status and living situation can affect social support. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which in turn can influence risk factors. Limited education might lead to lower stability, but he has held two jobs, which shows some employment history, though maybe not stable.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some drug use in the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and mental health concerns. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but still a factor.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or mental health issues, which are risk factors for self-harm or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests, convictions, drug use, and mental health issues are the main risk factors. However, he has some protective factors like education, employment, and religious beliefs. The risk is present but not extremely high. So, I'd predict a moderate risk, maybe a 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"drug_use\", \"mental_health_issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
