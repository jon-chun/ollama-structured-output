    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. His age is relatively young, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and between 175-199 lbs. That's within a normal range for his height, so I don't see that as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability or involvement in other risky activities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor as it might lead to financial difficulties, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities or other high-risk behaviors.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can sometimes be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can also contribute to higher risk behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of three. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, but this alone isn't a strong indicator. Living with his biological mother might provide some stability, but the household size isn't particularly large or small.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he doesn't have a support system, but it's not a major indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant factors here are the multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These collectively point towards a higher risk. However, the absence of more severe factors like violence or harder drug use might lower the confidence a bit. So, I would predict high risk with a confidence level around 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
