    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 160 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially if he's in college. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college is a positive factor\u2014it shows he's pursuing education, which can lower risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. That could indicate responsibility or possibly instability, but without more context, it's hard to say. He used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a serious drug. However, he hasn't used it in the past month, so maybe he's stopped or reduced usage.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. His living situation as a child was stable with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but he had a stable family setup. He believes God has a role in his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the past cocaine use, but he hasn't used it recently. The rest of his factors are either neutral or positive. So, the overall risk seems low. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"past drug use (cocaine)\", \"arrest without conviction\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
