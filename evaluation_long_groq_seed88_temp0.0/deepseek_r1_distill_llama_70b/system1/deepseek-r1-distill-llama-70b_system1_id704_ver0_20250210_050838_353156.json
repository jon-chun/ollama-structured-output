    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested six times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of multiple arrests and convictions suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight aren't typically strong indicators of risk. Her marital status is never married, which might relate to stability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. She's not living alone, which could mean she has some support, but it could also mean she's in a shared environment that might have its own issues.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment and criminal behavior. She's held two jobs in the past year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, she's been feeling down lately, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression can be a risk factor if left untreated, as it might lead to other problems.\n\nShe grew up with her biological dad in a large household in a rural area. Living in a rural area might have different implications, such as access to resources or support. Her belief in God could be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. The lack of education and job instability add to that. While she hasn't used drugs recently and has some potential support from her beliefs, the criminal history and socioeconomic factors are significant. I'm about 85% confident that these factors indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
