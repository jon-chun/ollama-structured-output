    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can indicate a higher risk, especially if the conviction is recent or related to violent offenses. However, the type of crime isn't specified here, so I'm not sure how severe it was.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 155 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this isn't.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing risk as it indicates support and stability.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect socioeconomic status, but having a diploma is a positive sign. Not being in college doesn't necessarily increase risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are known risk factors, so their absence lowers risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, though a large household in an urban area might have its own challenges, like limited resources or higher exposure to environmental risks.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors by promoting resilience and positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction is a red flag, but other factors like stable marriage, education, no drug use, and supportive upbringing counterbalance it. The job changes are a minor concern but not a major risk. Overall, the risk seems moderate, but not high. So, I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
