    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male of Asian/Pacific Islander descent. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher risk behaviors sometimes.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not be a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This isn't a clear indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a factor here. Being 5'10\" and 175-199 lbs doesn't stand out as risky.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't in college now. Education is usually a positive factor, associated with lower risks in many areas. However, not being enrolled could mean he's working or looking for work, which isn't necessarily risky.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with employment, which can relate to financial instability or other stressors.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, since it's not specified as heavy use, it's a moderate concern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Current mental health is good, which lowers some risks.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor. Urban environments can have their own risks, but with a stable home, it's probably not a major issue.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The job instability and past drug use are the main points. However, his education, stable upbringing, and current mental health are positives. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't add up to a high risk. So, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
