    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are definitely risk factors, especially for recidivism. More arrests usually correlate with higher risk, so this is a red flag.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 195 lbs. Physical size might be a factor in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but alone, it's not a strong indicator of risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests he's trying to improve his situation, which might lower risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but job instability (having two jobs) might indicate some issues, though it's not a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for self-harm, substance abuse, or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban household of five. A stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments might have higher exposure to crime or other risks.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and providing a support network.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrests, convictions, drug use, and possible mental health issues are significant risk factors. However, his education and employment are positive factors that might mitigate some risks. The presence of a stable upbringing and religious beliefs could also be protective. So, while there are definite risk factors, the presence of protective factors might lower the overall risk assessment. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so confidence might be around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"drug_use\", \"mental_health_issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
