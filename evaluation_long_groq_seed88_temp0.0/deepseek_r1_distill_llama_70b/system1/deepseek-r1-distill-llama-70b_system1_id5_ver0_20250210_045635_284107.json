    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if he's a repeat offender or just had some bad encounters.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but not necessarily a risk factor unless related to health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which might be a risk factor for mental health issues or other behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, suggesting possible issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it all the time in the past month. Regular drug use, especially if it's impacting his life, could be a risk factor for dependency or other issues.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month, which is a clear indicator of depression. That's a significant mental health concern and can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant factors are the recent depression, regular drug use, and possibly the job instability. These could indicate a higher risk for mental health issues, potential substance abuse, and personal instability. However, without convictions, the arrest history is less concerning. The confidence level is moderate because while there are concerning factors, some elements like the arrests without convictions and living situation aren't as severe.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"drug use\", \"depression\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
