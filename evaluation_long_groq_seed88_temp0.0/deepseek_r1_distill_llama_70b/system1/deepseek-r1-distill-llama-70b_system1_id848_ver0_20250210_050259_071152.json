    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race isn't typically a direct indicator. So, I don't think race is a significant factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but without convictions, it's not as severe. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that might be concerning.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 155 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't see that as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some level of independence, but it could also suggest isolation or lack of support systems, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky activities. Education is often a protective factor, so not having it could increase risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor for financial instability, which might lead to other issues like substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including health issues, legal problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nHe's felt down and uncheerable for some time in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for substance abuse, self-harm, or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size three at a young age. A stable family environment can be protective, but if there were issues in the household, that could be a risk. However, the information given doesn't specify any problems, so I might not weigh this too heavily.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and a sense of community, which might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, and possible mental health issues are all significant risk factors. While religious beliefs might help, the other factors are quite concerning. So, I would predict a high risk with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\", \"possible mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
