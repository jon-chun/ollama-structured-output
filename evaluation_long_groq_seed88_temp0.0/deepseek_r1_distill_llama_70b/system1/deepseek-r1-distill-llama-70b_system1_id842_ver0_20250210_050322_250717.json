    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own. Next, he's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 145 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk, so I'll note that but not give it much weight.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a major one. Being enrolled in school is a positive factor; education can reduce risk by providing structure and opportunities.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having only one job might indicate instability, but again, not a major factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a small household, which is a stable upbringing, a positive factor. He believes God has a role in his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests and convictions are concerning, as is the drug use. However, he's in school, had a job, a stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. These positive factors might mitigate the risks. So, while there are some risk factors, the presence of stabilizing elements might lower the overall risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate confidence that the risk isn't high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
