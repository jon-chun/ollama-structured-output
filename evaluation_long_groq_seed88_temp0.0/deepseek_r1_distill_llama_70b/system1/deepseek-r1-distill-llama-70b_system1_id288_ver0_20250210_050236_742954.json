    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're recent or related to serious offenses, but without knowing the nature of the crimes, it's a bit unclear.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 137 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless there's something specific, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if it contributes to social isolation, but it's also common and not inherently risky. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college is a positive factor, suggesting stability and a lower risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a risk factor if there's frequent job changes, but two jobs in a year isn't necessarily unstable, especially if she's a student.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent or frequent. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which lowers risk. Believing that God has something to do with her life might provide emotional support, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and criminal history are concerning, but her education, stable upbringing, and current mental state are positive. I'm leaning towards a lower risk prediction, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe around 30% confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
