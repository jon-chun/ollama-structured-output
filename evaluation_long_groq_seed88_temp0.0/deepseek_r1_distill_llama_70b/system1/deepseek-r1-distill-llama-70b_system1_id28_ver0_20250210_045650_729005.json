    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age is on the lower side, but being female might generally be associated with lower risk in some contexts, though it's not a major factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things\u2014maybe she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps the charges were dropped. It's a bit of a red flag, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'6\" and 180 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 30, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to various health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain outcomes, but I'm not sure how it ties into behavioral or legal risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could indicate independence, but it might also suggest a lack of support system or stability. Not being married at a young age isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. This could mean she's entering the workforce, which is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, potentially increasing certain risks related to employment stability.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with employment retention, which could relate to financial instability or other personal issues.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but past drug use is still concerning.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which might lower her risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but having both parents around might mitigate that.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use and job instability are notable risks. However, her stable upbringing, lack of convictions, and religious beliefs are protective. The absence of depression is also a positive sign. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to indicate a high overall risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
