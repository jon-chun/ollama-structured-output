    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests, which might point to a pattern of behavior that could be risky.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 105 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 21 isn't unusual, and living situation can vary, but living with others might indicate a support system, which could be a protective factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being enrolled in college isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Job stability can be a factor; having only one job might indicate instability or perhaps she's just starting her career, so it's a bit of a neutral point.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so the impact might be lower.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health is important, but not feeling depressed is a positive sign. It suggests she's currently in a better mental state.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a larger household in an urban area might have its challenges, but without more details, it's hard to assess the risk from this alone.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with her personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a risk if she doesn't have other support systems, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators. However, she has some protective factors like education and not currently feeling depressed. The drug use is present but not as severe as harder drugs. Her living situation and job stability are somewhat neutral.\n\nSo, considering the significant number of arrests and convictions, I would lean towards a high risk prediction, but with moderate confidence because other factors mitigate the risk to some extent.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"Limited job stability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
