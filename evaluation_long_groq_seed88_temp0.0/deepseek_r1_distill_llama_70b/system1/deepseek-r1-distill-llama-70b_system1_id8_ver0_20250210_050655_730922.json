    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and weighs 159 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height, which could indicate possible health issues or neglect, but not necessarily a direct risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college is a positive sign, indicating he's on a path towards higher education, which usually correlates with lower risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having some employment history is positive, showing responsibility. Now, he has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially cocaine, can be a significant risk factor as it's associated with higher risk behaviors and potential for addiction or relapse.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is good because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to risk factors. His living situation as a child was with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Growing up in an urban area with a larger family might have some challenges, but it's not a clear indicator on its own.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors here are the arrest and drug use. However, he's in college, employed, and has a supportive belief system. The lack of conviction and positive life choices might mitigate the risk. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't overwhelmingly point to a high risk. Therefore, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
