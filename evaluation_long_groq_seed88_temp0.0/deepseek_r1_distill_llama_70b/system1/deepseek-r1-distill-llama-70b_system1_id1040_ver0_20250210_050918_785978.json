    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can be factors, but I'm not sure how significant they are on their own. Being young might mean she's still developing and could be more influenced by her environment.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as severe as a conviction, but it still indicates some involvement with the law, which could point to higher risk behavior.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'3\" and between 175-199 lbs. That puts her BMI in the obese category, which can lead to health issues, but I'm not sure how this ties into risk assessment unless we're considering health risks specifically.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase certain risks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other personal issues.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a clear risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for substance abuse, poor decision-making, and other problems.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. A large household might mean less individual attention, and urban areas can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risky behaviors.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This could affect her support system or coping mechanisms, but I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Young age, lack of education, job instability, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone are all pointing towards higher risk. The arrest and conviction, even if not convicted, add to that. So, I think the prediction should be YES, and confidence is high, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"living alone\", \"arrest history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
