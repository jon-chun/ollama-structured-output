    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can point to a higher risk, especially if it's related to violent or repeat offenses. However, the type of crime isn't specified here, so I have to consider it as a general risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 220 lbs. That gives him a BMI of around 33, which is obese. Obesity can lead to various health issues, which might contribute to other risks, but on its own, it's more of a health risk than a direct behavioral risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor for mental health issues or other behaviors, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Educational attainment can affect socioeconomic status and opportunities, which might influence risk factors, but again, it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could suggest issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or personal issues, but it's not a clear-cut risk factor without more context.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to addiction and other problems. Recent use in the past month is a red flag.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can increase risk if left untreated.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of five. Growing up in a stable family might be a protective factor, but urban environments can have higher crime rates or other stressors.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. This could affect his coping mechanisms or support systems, but it's more about personal belief and not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the key risk factors are the criminal conviction, drug use (especially cocaine), recent depressive feelings, and job instability. These factors together suggest a higher risk, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors like living situation and education are neutral or less impactful. So, I'll predict high risk with about 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal conviction\", \"drug use\", \"depressive feelings\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
