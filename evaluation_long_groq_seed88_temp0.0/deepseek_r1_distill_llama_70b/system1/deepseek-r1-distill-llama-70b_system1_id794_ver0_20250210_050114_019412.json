    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 20 isn't necessarily high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which definitely points towards a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 170 lbs. Physical characteristics don't really indicate risk here. Not married and not living alone\u2014being unmarried and living with others might not be a strong indicator, but sometimes living situation can influence behavior, though it's not a major factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, which might relate to risk, but having a diploma is a positive. He's held 2 jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or perhaps just exploring career options, not a strong risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or associated with other issues, but marijuana alone might not be as significant as harder drugs.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so not feeling depressed is a good sign. He lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the multiple arrests and conviction. However, other factors like stable upbringing, education, and lack of depression might mitigate some of that risk. So, while there's some risk, it's not extremely high. I'll predict \"YES\" for high risk but with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Drug use\", \"Job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
