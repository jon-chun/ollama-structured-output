    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure how significant age is here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might mean he was involved in something illegal, but not enough for a conviction. That could still indicate some level of risk, but it's not as severe as a conviction.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and 170 lbs. His height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors. Maybe in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but alone, they don't say much.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is pretty common, so that's probably not a big factor. Not living alone could mean he has family support, which might lower risk, but it depends on the living situation.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so that's not a negative. Not being in college is common for his age, so I don't see that as a major risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job stability can be a factor. Two jobs in a year might indicate some instability or maybe just exploring different opportunities. It's a bit neutral.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, or impaired judgment. Cocaine, in particular, is a harder drug and might pose a higher risk than marijuana.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Lack of depression could mean he's mentally stable, which might lower risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban area can have various influences, both positive and negative. Without more context, it's hard to say, but urban environments might have higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or outlook on life. Some studies suggest religious involvement can be a protective factor, so not having that might slightly increase risk, but it's not a major factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest, drug use, and maybe the living situation. However, the lack of conviction, stable living with family, and no recent depression are mitigating factors. The drug use is concerning, but without knowing the frequency or current usage, it's hard to gauge. Overall, I think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, I'll predict \"YES\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"drug use\", \"living situation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
