    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of problematic behavior, which might suggest higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'3\" and 145 lbs. Physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk behavior, so I can probably set that aside. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, which might influence risk, but it's not a direct indicator. He's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could point to issues with commitment or behavior, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a bigger risk, so this is good. However, he's felt down lately. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if they're severe or untreated.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. Family stability is a protective factor, but urban environments might have higher exposure to risks. He doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests and convictions are significant. Job instability and mental health issues add to the risk. However, no recent drug use is a mitigating factor. I'm leaning towards high risk, but not extremely high. Maybe a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"convicted\", \"held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month\", \"lived with biological dad in an urban area\", \"does not believe God influences personal events\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
