Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 260 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
