He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 137 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area.
