Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 7 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in a rural area.
